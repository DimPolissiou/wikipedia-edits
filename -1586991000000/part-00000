Around the same time, [[Rigvedic tribes|Indo-Aryan tribes]] moved into the [[Punjab]] from regions further northwest in several [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|waves of migration]].  The resulting [[Vedic Period|Vedic period]] was marked by the composition of the [[Vedas]], large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture, through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, gave rise to [[Hinduism]]. The [[Caste system of India|caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose later during this period. Towards the end of the period, around 600 BCE, after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture,  a second urbanisation took place. The small Indo-Aryan chieftaincies, or [[janapada]]s, were consolidated into larger states, or [[mahajanapadas]]. This urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new [[\u015arama\u1e47a|ascetic]] movements, including [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], which challenged the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion,<ref name=\"Flood 1996 82\"/> and gave rise to new religious concepts.<ref>Flood, Gavin.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern [[Badami]]) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] kingdom of [[Banavasi]] and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of [[Pulakeshin&nbsp;II]]. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of [[South India]] and a golden age in the history of [[Karnataka]]. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the [[Kaveri]] and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". The [[Chalukya dynasty]] ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]] between 970 and 1190.\n\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=180|lines=4\n|File:Galaganatha Temple, Pattadakal, Karnataka.jpg|Galaganatha Temple at [[Pattadakal|Pattadakal complex]] ([[UNESCO World Heritage]]) is an example of [[Badami Chalukya architecture]].\n|File:View of Bhutanatha temple in Badami during monsoon.jpg|[[Bhutanatha group of temples, Badami|Bhutanatha temple complex]] at [[Badami]], next to a [[waterfall]], during the monsoon.\n|File:Vishnu image inside cave number 3 in Badami.jpg|[[Vishnu]] image inside the [[Badami cave temples|Badami Cave Temple Complex]].

While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp=50\u201352}} However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=re2000>Richard Eaton (2000), [http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/283.extract Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States], Journal of Islamic Studies, 11(3), pp. 283\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of India]] were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate. A major factor in their success was their Turkic [[Mamluk]] slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic [[cavalry]] warfare as the [[Mongols]], as a result of having similar [[nomad]]ic Central Asian roots.

The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], [[Bharatpur State|Jats]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]]. In 1737, the Maratha general [[Bajirao]] of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao, however, easily routed the novice Mughal general and the rest of the imperial Mughal army fled.

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company.

The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of ''treaty of Gajendragad'', in which, Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] took place, where the Mysoreans used the [[Mysorean rockets]]. The [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1798\u20131799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)]].\n\nHyderabad was founded by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] of [[Golconda]] in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad]] in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the [[Battle of Palkhed]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=Bajirao+I#v=onepage&q=Bajirao%20I ''History Modern India'' By S.N.

It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Masulipatnam]] on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and the grant of the rights to establish a factory in [[Surat]] in 1612 by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.  In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara ruler]] farther south, a second factory was established in [[Madras]] on the southeastern coast. [[Bombay]] island, not far from Surat, a former Portuguese outpost gifted to [[Kingdom of England|England]] as [[dowry]] in the marriage of [[Catherine of Braganza]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was leased by the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the Company established a presence on the eastern coast as well; far up that coast, in the [[Ganges River]] delta, a factory was set up in Calcutta. Since, during this time other ''companies''\u2014established by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Danish East India Company|Danish]]\u2014were similarly expanding in the region, the English Company's unremarkable beginnings on [[coastal India]] offered no clues to what would become a lengthy presence on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Company's victory under [[Robert Clive]] in the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]] and another victory in the 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]] (in Bihar), consolidated the Company's power, and forced emperor [[Shah Alam II]] to appoint it the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'', or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and [[Odisha|Orissa]].  The Company thus became the ''de facto'' ruler of large areas of the [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests|lower Gangetic plain]] by 1773.  It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1766\u201399) and the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] (1772\u20131818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the [[Sutlej River]]. With the defeat of the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], no native power represented a threat for the Company any longer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Markovits|2004|pp=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the Company's power chiefly took two forms.  The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions, which collectively came to comprise [[British India]].  The annexed regions included the [[North-Western Provinces]] (comprising [[Rohilkhand]], [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], and the [[Doab]]) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ([[Ahom Kingdom]] 1828), and [[Sindh]] (1843). [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]], and [[Kashmir]], were annexed after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]] in 1849\u201356 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General); however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] (1850) to the [[Dogra Dynasty]] of [[Jammu]], and thereby became a princely state.

It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of large [[Indian diaspora]], which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. [[Fiji]]), as well as the growth of [[Indo-Caribbean]] and [[Indo-African]] population.\n\n==Modern period and independence (after c. 1850 CE)==\n===Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences===\n{{Main|Indian rebellion of 1857}}\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=140|lines=4\n|File:Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning - Project Gutenberg eText 16528.jpg|[[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]], the [[Governor-General of India]] during the rebellion.\n|File:Dalhousie.jpg|[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Rani of jhansi.jpg|[[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi]], one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Bahadur Shah II of India.jpg|[[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n}}\nThe Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the Company's rule.

Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], and felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=91}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in [[Meerut]], the rebels very quickly reached [[Delhi]].

The Crown controlled the Company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir).

The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. Also in early 1946, new elections were called and [[Congress]] candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\n\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end [[United Kingdom|British]] rule of [[India]], and in early 1947 [[United Kingdom|Britain]] announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an [[Interim Government of India|interim government]].\n\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the Indian subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership.\n\nMuslim League leader [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] proclaimed 16 August 1946 as [[Direct Action Day]], with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"[[Direct Action Day|Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946]]\". The communal violence spread to [[Bihar]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), to [[Noakhali]] in Bengal (where Hindus were targeted by Muslims), in [[Garhmukteshwar]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), and on to [[Rawalpindi]] in March 1947 in which Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\n\n====Independence and partition (c. 1947\u2013present)====\n{{Main|Partition of India|History of the Republic of India|History of Pakistan|History of Bangladesh}}\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|width=180 |lines=4\n|File:Brit IndianEmpireReligions3.jpg|A map of the prevailing religions of the British Indian empire based on district-wise majorities based on the Indian census of 1909, and published in the [[Imperial Gazetteer of India]].

In particular, the partition of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies. <ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Mountbatten''(1985) p. 401.</ref><ref name=symonds>{{cite book| last = Symonds | first = Richard | author-link=Richard Symonds (academic) | title = The Making of Pakistan | year = 1950 | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | oclc = 1462689 | page = 74| quote = At the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve millions became homeless.}}</ref><ref name=\"Abid2014\">{{cite web |last1=Abid |first1=Abdul Majeed |title=The forgotten massacre |url=https://nation.com.pk/29-Dec-2014/the-forgotten-massacre |website=The Nation |date=29 December 2014|quote=On the same dates [4 and 5 March 1947], Muslim League-led mobs fell with determination and full preparations on the helpless Hindus and Sikhs scattered in the villages of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha.

Around the same time, [[Rigvedic tribes|Indo-Aryan tribes]] moved into the [[Punjab]] from regions further northwest in several [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|waves of migration]].  The resulting [[Vedic Period|Vedic period]] was marked by the composition of the [[Vedas]], large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture, through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, gave rise to [[Hinduism]]. The [[Caste system of India|caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose later during this period. Towards the end of the period, around 600 BCE, after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture,  a second urbanisation took place. The small Indo-Aryan chieftaincies, or [[janapada]]s, were consolidated into larger states, or [[mahajanapadas]]. This urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new [[\u015arama\u1e47a|ascetic]] movements, including [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], which challenged the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion,<ref name=\"Flood 1996 82\"/> and gave rise to new religious concepts.<ref>Flood, Gavin.

This helped the empire flourish and gain power.\n\n====Satavahana Empire====\n{{Main|Satavahana Empire}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n! style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"| Satavahana Empire\n|-\n|\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\">\nSanchi Stupa No.2 Front view1.jpg|[[Sanchi|Sanchi Stupa Two and Southern Gateway]], 1st century CE ([[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]).\nIndian ship on lead coin of Vashishtiputra Shri Pulumavi.jpg|Indian ship on lead coin of [[Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi]], testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the S\u0101tav\u0101hanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE.\n</gallery>\n|-\n|}\nThe \u015a\u0101tav\u0101hanas were based from [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] as well as [[Junnar]] ([[Pune]]) and Prathisthan ([[Paithan]]) in [[Maharashtra]]. The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The S\u0101tav\u0101hanas started out as feudatories to the [[Mauryan dynasty]], but declared independence with its decline.\n\nThe S\u0101tav\u0101hanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) to [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] to the southern tip of India.\n\nThey had to compete with the [[Shunga Empire]] and then the [[Kanva dynasty]] of [[Magadha]] to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the [[Sakas]], [[Yavanas]] and [[Pahlavas]]. In particular, their struggles with the [[Western Kshatrapas]] went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] and [[Sri Yajna S\u0101takarni]] were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the [[Western Kshatrapas]] and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.\n\n====Trade and travels to India====\n{{Further|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}\n[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silk Road]] and [[Spice trade]], ancient trade routes that linked India with the [[Old World]]; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India.

The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern [[Badami]]) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] kingdom of [[Banavasi]] and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of [[Pulakeshin&nbsp;II]]. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of [[South India]] and a golden age in the history of [[Karnataka]].

A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the [[Kaveri]] and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\".

The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of [[Urdu]] was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic [[Prakrit]]s with immigrants speaking [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] under the Muslim rulers. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, [[Razia Sultana]] (1236\u20131240).\n\nDuring the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis between Indian civilization and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. The latter was a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] civilization, with a [[multicultural]] and [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society, and wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks, spanning large parts of [[Afro-Eurasia]], leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp=50\u201352}} However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=re2000>Richard Eaton (2000), [http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/283.extract Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States], Journal of Islamic Studies, 11(3), pp. 283\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of India]] were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate. A major factor in their success was their Turkic [[Mamluk]] slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic [[cavalry]] warfare as the [[Mongols]], as a result of having similar [[nomad]]ic Central Asian roots.

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The hard-fought [[First Anglo-Sikh War|first Anglo-Sikh war]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|second Anglo-Sikh war]] marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.\n\n====Other kingdoms====\nThe [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]] in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of ''treaty of Gajendragad'', in which, Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] took place, where the Mysoreans used the [[Mysorean rockets]]. The [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1798\u20131799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)]].\n\nHyderabad was founded by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] of [[Golconda]] in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad]] in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the [[Battle of Palkhed]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=Bajirao+I#v=onepage&q=Bajirao%20I ''History Modern India'' By S.N.

It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Masulipatnam]] on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and the grant of the rights to establish a factory in [[Surat]] in 1612 by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.  In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara ruler]] farther south, a second factory was established in [[Madras]] on the southeastern coast. [[Bombay]] island, not far from Surat, a former Portuguese outpost gifted to [[Kingdom of England|England]] as [[dowry]] in the marriage of [[Catherine of Braganza]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was leased by the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the Company established a presence on the eastern coast as well; far up that coast, in the [[Ganges River]] delta, a factory was set up in Calcutta. Since, during this time other ''companies''\u2014established by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Danish East India Company|Danish]]\u2014were similarly expanding in the region, the English Company's unremarkable beginnings on [[coastal India]] offered no clues to what would become a lengthy presence on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Company's victory under [[Robert Clive]] in the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]] and another victory in the 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]] (in Bihar), consolidated the Company's power, and forced emperor [[Shah Alam II]] to appoint it the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'', or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and [[Odisha|Orissa]].  The Company thus became the ''de facto'' ruler of large areas of the [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests|lower Gangetic plain]] by 1773.  It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1766\u201399) and the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] (1772\u20131818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the [[Sutlej River]]. With the defeat of the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], no native power represented a threat for the Company any longer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Markovits|2004|pp=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the Company's power chiefly took two forms.  The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions, which collectively came to comprise [[British India]].  The annexed regions included the [[North-Western Provinces]] (comprising [[Rohilkhand]], [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], and the [[Doab]]) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ([[Ahom Kingdom]] 1828), and [[Sindh]] (1843). [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]], and [[Kashmir]], were annexed after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]] in 1849\u201356 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General); however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] (1850) to the [[Dogra Dynasty]] of [[Jammu]], and thereby became a princely state.

The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the [[Enfield rifle]], which was insensitive to local religious prohibition; key mutineer being [[Mangal Pandey]].<ref name=\"Saul David page 70\">Saul David, p. 70, ''The Indian Mutiny'', Penguin Books 2003</ref> In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops, and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], and felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=91}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in [[Meerut]], the rebels very quickly reached [[Delhi]].

The Crown controlled the Company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir).

Under them, India's three big provinces \u2013 [[Maharashtra]], Bengal and [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] shaped the demand of the people and India's nationalism. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British.

The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action.\n\nThe British themselves adopted a \"carrot and stick\" approach in recognition of India's support during the First World War and in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the [[Government of India Act 1919]], which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power.<ref>Albert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine.

The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like [[Non-cooperation movement|non-co-operation]], [[Dandi March|civil disobedience]] and [[Swadeshi movement|economic resistance]]. However, [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]] against the British rule took place throughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the [[Hindustan Republican Association]], founded by [[Chandrasekhar Azad]], [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev Thapar]] and others, that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle.

Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League\u2019s demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27\u201330, 1940 some 1400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a \u2018majority of India\u2019s Muslims\u2019. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition.

The mutinies came to a head with [[The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny|mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy]] in [[Bombay]] in February 1946, followed by others in [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], and [[Karachi]]. The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. Also in early 1946, new elections were called and [[Congress]] candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\n\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end [[United Kingdom|British]] rule of [[India]], and in early 1947 [[United Kingdom|Britain]] announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an [[Interim Government of India|interim government]].\n\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the Indian subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership.\n\nMuslim League leader [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] proclaimed 16 August 1946 as [[Direct Action Day]], with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"[[Direct Action Day|Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946]]\". The communal violence spread to [[Bihar]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), to [[Noakhali]] in Bengal (where Hindus were targeted by Muslims), in [[Garhmukteshwar]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), and on to [[Rawalpindi]] in March 1947 in which Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\n\n====Independence and partition (c. 1947\u2013present)====\n{{Main|Partition of India|History of the Republic of India|History of Pakistan|History of Bangladesh}}\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|width=180 |lines=4\n|File:Brit IndianEmpireReligions3.jpg|A map of the prevailing religions of the British Indian empire based on district-wise majorities based on the Indian census of 1909, and published in the [[Imperial Gazetteer of India]].

During the war, all the subethnic groups of the Yoruba either supported the Ibadan or the Ekiti.

Holman|John Holman]], editor of the ''[[British Philatelic Bulletin]]'', as a \"philatelic writer without equal\"<ref>''Gibbons Stamp Monthly'', October 2007.</ref> but his reputation was damaged by a conviction for theft from the British Museum early in his career, which cost him his job there, and multiple accusations of plagiarism.\n\n== Early life and family ==\nJames Mackay was born in Inverness on 21 November 1936. He was educated in Glasgow, where he also attended the university. Later in life Mackay was awarded a Doctor of Literature (D.Litt.) degree by [[Glasgow University]].\n\nHe married Renate.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/628KAZHYu?url=http://www.gbstamps.com/gbcc/gbcc_mackay_intvw.html \"In The Spotlight\"], Great Britain Collectors Club, 1999.

He became a prolific philatelic author, especially on English, Irish and Scottish [[postmark]]s and also produced popular Postal History Annuals and island series books. He wrote some 200 books and at least 10,000 articles. Mackay's interest in the postal history of St Kilda had been formed during his time stationed there during his army service in the 1950s.\n\n== Theft from the British Museum ==\nIn 1972 Mackay was dismissed from his job as an assistant keeper at the [[British Library Philatelic Collections|British Museum]] in London after he was convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] of stealing valuable proof stamps.<ref>\"Writer in disgrace as book halted by publisher\" Stephen Breen & Catherine Lockerbie, ''The Scotsman''.</ref> He had pleaded guilty to five charges of stealing progressive proofs on loan from the [[Crown Agents Philatelic and Security Printing Archive|Crown Agents]] from the Museum in 1965 and 1966 and was fined \u00a31000.

Through the 1980s he worked on a biography of [[Robert Burns]] which was published in 1992 to favourable reviews and which won the [[Saltire Society Literary Awards|Saltire Society Book of the Year Award]]. Subsequent biographies of [[Allan Pinkerton]] and [[William Wallace]] received more mixed reviews.\n\n1996 saw the release of ''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins: A Life]]'', a work about the life of the famed Irish revolutionary which received excellent reviews.\n\nMackay also wrote books under a number of different pseudonyms, including Ian Angus, William Finlay, Bruce Garden, Alex Matheson and Peter Whittington.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_m.htm Author Pseudonyms]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=phhhHT64kIMC&lpg=PA356&ots=e_uuGTMxxr&dq=stamps%20%22Peter%20Whittington&pg=PA356#v=onepage&q=&f=true International Who's Who of Authors, 2004, p.356]</ref>\n\n==Accusations of plagiarism==\nIn 1998, he published a biography of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It was on the market briefly before [[Robert V. Bruce]] published a damning indictment, detailing sustained [[plagiarism]] of his own work, ''Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude''. Far from being a little-known work, the latter had in fact won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973. The indictment, published in the [[American Historical Association]]'s house journal, counted instances of plagiarism on 80 percent of the pages published. Mackay paid his publishers to withdraw the book from circulation, and Bruce agreed not to sue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |author2=Lyall, Sarah |title=Repeat Accusations Of Plagiarism Taint Prolific Biographer |work=Sunday Book Review |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=21 September 1999 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E0DB1F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>Robert V. Bruce in George Mason University's History News Network http://hnn.us/articles/633.html</ref>\n\nMackay then published a biography of [[John Paul Jones]], the founder of the [[US Navy]]. While initially well received, and the subject of flattering reviews in the trade press, it was soon discovered that it was practically a copy of what those same reviews had marked as the last work on the man, that by [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] in 1942. That biography too had won the Pulitzer. Columbia University history professor [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] was quoted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as saying that the book was \"a spectacular and sustained act of plagiarism.\"<ref>New York Times 25 Sep 1999 \"Publisher Cancels Biography After Plagiarism Inquiry\" [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D8133FF936A1575AC0A96F958260] retrieved on 9  Nov 2007</ref><ref>[[Scotland on Sunday]] \"Muckle \u2019o grief as expert on the bard reviles \u2018plagiarist\u2019\" [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1597732001] retrieved on 9 Nov 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite these accusations, Mackay continued to be commissioned to write articles for the philatelic press, and it has been said that almost the entire text of some editions of ''Stamp & Coin Mart'', a popular British magazine, were written by him.\n\n== Death ==\nMackay died on 12 August 2007 at the age of 70 in Glasgow.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries.cfm?id=1343062007 Prolific writer on philatelic subjects and biographer of Burns] Scotsman.com (retrieved 4 November 2007)</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Philatelic===\n*''St Kilda; Its Posts and Communications'', 1963, 73p.\n*''The Tapling Collection of Postage Stamps and Telegraph Stamps and Postal Stationery'', British Museum, 53 pp, 1964\n*''The World of Stamps:thematic essays on recent new issues'' London: Johnson, 1964, 220p.\n*''Tristan Da Cunha: Its Postal History and Philately'', 72 pp, Mackay & Crabb, 1965\n*''Commonwealth Stamp Design 1840-1965'', British Museum, 32 pp, 1965\n*''Malta - The story of Malta and her stamps'', Philatelic Publishers, 96 pp, 1966, {{ISBN|0-900864-10-9}}\n*''Great Britain: the story of Great Britain and her stamps'' London: Philatelic Publishers, 1967, 158p. \n*''Make Money with Stamps'' by Bruce Garden (pseudonym).

Subsequent biographies of [[Allan Pinkerton]] and [[William Wallace]] received more mixed reviews.\n\n1996 saw the release of ''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins: A Life]]'', a work about the life of the famed Irish revolutionary which received excellent reviews.\n\nMackay also wrote books under a number of different pseudonyms, including Ian Angus, William Finlay, Bruce Garden, Alex Matheson and Peter Whittington.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_m.htm Author Pseudonyms]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=phhhHT64kIMC&lpg=PA356&ots=e_uuGTMxxr&dq=stamps%20%22Peter%20Whittington&pg=PA356#v=onepage&q=&f=true International Who's Who of Authors, 2004, p.356]</ref>\n\n==Accusations of plagiarism==\nIn 1998, he published a biography of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It was on the market briefly before [[Robert V. Bruce]] published a damning indictment, detailing sustained [[plagiarism]] of his own work, ''Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude''. Far from being a little-known work, the latter had in fact won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973. The indictment, published in the [[American Historical Association]]'s house journal, counted instances of plagiarism on 80 percent of the pages published. Mackay paid his publishers to withdraw the book from circulation, and Bruce agreed not to sue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |author2=Lyall, Sarah |title=Repeat Accusations Of Plagiarism Taint Prolific Biographer |work=Sunday Book Review |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=21 September 1999 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E0DB1F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>Robert V.

While initially well received, and the subject of flattering reviews in the trade press, it was soon discovered that it was practically a copy of what those same reviews had marked as the last work on the man, that by [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] in 1942. That biography too had won the Pulitzer. Columbia University history professor [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] was quoted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as saying that the book was \"a spectacular and sustained act of plagiarism.\"<ref>New York Times 25 Sep 1999 \"Publisher Cancels Biography After Plagiarism Inquiry\" [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D8133FF936A1575AC0A96F958260] retrieved on 9  Nov 2007</ref><ref>[[Scotland on Sunday]] \"Muckle \u2019o grief as expert on the bard reviles \u2018plagiarist\u2019\" [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1597732001] retrieved on 9 Nov 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite these accusations, Mackay continued to be commissioned to write articles for the philatelic press, and it has been said that almost the entire text of some editions of ''Stamp & Coin Mart'', a popular British magazine, were written by him.\n\n== Death ==\nMackay died on 12 August 2007 at the age of 70 in Glasgow.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries.cfm?id=1343062007 Prolific writer on philatelic subjects and biographer of Burns] Scotsman.com (retrieved 4 November 2007)</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Philatelic===\n*''St Kilda; Its Posts and Communications'', 1963, 73p.\n*''The Tapling Collection of Postage Stamps and Telegraph Stamps and Postal Stationery'', British Museum, 53 pp, 1964\n*''The World of Stamps:thematic essays on recent new issues'' London: Johnson, 1964, 220p.\n*''Tristan Da Cunha: Its Postal History and Philately'', 72 pp, Mackay & Crabb, 1965\n*''Commonwealth Stamp Design 1840-1965'', British Museum, 32 pp, 1965\n*''Malta - The story of Malta and her stamps'', Philatelic Publishers, 96 pp, 1966, {{ISBN|0-900864-10-9}}\n*''Great Britain: the story of Great Britain and her stamps'' London: Philatelic Publishers, 1967, 158p. \n*''Make Money with Stamps'' by Bruce Garden (pseudonym).

In addition, Blow was a regular participant in the [[Indie Game Jam]]. Blow is also a founding partner of the [[Indie Fund]], an [[angel investor]] fund for independent game projects.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBlow was born in 1971. His mother was a devout ex-nun who constantly reminded her scientifically inclined young son about the imminent return of Jesus. (When Blow's older sister came out as a lesbian in the mid-1980s, their mother disowned her.) Blow's father worked all day for the defense contractor TRW, then came home and spent every possible moment alone in his den, where the children were not welcome. Blow would say in an interview with ''[[The Atlantic]]'', \"Early on, I detected that there weren't good examples at home, so I kind of had to figure things out on my own ... I had to adopt a paradigm of self-sufficiency.\"<ref name=\"The Most Dangerous Gamer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/308928/|title=The Most Dangerous Gamer|accessdate=2018-01-19|date=May 2012|work=The Atlantic}}</ref>\n\nBlow grew up in Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, San Diego, and went to Mt. Carmel High School. He then studied [[computer science]] and [[creative writing]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was president of the [[Computer Science Undergraduate Association]] for a semester.

Blow attempted to get additional funding to turn the demo into a full game from both [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Electronic Arts]] but was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"arstech thewitness\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===''Braid''===\n{{Main|Braid (video game)}}\nIn December 2004, feeling inspired during a trip in Thailand, Blow made a prototype for a time manipulation puzzle platformer game. The demo had crude graphics, but featured the ability of the player to rewind all the objects on screen backwards in time to a previous state. Encouraged by feedback from his peers, Blow worked on the game from about April 2005 to about December that year before having the final prototype of his game, titled ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''. This version won the [[Independent Games Festival]] Game Design Award at the 2006 [[Game Developers Conference]].\n\nHe continued work on the game mostly focusing on art and music while polishing some of the design until its release in 2008 on [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. By then, Blow was $40,000 in debt<ref name=\"The Most Dangerous Gamer\"/> and had invested $200,000 into the game's development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Ellie|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gdc-braid-cost-200k-to-make-says-blow|title=GDC: Braid cost 200k to make, says Blow|website=Eurogamer|date=2009-03-25|accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n\nThe game was released on August 8, 2008, to critical acclaim and achieved financial success, receiving an aggregate score of 93% on [[Metacritic]], making it the top-rated Xbox Live Arcade game.

In addition, Blow was a regular participant in the [[Indie Game Jam]]. Blow is also a founding partner of the [[Indie Fund]], an [[angel investor]] fund for independent game projects.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBlow was born in 1971. His mother was a devout ex-nun who constantly reminded her scientifically inclined young son about the imminent return of Jesus. (When Blow's older sister came out as a lesbian in the mid-1980s, their mother disowned her.) Blow's father worked all day for the defense contractor TRW, then came home and spent every possible moment alone in his den, where the children were not welcome. Blow would say in an interview with ''[[The Atlantic]]'', \"Early on, I detected that there weren't good examples at home, so I kind of had to figure things out on my own ... I had to adopt a paradigm of self-sufficiency.\"<ref name=\"The Most Dangerous Gamer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/308928/|title=The Most Dangerous Gamer|accessdate=2018-01-19|date=May 2012|work=The Atlantic}}</ref>\n\nBlow studied [[computer science]] and [[creative writing]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was president of the [[Computer Science Undergraduate Association]] for a semester.

The demo had crude graphics, but featured the ability of the player to rewind all the objects on screen backwards in time to a previous state. Encouraged by feedback from his peers, Blow worked on the game from about April 2005 to about December that year before having the final prototype of his game, titled ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''. This version won the [[Independent Games Festival]] Game Design Award at the 2006 [[Game Developers Conference]].\n\nHe continued work on the game mostly focusing on art and music while polishing some of the design until its release in 2008 on [[Xbox Live Arcade]].

Later examples show schooners in Amsterdam in 1638 and [[New Amsterdam]] in 1627. Paintings by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|Van de Velde]] (1633-1707) and an engraving by [[Jan Kip]] of the Thames at Lambeth, dated 1697, suggest that schooner rig was common in England and Holland by the end of the 18th century. The ''Royal Transport'' was an example of a large British-built schooner, launched in 1695 at Chatham.<ref name=\"Leather 1970\">{{cite book |last1=Leather |first1=John |title=Gaff Rig |date=1970 |publisher=Adlard Coles Limited |location=London |isbn=0 229 97489 9}}</ref><ref name=\"MacGregor\">{{cite book |last1=MacGregor |first1=David R. |title=Schooners in Four Centuries |date=1982 |publisher=Argus Books Ltd. |location=Hemel Hempstead |isbn=0 85242 774 3}}</ref>\n\nThe type was further developed in [[British North America]] starting around 1713.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web |last1=Wallenfeldt |first1=Jeff |title=Schooner |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/schooner |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref> In the 1700s and 1800s in what is now [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]] schooners became popular for coastal trade, requiring a smaller crew for their size compared to then traditional ocean crossing [[square rig]] ships,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Schooner |short=x}}</ref> and being fast and versatile.<ref name=\"asa\" /> Three-masted schooners were introduced around 1800.<ref name=\"Marquardt\" />\n\nSchooners were popular on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1800s and early 1900s. By 1910, 45 five-masted and 10 six-masted schooners had been built in [[Bath, Maine]] and other [[Penobscot Bay]] towns. The [[Thomas W. Lawson (ship)|''Thomas W. Lawson'']] was the only seven-masted schooner built.\n\nAlthough highly popular in their time, schooners were replaced by more efficient [[sloops]], [[yawl]]s and [[ketch]]es<ref name=\"asa\"/> as sailboats, and in the freight business they were replaced by [[steamship]]s, barges, and railroads.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Coal Schooners |url=https://penobscotmarinemuseum.org/pbho-1/ships-shipbuilding/great-coal-schooners |website=Penobscot Marine Museum |accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Rig types==\nVarious types of schooners are defined by their rig configuration. Most have a [[bowsprit]] although some were built without one for crew safety, such as ''[[Adventure (schooner)|Adventure]]''.\n\nThe following varieties were built:\n[[File:The Petitcodiac River at High Water.jpg|thumb|Tern schooner at dockside {{circa|1910}}. This design is notable for all three masts being of equal height.]]\n* [[Grand Banks]] fishing schooner: similar to ''[[Bluenose]]'', includes a gaff [[topsail]] on the main mast and a [[staysail]]. In the winter this would sail as a two-masted fishing schooner, without and [[topmast]]s and their upper sails.<ref name=\"nsm\">{{cite web |title=Sailing Ship Rigs |url=https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/research/sailing-ship-rigs |website=Maritime Museum of the Atlantic |publisher=Nova Scotia Museum |accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref> Surviving gaff-rigged two-masters include ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'', [[Grace Bailey (schooner)|''Grace Bailey'']], ''[[Roseway]]'', and [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']].\n* Square topsail schooner: includes square topsails.<ref name=\"nsm\"/> A version with raked masts and known for its great speed, called the [[Baltimore Clipper]] was popular in the early 1800s.\n* Four masted schooner: this design spread the sail area over many smaller sails, at a time when sails were hoisted by hand. These were used for coastal trade on the Atlantic coast of North America, the West Indies, South America, and some trans-Atlantic voyages.<ref name=\"nsm\"/>\n* Tern schooner: a three masted schooner very popular between 1880 and 1920.<ref name=\"nsm\"/> [[Wawona (schooner)|''Wawona'']], the largest ever built, sailed on the [[West_Coast_of_the_United_States|West Coast]] from 1897 to 1947.\n\n==Uses==\nSchooners were built primarily for cargo, passengers, and fishing. \n\nThe Norwegian polar schooner ''[[Fram]]'' was used by both [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Roald Amundsen]] in their explorations of the poles.\n\n''Bluenose'' was both a successful fishing boat and a racer. [[America (yacht)|''America'']], eponym of [[America's Cup]], was one of the few schooners ever designed for racing. This race was long dominated by schooners. Three-masted schooner [[Atlantic (yacht)|''Atlantic'']] set the [[transatlantic sailing record]] for a [[monohull]] in the 1905 [[Kaiser's Cup]] race. The record remained unbroken for nearly 100 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/sports/othersports/schooner-breaks-centuryold-record-for-crossing-the.html| title= YACHT RACING; Schooner Breaks Century-Old Record for Crossing the Atlantic  | newspaper= New York Times | first=Nancy | last=Ramsey | date=2005-06-02 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bluenose vs. Gertrude L.

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations.

For the participation of third parties in the public hearing an admission is required (English Accreditation).<ref>{{cite web|title=Zulassung f\u00fcr die Verhandlungen beim Ausschuss|publisher=Hrsg: CCPR|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CAT/Pages/Accreditation.aspx|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/TBSearch.aspx?Lang=en&TreatyID=1&DocTypeID=5|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIf a state fails to file a report despite being warned, the committee examines the implementation of the FoK on the basis of the parallel reports submitted by the NGOs and NHRIs and notes this in its annual report to the UN General Assembly (Rule 67 RMA).\n\nIf the committee determines during the audit that the State has failed to implement the agreement, it may submit proposals to remedy the deficiencies (Article 19 (3) FoK, Rule 71 of the VerfO). These proposals are called Concluding Observations.<ref name=\"ABC_der_Menschenrechte\">{{cite web|title=Rechtliche Instrumente|periodical=ABC der Menschenrechte|publisher=Hrsg: Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Departement f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten, EDA|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/eda/de/documents/publications/GlossarezurAussenpolitik/ABC-Menschenrechte_de.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|pages=10}}</ref>\n\nThese proposals of the CCPR are not legally binding, implementation can not be enforced and only a follow-up procedure is foreseen,<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> in which a rapporteur examines the implementation by the state (Rule 72 RMA).

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations.
