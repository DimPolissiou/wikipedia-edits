It lasted from 5 July to 13 July 1944, and ended with a Soviet victory.\n\nDuring the offensive, Soviet forces encircled and captured the city of [[Vilnius]]; this phase is sometimes referred to as the '''Battle of Vilnius'''. Some three thousand German soldiers of the encircled garrison managed to break out, including their commander, [[Rainer Stahel]].\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter World War I, Vilnius ({{lang-pl|Wilno}}) and the surrounding area were a disputed territory that was part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] ([[Wilno Voivodeship (1926\u20131939)|Wilno Voivodeship]]). During the [[invasion of Poland]], the city was seized by the [[Soviet Union]] and later [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty|transferred to Lithuania]]. It was [[Operation Barbarossa|captured by the Germans]] in June 1941.\n\nFrom 23 June 1944, the Red Army conducted a major offensive operation under the code-name [[Operation Bagration]], expelling the Wehrmacht from [[Belarus]], and driving towards the Polish border and the [[Baltic Sea]] coast.\n\nBy the beginning of July the front line had been torn open at the seam of German [[Army Group Centre]] and [[Army Group North]], roughly on a line from [[Vitebsk]] to Vilnius.  While a large part of the Soviet force was employed to reduce the German pocket east of [[Minsk]], following the [[Minsk Offensive Operation]], the [[STAVKA|Soviet high command]] decided to exploit the situation along the breach to the north, by turning mobile formations towards the major traffic centre of Vilnius, in eastern Lithuania.  For the [[OKW|German high command]], it became imperative to hold Vilnius, because without it would become almost impossible to re-establish a sustainable connection between the two German army groups, and to hold the Red Army off outside [[East Prussia]] and away from the Baltic Sea shores.\n\n''Stavka'' issued a new order, number 220126, to the troops of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] on July 4. This required them to develop their offensive towards [[Maladzyechna]] and Vilnius, capturing the latter no later than 10 July, and to force crossings of the [[Neman River|Neman/Nemunas]] (Russian: ''Niemen'') River. The [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Army]] was transferred from the [[2nd Belorussian Front]] in order to assist these objectives.<ref name=glantzp154>Glantz, p.154</ref>\n\nThe German defenders were still in comparative disarray after the Minsk offensive. Remnants of the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] that had escaped the encirclement, and units of the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]] (reorganised into an ''ad hoc'' ''[[Kampfgruppe]]'', later redesignated XXXIX Panzer Corps, under General [[Dietrich von Saucken]]) fell back to form a defence before Maladzyechna, an important rail junction; but the 5th Guards Tank Army was able to cut the route between there and Minsk on July 3.<ref name=dunnp158>Dunn, p.158</ref>\n\n==Deployments==\n\n===Wehrmacht===\n*Southern flank of [[3rd Panzer Army]] (Colonel-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n**[[XXVI Corps (Germany)|XXVI Corps]] (General [[Gerhard Matzky]])\n**Garrison of Vilnius (Major-General [[Rainer Stahel]]) \n*Remnants of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] (General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]])\n**[[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] (General [[Dietrich von Saucken]])\n**''Sperrgruppe'' [[Helmuth Weidling|Weidling]]\n**[[340th Volksgrenadier Division]] [[Theodor Tolsdorff]]\n\n===Red Army===\n*[[3rd Belorussian Front]] (General [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]])\n**[[11th Guards Army]] (General [[Kuzma Galitsky]])\n**[[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]]\n**[[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Vasily Kryuchenkin]]) \n**[[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Army]]\n**[[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st Army]]\n**[[5th Guards Tank Army]] (General [[Pavel Rotmistrov]])\n**[[1st Air Army (Soviet Union)|1st Air Army]]\n\n==The offensive==\nChernyakhovsky ordered that his main mobile 'exploitation' forces, the 5th Guards Tank Army and [[3rd Guards Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union)|3rd Guards Cavalry Corps]] continue their advance from Minsk on July 5 in the direction of Vilnius, with the aim of reaching the city by the following day: they were to encircle Vilnius from the south and north respectively. The rifle divisions of 5th Army were ordered to follow and close up to them. To the south, the 39th Army was directed to move on [[Lida]], while the 11th Guards Army would advance in the Front's centre.<ref name=glantzp155>Glantz, p.155</ref>\n\nSoviet reports suggested that units on their northern flank advanced to schedule, noting some resistance from scattered remnants of the destroyed [[VI Corps (Germany)|VI Corps]] of Third Panzer Army, but stated that the 11th Guards Army in particular encountered strong German resistance and several counter-attacks. The 5th Panzer Division was, however, unable to hold Maladzyechna. The Soviet 5th Army was able to advance to the outskirts of Vilnius by July 8, while the 5th Guards Tank Army encircled the city from the south, trapping the garrison.<ref name=glantzp158>Glantz, p.158</ref>\n\nLida, another rail junction, was taken by the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps on the evening of July 8, after the German defenders (largely from the notorious [[SS]] units of ''Gruppe'' [[Curt von Gottberg|von Gottberg]] and the [[Kaminski Brigade]]) abandoned their positions in old [[World War I]] trench lines, despite reinforcement from Weidling's units. The latter gave up their attempt to hold the city on July 9.\n\n==The battle for Vilnius==\n[[File:1944-12-22 Russians In New Drive.ogv|thumbtime=1:18|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the battle]] \nDuring the battle for the city itself, the Soviet 5th Army and 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the German garrison of ''Fester Platz'' Vilnius (consisting of Grenadier Regiment 399 and Artillery Regiment 240 of the [[170th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|170th Infantry Division]], Grenadier Regiment 1067, a battalion from the 16th Parachute (''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'') Regiment, the anti-tank battalion of the [[256th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|256th Infantry Division]] and other units) under the command of [[Luftwaffe]] [[Major-General]] [[Rainer Stahel]].\n\nThe Soviet 35th Guards Tank Brigade initially took the airport, defended by the battalion of paratroopers; intense street-by-street fighting then commenced as the Soviets attempted to reduce the defence.<ref name=fallschirmjagers>Official Soviet accounts, and later accounts based on them, speak of a very large number of German troops being parachuted into the city several days into the siege before being wiped out as they landed. German orders of battle do not show such troops. It is possible the accounts are in fact referring to the small number of troops from the 16th Parachute Regiment participating in the defence; other elements of the same unit were present in the relief force.</ref>\n\n===The breakout attempt===\nOn 12 July, the garrison's parent formation, [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]], counter-attacked. [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]], organised into two groups (''P\u00f6ssl'' and ''Stahl'') attacked eastwards from outside the encirclement (the divisional commander and Colonel-General Reinhardt personally accompanied the advance group). The opposing Soviet forces, taken by surprise and hampered by extended lines of supply, were not able to hold the cordon and 6th Panzer's forces were able to advance some 50&nbsp;km to link up with forward elements from the Vilnius garrison. A fierce battle on the banks of the [[Neris river|Neris]] ensued as men of the Polish [[Home Army]] unsuccessfully attempted to stop the relief troops.\n\nIn the city itself, a Soviet attack on the morning of 13 July managed to split the German forces into two pockets centred on the prison and the observatory; around 3,000 Germans escaped through the corridor opened by the 6th Panzer Division before Soviet forces closed the gap. Even so, 12-13,000 German troops were lost in the city, which was finally captured towards the evening of 13 July.<ref name=glantz>Glantz, p.160</ref>\n\nDespite the Soviet forces' success, Rotmistrov's commitment of a tank corps in costly urban fighting (along with earlier disagreements with his Front commander, [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]]) led to his replacement as commander of 5th Guards Tank Army.\n\n===Contribution by the Polish Home Army===\nThe battle was also marked by an uprising under the code-name [[Operation Ostra Brama]] by the Polish Home Army, in expectation of the arrival of the Red Army, as part of [[Operation Tempest]]. The accounts of the battle given by the Home Army differ from the official Soviet account, particularly with regard to the date of Soviet entry into Vilnius.\n\n==Outcome==\nWhile the German aim of holding Vilnius as a ''Fester Platz'' or fortress was not achieved, the tenacious defence made a contribution in stopping the Red Army's drive west for a few precious days: most importantly, it tied down the 5th Guards Tank Army, which had been instrumental in the initial successes of the Red Army during Operation Bagration. This delay gave German forces a chance to re-establish something resembling a continuous defence line further to the west. Hitler recognised this achievement by awarding Stahel the 79th set of Swords to the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] awarded during the war.  Nevertheless, the outcome fell far short of what the German command had hoped for, and the continuous frontline that was established only held for a short time.  Without the traffic network based on Vilnius, the German position in the southern Baltics was untenable. By the end of July, the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] was ordered to conduct the [[Kaunas Offensive Operation]] to further extend the gains of Operation Bagration.\n\nMost of the few remaining Jewish residents of Vilnius, who had been afforded some measure of protection in the [[HKP 562 forced labor camp]] by the actions of a ''Wehrmacht'' officer, [[Karl Plagge]], were murdered by the [[SS]] as Soviet forces approached the city. Plagge was however able to issue a coded warning which resulted in around 250 lives being saved.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Operation Bagration]], the strategic offensive of which this action was a part\n*[[Karl Plagge]]\n*[[Roza Shanina]], Soviet sniper who fought in the battle for Vilnius\n*[[Theodor Tolsdorff]], German officer decorated for his role in the battle\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|url=|title=Soviet Blitzkrieg: The Battle for White Russia, 1944|last=Dunn|first=Walter S.|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-1-5558-7880-1|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=}}\n* {{cite book| editor-last=Glantz|editor-first=David M.|editor2-last = Orenstein|editor2-first=Harold S.|title=Belorussia 1944: The Soviet General Staff Study|publisher= Routledge|year=2001|ISBN= 0714651028  }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.historynet.com/operation-bagration-soviet-offensive-of-1944.htm Operation Bagration: Soviet offensive of 1944] historynet 7/25/2006\n\n{{Subject bar\n| portal1=Military of Germany\n| portal2=Germany|portal20=Politics| portal3=Soviet Union\n| portal4=World War II\n}}\n\n[[Category:Battles involving the Soviet Union|Vilnius]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1944]]\n[[Category:Operation Bagration]]\n[[Category:1944 in Lithuania]]\n[[Category:History of Vilnius]]\n[[Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany]]\n[[Category:Strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Lithuania in World War II]]\n[[Category:July 1944 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the 1944 battle for Vilnius between the Red Army and the Wehrmacht|combat between the Polish Home Army and the Wehrmacht|Operation Ostra Brama|the 1919 battle|Vilna offensive}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Vilnius Offensive\n|partof= [[Operation Bagration]] / [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date= July 1944\n|place=[[Belarus]] ([[Minsk Region]]) and [[Lithuania]] ([[Vilnius Region]] and [[Alytus Region]])\n|coordinates= {{coord|54|40|N|25|15|E|region:LT_type:event|display=inline,title}}\n|result= Soviet victory\n|combatant1={{flag|Soviet Union|1936}}\n|combatant2={{flagcountry|Nazi Germany}}\n|combatant3={{flagicon|Poland}} Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]]\n|commander1={{flagicon|USSR|1936}} [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]]<br />{{flagicon|USSR|1936}} [[Pavel Rotmistrov]]\n|commander2={{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Walter Model]]<br />{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Dietrich von Saucken]]<br />{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Rainer Stahel]]<br />{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Theodor Tolsdorff]]\n|commander3={{flagicon|Poland}} [[Aleksander Krzy\u017canowski]]<br />{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Antoni Olechnowicz]]\n|strength1=~100,000\n|strength2=7,700\n|strength3=4,200\n|strength4=?\n|casualties1=50-70 tanks\n?\n|casualties2=8,000 killed; 5,000 captured in Vilnius alone (Soviet est)\n|casualties3=500\n|casualties4=?\n|notes=\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Axis-Soviet War}}  \n{{Campaignbox Leningrad and Baltics 1941-1944}}\n{{Campaignbox Poland 1944-1945}}\n\nThe '''Vilnius Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|\u0412\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044e\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f}}) occurred as part of the third phase of [[Operation Bagration]], the great summer offensive by the [[Red Army]] against the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in June and July, 1944.

For the most part, state Republican parties did not change their name.<ref>[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], ed. ''History of U.S. Political Parties: vol II: 1860\u20131910''  (1973) 2:1287.</ref> The temporary name was used to attract [[War Democrat]]s and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]], [[Unconditional Union Party|Unconditional Unionists]] and [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]] members  who would not vote for the Republican Party. The party nominated incumbent Republican [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and for Democrat [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], who were elected in an electoral [[Landslide victory|landslide]].\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe National Union Party was created prior to the General Election of November 1864, when the Civil War was still in progress. A faction of anti-Lincoln [[Radical Republican]]s held the belief that Lincoln was incompetent and therefore could not be reelected. A number of Radical Republicans formed a party called the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]] and a few hundred delegates met in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] starting on May 31, 1864, eventually nominating [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], who had also been the Republicans' first presidential standard-bearer during the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].\n\n=== Baltimore Convention ===\nRepublicans loyal to Lincoln created a new name for their party in convention at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] during the first week in June 1864 in order to accommodate the [[War Democrat]]s who supported the war and wished to separate themselves from the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]. This is the main reason why War Democrat [[Andrew Johnson]] was selected to be the vice presidential nominee as then-current Vice President [[Hannibal Hamlin]] was not nominated. The National Unionists supporting the Lincoln\u2013Johnson ticket also hoped that the new party would stress the national character of the war.\n\nThe convention's temporary chairman, [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge]] of Kentucky, explained that he could support Lincoln on this new ticket for the following reason:<ref>[[John G. Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]], ''Abraham Lincoln: A History'' (1890) 9:66.</ref> {{cquote|As a Union party I will follow you to the ends of the earth, and to the gates of death. But as an Abolition party, as a Republican party, as a Whig party, as a Democratic party, as an American [Know-Nothing] party, I will not follow you one foot.}}\n\nThe National Union Party adopted the following goals as its platform: {{cquote|[P]ursuit of the war until the Confederacy surrendered unconditionally; a constitutional amendment for the abolition of slavery; aid to disabled Union veterans; continued European neutrality; enforcement of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]; encouragement of immigration; and construction of a transcontinental railroad. It also praised the use of black troops and Lincoln's management of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1864/Overview-1864-2.htm#Convention|title=HarpWeek &#124; Elections &#124; 1864 Overview|publisher=Elections.harpweek.com|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|1864 National Union Party presidential nominee, [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Andrew Johnson photo portrait head and shoulders, c1870-1880-Edit1.jpg|thumb|1864 National Union Party vice presidential nominee, [[Andrew Johnson]]]]\nNews of his nomination at the [[1864 Republican National Convention|1864 National Union Convention]] elicited Lincoln's famous response on June 9, 1864: {{cquote|I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me, both by the convention and by the National [Union] League. I am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this; yet I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment. The convention and the nation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for the present and the great future, and that part I am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I am not entirely unworthy to be entrusted with the place I have occupied for the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded, in this connection, of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once that 'it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams.'}}\n\nIn August 1864, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that should he lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House:<ref>[[Mark Grimsley]] and [[Brooks D. Simpson]], eds. ''The Collapse of the Confederacy'' (2001) p. 80.</ref> {{cquote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected.

''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (1953), vol. 7, p. 514.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.\n\n== Changing mood ==\nThe complexion of the war changed as the election approached. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate Commander]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s last victory in battle occurred June 3, 1864 at [[Cold Harbor]]. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s aggressive tactics trapped Lee in the trenches defending Richmond. Admiral [[David Farragut]] successfully shut down Mobile Bay as a Confederate resource in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] on August 3\u201323, 1864. Most decisive of all, Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] captured Atlanta on September 1, 1864, convincing even the pessimists that the Confederacy was collapsing.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]], ''War for the Union'' 4:97\u201398, 120\u2013122.</ref>\n\n== Fr\u00e9mont withdraws ==\nFr\u00e9mont and his fellow Republicans hated their former ally [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Montgomery Blair]]. Fr\u00e9mont, aware that his candidacy could result in victory for the Democrats, made a deal to drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Blair's removal from office. On September 22, 1864, Fr\u00e9mont dropped out of the race. On September 23, Lincoln asked for and received Blair's resignation. The National Union ticket went on to win handily in the [[1864 United States presidential election|election of 1864]], defeating the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket of General [[George B.

For the most part, state Republican parties did not change their name.<ref>[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], ed. ''History of U.S. Political Parties: vol II: 1860\u20131910''  (1973) 2:1287.</ref> The temporary name was used to attract [[War Democrat]]s and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]], [[Unconditional Union Party|Unconditional Unionists]] and [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]] members  who would not vote for the Republican Party. The party nominated incumbent Republican [[List of presidents of the United States |President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and for Democrat [[List of vice presidents of the United States |Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], who were elected in an electoral [[Landslide victory|landslide]].\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe National Union Party was created prior to the General Election of November 1864, when the Civil War was still in progress. A faction of anti-Lincoln [[Radical Republican]]s held the belief that Lincoln was incompetent and therefore could not be reelected. A number of Radical Republicans formed a party called the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]] and a few hundred delegates met in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] starting on May 31, 1864, eventually nominating [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], who had also been the Republicans' first presidential standard-bearer during the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].\n\n=== Baltimore Convention ===\nRepublicans loyal to Lincoln created a new name for their party in convention at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] during the first week in June 1864 in order to accommodate the [[War Democrat]]s who supported the war and wished to separate themselves from the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]. This is the main reason why War Democrat [[Andrew Johnson]] was selected to be the vice presidential nominee as then-current Vice President [[Hannibal Hamlin]] was not nominated. The National Unionists supporting the Lincoln\u2013Johnson ticket also hoped that the new party would stress the national character of the war.\n\nThe convention's temporary chairman, [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge]] of Kentucky, explained that he could support Lincoln on this new ticket for the following reason:<ref>[[John G. Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]], ''Abraham Lincoln: A History'' (1890) 9:66.</ref> {{cquote|As a Union party I will follow you to the ends of the earth, and to the gates of death. But as an Abolition party, as a Republican party, as a Whig party, as a Democratic party, as an American [Know-Nothing] party, I will not follow you one foot.}}\n\nThe National Union Party adopted the following goals as its platform: {{cquote|[P]ursuit of the war until the Confederacy surrendered unconditionally; a constitutional amendment for the abolition of slavery; aid to disabled Union veterans; continued European neutrality; enforcement of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]; encouragement of immigration; and construction of a transcontinental railroad. It also praised the use of black troops and Lincoln's management of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1864/Overview-1864-2.htm#Convention|title=HarpWeek &#124; Elections &#124; 1864 Overview|publisher=Elections.harpweek.com|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|1864 National Union Party presidential nominee, [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Andrew Johnson photo portrait head and shoulders, c1870-1880-Edit1.jpg|thumb|1864 National Union Party vice presidential nominee, [[Andrew Johnson]]]]\nNews of his nomination at the [[1864 Republican National Convention|1864 National Union Convention]] elicited Lincoln's famous response on June 9, 1864: {{cquote|I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me, both by the convention and by the National [Union] League. I am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this; yet I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment. The convention and the nation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for the present and the great future, and that part I am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I am not entirely unworthy to be entrusted with the place I have occupied for the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded, in this connection, of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once that 'it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams.'}}\n\nIn August 1864, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that should he lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House:<ref>[[Mark Grimsley]] and [[Brooks D. Simpson]], eds. ''The Collapse of the Confederacy'' (2001) p. 80.</ref> {{cquote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the [[inauguration]]; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.<ref>Lincoln, Memorandum concerning his probable failure of re-election, August 23, 1864. ''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (1953), vol. 7, p. 514.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.\n\n== Changing mood ==\nThe complexion of the war changed as the election approached. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate Commander]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s last victory in battle occurred June 3, 1864 at [[Cold Harbor]]. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s aggressive tactics trapped Lee in the trenches defending Richmond. Admiral [[David Farragut]] successfully shut down Mobile Bay as a Confederate resource in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] on August 3\u201323, 1864. Most decisive of all, Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] captured Atlanta on September 1, 1864, convincing even the pessimists that the Confederacy was collapsing.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]], ''War for the Union'' 4:97\u201398, 120\u2013122.</ref>\n\n== Fr\u00e9mont withdraws ==\nFr\u00e9mont and his fellow Republicans hated their former ally [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Montgomery Blair]]. Fr\u00e9mont, aware that his candidacy could result in victory for the Democrats, made a deal to drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Blair's removal from office. On September 22, 1864, Fr\u00e9mont dropped out of the race. On September 23, Lincoln asked for and received Blair's resignation. The National Union ticket went on to win handily in the [[1864 United States presidential election|election of 1864]], defeating the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket of General [[George B.

The Allies believed if they moved quickly, before the newly arrived Axis forces were fully organised, they would still be able to capture the capital Tunis at relatively little cost. The plan called for the Allies to advance along the two roads and take [[Bizerte]] and [[Tunis]]. Once Bizerte was taken Torch would come to an end. Attacking in the north towards Bizerte would be the British [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Brigade]], supported by Hart Force, a small armoured group from the British 6th Armoured Division.\n\nTo the south, the British [[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East|11th Infantry Brigade]] supported on their left by 'Blade Force', an armoured regimental group commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Richard Hull]], which included the tanks of the [[17th/21st Lancers|17/21st Lancers]] of the 26th Armoured Brigade, a US light tank battalion plus motorised infantry, paratroops, artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns and engineers.<ref>Ford (1999), p.15</ref><ref>Watson (2007), p.61</ref> Both infantry brigades were from the British [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th (Battleaxe) Infantry Division]], whose commander, Major-General [[Vyvyan Evelegh]], was in command of the offensive. (Evelegh was later to command the 6th Armoured Division.) The operation narrowly failed with the modest attacking forces getting to within {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of Tunis before the Axis troops, which had mainly been flown in, were able to organise their defences and stop the Allied advance. By the end of 1942, a stalemate had set in as both sides built up their forces.\n\n===Kasserine===\n{{Main|Battle of Kasserine Pass}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Tunisia 1943 NA500.jpg|thumb|[[Crusader tank|Crusader III tank]] of the [[17th/21st Lancers]] on a road near Bou Arada, Tunisia, 13 January 1943.]]\nOn 30 January 1943, the German [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] (veterans of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' under ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]) and three Italian divisions met elements of the French forces near Fa\u00efd, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. The French were overrun and two US units near them were surrounded. Several counter-attacks were organised, including a number by the US [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] but these were beaten off with ease. After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior, to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of [[Sbeitla]].\n\nThe Germans and Italians started forward once again the following week to take Sbeitla. They were held up for two days but eventually the defence started to collapse on the night of 16 February 1943 and the town lay empty by midday on 17 February (see also the [[Battle of Sidi Bou Zid]]). The entirety of the interior plains in Axis hands and the remaining Allied forces retreated further, to the two passes on the western arm of the mountains into Algeria, at Sbiba and Kasserine. It was during this time that the 38th (Irish) Brigade left the division, to be replaced by the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]] from the 78th (Battleaxe) Division.\n\nThe Axis offensive stopped, even as the US [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] ([[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Lloyd Fredendall]]) retreated in disarray. Eventually Rommel decided his next course of action was to simply take the American supplies on the Algerian side of the western arm of the mountains. Although doing little for his own situation, it would seriously upset any possible American actions from that direction.\n\n[[File:German POWs help carry a wounded British soldier during 6th Armoured Division's attack on the town of Pichon in Tunisia, 8 April 1943. NA1880.jpg|thumb|German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) carry a wounded British soldier during the 6th Armoured Division's attack on the town of Pichon in Tunisia, 8 April 1943.]]\nOn 19 February 1943, Rommel launched what would become the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]]. After two days of advances through the American defences, the ''Afrika Korps'' and the Italians had suffered few casualties, while the American forces lost 16,000 men and two-thirds of their tanks. During the battle the Italian [[131st Armoured Division Centauro|131st ''Centauro'' Armoured Division]] captured more than 3,000 American soldiers. On the night of 21 February 1943, the 6th Armoured and [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Divisions]], arrived to bolster the American defence, having been pulled from the British lines facing the Germans at Sbiba. Counter-attacks by Italian troops were also ordered on the British and Americans. Two battalions of experienced Bersaglieri soldiers are recorded by the 23rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery as having made a daylight counter-attack through the Ousseltia Plain, which was repelled.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/97/a4144097.shtml BBC Peoples War website]</ref> Next day opened with another German counter-attack against the Americans, until the arrival of four US artillery battalions made offensive operations difficult.\n\nFaced with stiffening defences and the news that the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] had reached [[Medenine]], only a few kilometres from the [[Mareth Line]], Rommel decided to call off the attack and withdraw on the night of 22 February 1943 to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west for the moment. The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February. It was after the battle of Kasserine Pass that the 6th Armoured Division was reorganised and equipped with the [[M4 Sherman]] tank. In March 1943 the division was assigned to the recently arrived [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] (Lieutenant-General John Crocker) the former first GOC of the division, who was later wounded in a training accident and replaced by Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]. The division was the spearhead of the final assault by the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] in May 1943, breaking through to Tunis. The 6th Armoured Division went on to take the surrender of the famous [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] and participated in the round up and capitulation of all Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943.\n\n===Italy===\nItaly was to prove different from North Africa. There was no more mobile warfare in wide open spaces. The division would spend much of its time supporting the infantry as the Allies came across defensive line after defensive line.\n\n===Cassino===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Monte Cassino''' (also known as the '''Battle for Rome''' and the '''Battle for Cassino''') was a costly series of four battles. In the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Gustav Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido, Liri and Garigliano valleys and certain surrounding peaks and ridges. The venerable abbey of [[Monte Cassino]], founded in [[Anno domini|AD]] 524 by [[St. Benedict]] was not occupied, although the Germans manned defensive positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey walls. On 15 February the monastery, high on a peak overlooking the town of [[Cassino (FR)|Cassino]], was destroyed by American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], [[B-25]] and [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bombers. The bombing was based on the fear that the abbey was being used as a lookout post for the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] defenders (this position evolved over time to admit that Axis military was not garrisoned there). Two days after the bombing, ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroopers) poured into the ruins to defend it. From 17 January to 18 May, the Gustav defences were assaulted four times by Allied troops. These operations resulted in casualties of over 54,000 Allied and 20,000 German soldiers.\n\n===Operation Diadem===\n{{Main|Operation Diadem}}\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15052.jpg|thumb|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun of 12th Royal Horse Artillery (Honourable Artillery Company), 6th Armoured Division, 17 May 1944.]]\nOperation Diadem was the final battle at Cassino, during which the Division was a part of the British [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant General [[Sidney Kirkman]]). The plan was that the [[II Corps (United States)|US II Corps]] on the left would attack up the coast along the line of Route 7 towards Rome. The French Corps on its right would attack from the bridgehead across the Garigliano originally created by X Corps in the first battle in January into the [[Aurunci Mountains]], which formed a barrier between the coastal plain and the Liri Valley; XIII Corps in the centre right of the front would attack along the Liri valley, whilst, on the right, the 2nd Polish Corps would attempt to isolate the monastery and push round behind it into the Liri valley to link with the XIII Corps thrust and pinch out the Cassino position. The division took part in the advance north through central Italy under command variously of XIII Corps and [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]].\n\n===Gothic Line===\n{{Main|Gothic Line}}\n\nThe next major engagements were along the [[Gothic Line]] defences. The 6th Armoured Division, now under Major General [[Gerald Templer]] (replaced by Major General [[Horatius Murray]] after Templer was injured in early August), was now part of XIII Corps, which had been assigned to the US [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] ([[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]]) to form its right flank and fight in the high [[Apennine Mountains]] during Operation Olive in August and September 1944. The Gothic Line, also known as Linea Gotica, formed ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]]'s last major line of defence in the final stages of the [[Second World War]] during the fighting retreat of the German forces in Italy. The 6th Armoured Division captured the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forl\u00ec on 18 September.\n\n===Spring 1945 Offensive===\n{{Main|Spring 1945 offensive in Italy}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18585.jpg|thumb|A Sherman and Stuart reconnaissance tank of the [[Lothian and Border Horse|2nd Lothian and Border Horse]], part of the 6th Armoured Division, near Rufina, Italy, 12 September 1944.]]\nIn the fertile plains of Northern Italy, the mountains gave way to ditches, canals and flood banks. As the wet winter weather, which had turned the rivers into torrents and swamped the ground receded, the Fifth and Eighth Armies were able to launch their final offensive in Italy in March 1945. The 6th Armoured Division had re-joined the Eighth Army as part of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]]. On the right wing of the armies, V Corps attacked across the Senio river and then the Santerno river. Elements of the [[56th (London) Infantry Division]] and the 78th (Battleaxe) Infantry Division then drove on towards the town of Argenta where the dry land narrowed to a front of only {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} bounded on the right by Lake Comacchio, a huge lagoon running to the Adriatic coast and on the left by marshland. By 19 April, the Argenta Gap had been forced and 6th Armoured was released through the left wing of the advancing 78th Division, to swing left to race north west along the line of the river Reno to Bondeno and link up with units of the Fifth Army advancing north from west of Bologna, to complete the encirclement of the German divisions defending Bologna. On all fronts the German defence continued to be determined and effective but Bondeno was captured on 23 April. The 6th Armoured Division linked with the [[10th Mountain Division]] (US [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]]) the next day at Finale. The IV Corps had broken through onto the plains on 19 April, bypassing Bologna on their right. Bologna was entered by the Poles advancing up the line of Route 9 on 21 April, followed two hours later by the US II Corps from the south.\n\nIV Corps had continued its northwards advance and reached the river Po at [[San Benedetto Po|San Benedetto]] on 22 April. The river was crossed the next day and it advanced north to [[Verona]], which was entered on 26 April. XIII Corps crossed the Po at [[Ficarolo]] on 22 April, while further east V Corps was crossing the Po by 25 April, heading towards the [[Venetian Line]], a defensive line built behind the line of the river Adige. V Corps, met by lessening resistance, traversed the Venetian Line and entered [[Padua]] in the early hours of 29 April, to find that partisans had locked up the German garrison of 5,000 men.<ref>Blaxland, p. 277</ref> As April came to an end, Army Group C, the Axis forces in Italy, retreating on all fronts and having lost most of its fighting powers, was left with little option but to surrender. General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]], who had taken command of the army group sent a representative to sign the instrument of surrender on behalf of the German armies in Italy on 29 April, formally bringing hostilities in Italy to an end on 2 May 1945.\n\n==Post war==\nThe Division was reformed in May 1951 in the UK and later assigned to the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in Germany. It consisted of the [[British 20th Armoured Brigade|20th Armoured Brigade]] and 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade. It was disbanded in June 1958.\n\n==General Officer Commanding==\n\nCommanders included:<ref>[http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf Army Comnmands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211343/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |date=5 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{|width=\"600\"\n|'''Appointed'''\n|'''General Officer Commanding'''\n|-\n|27 September 1940\n|[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[John Crocker]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\">Joslen, p. 17</ref>\n|-\n|9 January 1941\n|[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Evelyn Fanshawe]] (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|22 February 1941\n|Major-General John Crocker<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|15 October 1941\n|Major-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|29 October 1941\n|Major-General [[Charles Gairdner]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 May 1942\n|Major-General [[Charles Keightley]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 December 1943\n|Major-General [[Vyvyan Evelegh]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|15 February 1944\n|Brigadier William Edward Gordon Hemming (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 March 1944\n|Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|24 July 1944\n|Major-General [[Gerald Templer]] (wounded 5 August 1944)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|5 August 1944\n|Brigadier C.A.M.D. Scott (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|13 August 1944\n|Brigadier [[Francis Mitchell (British Army officer)|Francis Mitchell]] (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|21 August 1944\n|Major-General [[Horatius Murray]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|27 July 1945\n|Brigadier [[Adrian Clements Gore]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|}\n<br />\n{|width=\"600\"\n|'''Appointed'''\n|'''General Officer Commanding'''\n|-\n|1951\n|Major-General [[George Erroll Prior-Palmer|George Prior-Palmer]]<ref>'PRIOR-PALMER, Maj.-Gen.

(military)|division]] of the [[British Army]], created in September 1940 during the [[Second World War]]. In October 1940, armoured regiments within the Division, such as the 2nd Lothian and Border Horse, were supplied with [[Matilda II|Matilda]] MkI.I tanks, then in May 1942 Crusader MkII tanks, in August 1942 [[Valentine tank|Valentine Mk.V tank]]s and finally in October [[Crusader tank|Crusader MKIII]]s. In North Africa tankers were finally put on an almost equal footing to their Panzer counterparts when the [[M4 Sherman|M4A2 Sherman]] medium tank was added to their inventory by March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishcavalry/17th21stlancers1923.htm| title=17th/21st Lancers| work=BritishEmpire.co.uk website}}</ref> In November/December 1942 The division participated in the [[Operation Torch]] assault landings in Bone, closest to the Axis Forces in all the Torch landings that stretched from Morocco to the Tunisian border. In November 1942 they saw their first action as part of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] of the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]], First Allied Army in the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. In March 1943, around the same time when most of the units had been supplied with American M4A2 Shermans, the Sixth Division came under IX Corp. After Tunisia, the Division participated in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] as part of the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] and ended the war in Austria, again under the command of V Corps.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H13892.jpg|thumb|left|15-cwt trucks, carriers and motorcycles of a motor battalion in 6th Armoured Division, lined up for an inspection by the King near Brandon in Suffolk, 12 September 1941.]]\n\nThe division was formed in the United Kingdom under [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]] on 12 September 1940, commanded by [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[John Crocker]], an officer of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] who had recently fought in the [[Battle of France]]. The division initially had the [[20th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th]] and [[26th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|26th Armoured Brigades]] under command, as well as the [[6th Support Group (United Kingdom)|6th Support Group]]. In late April 1942, the 20th Armoured Brigade was transferred from the division and replaced by the [[38th (Irish) Brigade|38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade]] and the 6th Support Group was disbanded in June. The 6th Armoured Division, now commanded by Major General [[Charles Keightley]], taking over from Major General [[Charles Gairdner]], soon began intensive training in preparation for service overseas.\n\n===North Africa===\n{{Main|Operation Torch|Run for Tunis|Tunisian Campaign}}\n\nOperation Torch (initially called Operation Gymnast) was the joint Anglo-American invasion of [[French North Africa]] during the Second World War in the [[North African Campaign]], starting on 8 November 1942. On 22 November, the [[North African Agreement]] finally placed [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] North Africa on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], allowing the Allied garrison troops to be sent forward to the front. By this time the [[Axis powers]] had been able to build up their forces and outnumber the Allies. The Allies had only two [[brigade group]]s, one of which was the 26th Armoured Brigade, and some additional armour and artillery for an attack on [[Tunisia]]. The Allies believed if they moved quickly, before the newly arrived Axis forces were fully organised, they would still be able to capture the capital Tunis at relatively little cost. The plan called for the Allies to advance along the two roads and take [[Bizerte]] and [[Tunis]]. Once Bizerte was taken Torch would come to an end. Attacking in the north towards Bizerte would be the British [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Brigade]], supported by Hart Force, a small armoured group from the British 6th Armoured Division.\n\nTo the south, the British [[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East|11th Infantry Brigade]] supported on their left by 'Blade Force', an armoured regimental group commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Richard Hull]], which included the tanks of the [[17th/21st Lancers|17/21st Lancers]] of the 26th Armoured Brigade, a US light tank battalion plus motorised infantry, paratroops, artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns and engineers.<ref>Ford (1999), p.15</ref><ref>Watson (2007), p.61</ref> Both infantry brigades were from the British [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th (Battleaxe) Infantry Division]], whose commander, Major-General [[Vyvyan Evelegh]], was in command of the offensive. (Evelegh was later to command the 6th Armoured Division.) The operation narrowly failed with the modest attacking forces getting to within {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of Tunis before the Axis troops, which had mainly been flown in, were able to organise their defences and stop the Allied advance. By the end of 1942, a stalemate had set in as both sides built up their forces.\n\n===Kasserine===\n{{Main|Battle of Kasserine Pass}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Tunisia 1943 NA500.jpg|thumb|[[Crusader tank|Crusader III tank]] of the [[17th/21st Lancers]] on a road near Bou Arada, Tunisia, 13 January 1943.]]\nOn 30 January 1943, the German [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] (veterans of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' under ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]) and three Italian divisions met elements of the French forces near Fa\u00efd, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. The French were overrun and two US units near them were surrounded. Several counter-attacks were organised, including a number by the US [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] but these were beaten off with ease. After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior, to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of [[Sbeitla]].\n\nThe Germans and Italians started forward once again the following week to take Sbeitla. They were held up for two days but eventually the defence started to collapse on the night of 16 February 1943 and the town lay empty by midday on 17 February (see also the [[Battle of Sidi Bou Zid]]). The entirety of the interior plains in Axis hands and the remaining Allied forces retreated further, to the two passes on the western arm of the mountains into Algeria, at Sbiba and Kasserine. It was during this time that the 38th (Irish) Brigade left the division, to be replaced by the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]] from the 78th (Battleaxe) Division.\n\nThe Axis offensive stopped, even as the US [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] ([[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Lloyd Fredendall]]) retreated in disarray. Eventually Rommel decided his next course of action was to simply take the American supplies on the Algerian side of the western arm of the mountains. Although doing little for his own situation, it would seriously upset any possible American actions from that direction.\n\n[[File:German POWs help carry a wounded British soldier during 6th Armoured Division's attack on the town of Pichon in Tunisia, 8 April 1943. NA1880.jpg|thumb|German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) carry a wounded British soldier during the 6th Armoured Division's attack on the town of Pichon in Tunisia, 8 April 1943.]]\nOn 19 February 1943, Rommel launched what would become the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]]. After two days of advances through the American defences, the ''Afrika Korps'' and the Italians had suffered few casualties, while the American forces lost 16,000 men and two-thirds of their tanks. During the battle the Italian [[131st Armoured Division Centauro|131st ''Centauro'' Armoured Division]] captured more than 3,000 American soldiers. On the night of 21 February 1943, the 6th Armoured and [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Divisions]], arrived to bolster the American defence, having been pulled from the British lines facing the Germans at Sbiba. Counter-attacks by Italian troops were also ordered on the British and Americans. Two battalions of experienced Bersaglieri soldiers are recorded by the 23rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery as having made a daylight counter-attack through the Ousseltia Plain, which was repelled.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/97/a4144097.shtml BBC Peoples War website]</ref> Next day opened with another German counter-attack against the Americans, until the arrival of four US artillery battalions made offensive operations difficult.\n\nFaced with stiffening defences and the news that the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] had reached [[Medenine]], only a few kilometres from the [[Mareth Line]], Rommel decided to call off the attack and withdraw on the night of 22 February 1943 to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west for the moment. The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February. It was after the battle of Kasserine Pass that the 6th Armoured Division was reorganised and equipped with the [[M4 Sherman]] tank. In March 1943 the division was assigned to the recently arrived [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] (Lieutenant-General John Crocker) the former first GOC of the division, who was later wounded in a training accident and replaced by Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]. The division was the spearhead of the final assault by the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] in May 1943, breaking through to Tunis. The 6th Armoured Division went on to take the surrender of the famous [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] and participated in the round up and capitulation of all Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943.\n\n===Italy===\nItaly was to prove different from North Africa. There was no more mobile warfare in wide open spaces. The division would spend much of its time supporting the infantry as the Allies came across defensive line after defensive line.\n\n===Cassino===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Monte Cassino''' (also known as the '''Battle for Rome''' and the '''Battle for Cassino''') was a costly series of four battles. In the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Gustav Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido, Liri and Garigliano valleys and certain surrounding peaks and ridges. The venerable abbey of [[Monte Cassino]], founded in [[Anno domini|AD]] 524 by [[St. Benedict]] was not occupied, although the Germans manned defensive positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey walls. On 15 February the monastery, high on a peak overlooking the town of [[Cassino (FR)|Cassino]], was destroyed by American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], [[B-25]] and [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bombers. The bombing was based on the fear that the abbey was being used as a lookout post for the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] defenders (this position evolved over time to admit that Axis military was not garrisoned there). Two days after the bombing, ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroopers) poured into the ruins to defend it. From 17 January to 18 May, the Gustav defences were assaulted four times by Allied troops. These operations resulted in casualties of over 54,000 Allied and 20,000 German soldiers.\n\n===Operation Diadem===\n{{Main|Operation Diadem}}\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15052.jpg|thumb|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun of 12th Royal Horse Artillery (Honourable Artillery Company), 6th Armoured Division, 17 May 1944.]]\nOperation Diadem was the final battle at Cassino, during which the Division was a part of the British [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant General [[Sidney Kirkman]]). The plan was that the [[II Corps (United States)|US II Corps]] on the left would attack up the coast along the line of Route 7 towards Rome. The French Corps on its right would attack from the bridgehead across the Garigliano originally created by X Corps in the first battle in January into the [[Aurunci Mountains]], which formed a barrier between the coastal plain and the Liri Valley; XIII Corps in the centre right of the front would attack along the Liri valley, whilst, on the right, the 2nd Polish Corps would attempt to isolate the monastery and push round behind it into the Liri valley to link with the XIII Corps thrust and pinch out the Cassino position. The division took part in the advance north through central Italy under command variously of XIII Corps and [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]].\n\n===Gothic Line===\n{{Main|Gothic Line}}\n\nThe next major engagements were along the [[Gothic Line]] defences. The 6th Armoured Division, now under Major General [[Gerald Templer]] (replaced by Major General [[Horatius Murray]] after Templer was injured in early August), was now part of XIII Corps, which had been assigned to the US [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] ([[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]]) to form its right flank and fight in the high [[Apennine Mountains]] during Operation Olive in August and September 1944. The Gothic Line, also known as Linea Gotica, formed ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]]'s last major line of defence in the final stages of the [[Second World War]] during the fighting retreat of the German forces in Italy. The 6th Armoured Division captured the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forl\u00ec on 18 September.\n\n===Spring 1945 Offensive===\n{{Main|Spring 1945 offensive in Italy}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18585.jpg|thumb|A Sherman and Stuart reconnaissance tank of the [[Lothian and Border Horse|2nd Lothian and Border Horse]], part of the 6th Armoured Division, near Rufina, Italy, 12 September 1944.]]\nIn the fertile plains of Northern Italy, the mountains gave way to ditches, canals and flood banks. As the wet winter weather, which had turned the rivers into torrents and swamped the ground receded, the Fifth and Eighth Armies were able to launch their final offensive in Italy in March 1945. The 6th Armoured Division had re-joined the Eighth Army as part of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]]. On the right wing of the armies, V Corps attacked across the Senio river and then the Santerno river. Elements of the [[56th (London) Infantry Division]] and the 78th (Battleaxe) Infantry Division then drove on towards the town of Argenta where the dry land narrowed to a front of only {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} bounded on the right by Lake Comacchio, a huge lagoon running to the Adriatic coast and on the left by marshland. By 19 April, the Argenta Gap had been forced and 6th Armoured was released through the left wing of the advancing 78th Division, to swing left to race north west along the line of the river Reno to Bondeno and link up with units of the Fifth Army advancing north from west of Bologna, to complete the encirclement of the German divisions defending Bologna. On all fronts the German defence continued to be determined and effective but Bondeno was captured on 23 April. The 6th Armoured Division linked with the [[10th Mountain Division]] (US [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]]) the next day at Finale. The IV Corps had broken through onto the plains on 19 April, bypassing Bologna on their right. Bologna was entered by the Poles advancing up the line of Route 9 on 21 April, followed two hours later by the US II Corps from the south.\n\nIV Corps had continued its northwards advance and reached the river Po at [[San Benedetto Po|San Benedetto]] on 22 April. The river was crossed the next day and it advanced north to [[Verona]], which was entered on 26 April. XIII Corps crossed the Po at [[Ficarolo]] on 22 April, while further east V Corps was crossing the Po by 25 April, heading towards the [[Venetian Line]], a defensive line built behind the line of the river Adige. V Corps, met by lessening resistance, traversed the Venetian Line and entered [[Padua]] in the early hours of 29 April, to find that partisans had locked up the German garrison of 5,000 men.<ref>Blaxland, p. 277</ref> As April came to an end, Army Group C, the Axis forces in Italy, retreating on all fronts and having lost most of its fighting powers, was left with little option but to surrender. General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]], who had taken command of the army group sent a representative to sign the instrument of surrender on behalf of the German armies in Italy on 29 April, formally bringing hostilities in Italy to an end on 2 May 1945.\n\n==Post war==\nThe Division was reformed in May 1951 in the UK and later assigned to the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in Germany. It consisted of the [[British 20th Armoured Brigade|20th Armoured Brigade]] and 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade. It was disbanded in June 1958.\n\n==General Officer Commanding==\n\nCommanders included:<ref>[http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf Army Comnmands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211343/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |date=5 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{|width=\"600\"\n|'''Appointed'''\n|'''General Officer Commanding'''\n|-\n|27 September 1940\n|[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[John Crocker]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\">Joslen, p. 17</ref>\n|-\n|9 January 1941\n|[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Evelyn Fanshawe]] (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|22 February 1941\n|Major-General John Crocker<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|15 October 1941\n|Major-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|29 October 1941\n|Major-General [[Charles Gairdner]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 May 1942\n|Major-General [[Charles Keightley]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 December 1943\n|Major-General [[Vyvyan Evelegh]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|15 February 1944\n|Brigadier William Edward Gordon Hemming (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|19 March 1944\n|Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|24 July 1944\n|Major-General [[Gerald Templer]] (wounded 5 August 1944)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|5 August 1944\n|Brigadier C.A.M.D. Scott (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|13 August 1944\n|Brigadier [[Francis Mitchell (British Army officer)|Francis Mitchell]] (acting)<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|21 August 1944\n|Major-General [[Horatius Murray]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|-\n|27 July 1945\n|Brigadier [[Adrian Clements Gore]]<ref name=\"Joslen17\"/>\n|}\n<br />\n{|width=\"600\"\n|'''Appointed'''\n|'''General Officer Commanding'''\n|-\n|1951\n|Major-General [[George Erroll Prior-Palmer|George Prior-Palmer]]<ref>'PRIOR-PALMER, Maj.-Gen.

{"title_page": "Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci", "text_new": "NOTHING TO SEE HERE\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention. A Search for Traces |Publisher=A.TE.M. |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISBN=978-3-00-063700-1|Date=2019|language=English}}</ref>\n\nA recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by [[Fritjof Capra]] argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\nLeonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}.

And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: \u2018I will not write this because I wrote it before.\u2019 And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.<ref name= JPR/></blockquote>\n\n==Natural science==\n[[File:Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres.jpg|thumb|upright|Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere ([[chiaroscuro]]).]]\n\n===Light===\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}</ref> had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles.

He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them.

Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia \"Leonardo da Vinci\"]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].  \n\nWhile the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, during his lifetime he was employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the [[parachute]], the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Innocenzi |first1=Plinio |title=The innovators behind Leonardo: The True Story of the Scientific and Technological Renaissance |date=2018 |publisher=Cham: Springer International Publishing |isbn=9783319904481}}</ref> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).\n\nLeonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]] in [[Renaissance humanism]].\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention. A Search for Traces |Publisher=A.TE.M. |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISBN=978-3-00-063700-1|Date=2019|language=English}}</ref>\n\nA recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by [[Fritjof Capra]] argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\nLeonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}. (accessed 2007-02-04)</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: \u2018I will not write this because I wrote it before.\u2019 And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.<ref name= JPR/></blockquote>\n\n==Natural science==\n[[File:Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres.jpg|thumb|upright|Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere ([[chiaroscuro]]).]]\n\n===Light===\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}</ref> had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles.

He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Bridges and hydraulics===\n[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]\nLeonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia \"Leonardo da Vinci\"]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

This later became the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Infantry Brigade]]. Duties in Malta included airfield repair and working as stevedores in the docks. Malta was subjected to a [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|prolonged siege]] and, by July 1942, the food situation had become serious, but the situation eased as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' fortunes improved in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, the 231st Brigade, including the 1st Hampshires, was moved to Alexandria, then subsequently to Cairo and Suez, where it trained as an [[Brigade group|independent assault brigade]]. Then, in July 1943, the 1st Battalion invaded [[Sicily]] as part of the first wave of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The beach landing went smoothly, but the 1st Battalion ran into resistance at [[Vizzini]] on 13 July when it ran into the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Herman Goring Parachute Panzer Division]]. On 22 July, the 1st Battalion was engaged in hard fighting for Agria, which only fell on 29 July. The 1st Battalion was reduced to three companies after the battle. There was further hard fighting to capture the Regalbuto Ridge, which ended the Sicilian Campaign. The 1st Battalion suffered 18 Officers and 286 Other Ranks killed or wounded in action in Sicily.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 128</ref>\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the 231st Brigade [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]], coming ashore at Potro San Venere near Pizzo.

On 6 June 1944, the 1st Battalion came ashore as part of [[Operation Overlord]] without any supporting tanks.

This culminated in a major assault on 11 July. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line the next day, testimony to the hard fighting. The Battalion was in the vanguard of the assault towards Villiers Bocage later in the month. There were stiff fights at St Germain d\u2019Ectot and Launay. Villiers Bocage was taken on 4 August, following which the 50th Division was taken out of the line.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 228</ref>\nIn August 1944, a brigade attack was launched towards Conde, and the Battalion attacked St Pierre la Vielle. The fighting was particularly hard and, after the 11-hour battle, three of its [[Rifle company|Rifle companies]] were severely reduced \u2013 \u2018B\u2019 Company had 25 men, \u2018C\u2019 Company had 35 men, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was down to just 12 men; as \u2018A\u2019 Company was only lightly engaged, it was not so depleted. On 12 August, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line. The Battalion was [[Motorized infantry|motorised]] and joined with the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] for the breakout attack later in the month. There was no fighting and, on 31 August, the 1st Battalion crossed the river Seine at Vernon and swept on to Amiens.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was then placed under command of the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and swept into Brussels on 3 September. The Battalion, still under command of the Guards Armoured, then started the attack towards Eindhoven, which was the attack designed to relieve the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish]] [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]] [[Battle of Arnhem|fighting at Arnhem]], who had dropped as part of [[Operation Market Garden]], which ended in a failure.

In October, the 1st Battalion moved up to Nijmegen and moved onto \"The Island\", the bridgehead over the river Waal but behind the river Lek.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 242</ref>\n\nIn October 1944, the Battalion attacked north of Bemmel, and expanded the bridgehead up to the Wettering Canal. The Battalion then went onto the defensive until the end of November. The Battalion then moved back to Ypres in Belgium, and subsequently was moved back to the United Kingdom with the rest of the 50th Division, and the men were mainly used as replacements for other infantry battalions, with the exception of a small training [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] consisting of 12 officers and 100 other ranks. The battalion ended the war in Louth, Lincolnshire.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 244</ref> Since D-Day, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment had suffered over 1,281 casualties, including 231 officers and men killed in action, the rest being either wounded or missing in action.<ref>Monty's Northern Legions: 50th Northumbrian and 15th Scottish Divisions at War 1939-1945: Patrick Delaforce</ref>\n\n====The 2nd Battalion====\nThe 2nd Battalion was also a [[Regular army|Regular Army]] battalion and started the war in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 59</ref> In September 1939, the 2nd Battalion moved to Cherbourg, France with the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]], alongside the 3rd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] and the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]], attached to [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]]. It then moved to Sille-le-Guillaume, and from there 250 miles north to take its allocated place on the \"Gort Line\", which it reached on 3 October. Later that month, the Battalion moved to the Belgian/French border and, in February 1940, the Battalion spent three weeks on the Maginot Line before returning to Metz.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 61</ref>\n\nThe Battalion crossed into Belgium in response to the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] and, by 14 May, was digging into a defensive position. While an attack never came, with the retreat of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch]] and the [[Ninth Army (France)|French Ninth Army]], the 1st Division was ordered to retreat on 16 May. A slow retreat then commenced, ending at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The Battalion began to be embarked from Dunkirk for the United Kingdom (some were evacuated on 2 June). The battalion managed to carry away 100% of their small-arms, mortars and anti-tank rifles. It was congratulated by the Minister for War, Mr [[Anthony Eden]]. The battalion then spent two years on home defence, training and preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] that never arrived.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, the Battalion, Hampshire Regiment sailed for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], taking part in [[Operation Torch]] with the 1st Guards Brigade, which was now part of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]]. They disembarked at Algiers on 21 November and joined the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]]. Later that month, the Battalion moved to Tebourba.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 89</ref> The following day the 2nd Battalion were attacked by heavy shelling and, on 1 December, the Battalion was attacked by a force four times its size, which was able to outflank it and rake it with enfilading fire. This was the start of three days of fierce close combat, fought at close quarters and featuring bayonet charges and counter-charges. The battalion was forced back a mile and a half and, on 3 December, [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Wallace Le Patourel]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his gallantry in leading counter-attacks against the enemy. After three days, the Battalion retreated through Tebourba, only to find all other troops had been withdrawn and the road behind them was cut. The battalion broke into small groups and attempted to break through to allied lines, reuniting at Medjez-el-Bab; many, including the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], were captured. The Battalion, which had started the battle with 689 men, was down to 194 men. The battalion was withdrawn from the line and in December, nine officers and 260 other ranks joined the 2nd Battalion.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 99</ref> After the fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943, the 2nd Battalion joined the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] attached to [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th (West Riding) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 118</ref>\n\n====The 128th Infantry Brigade====\nThe Hampshire Regiment had a number of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) battalions, whose ranks were swelled throughout 1939 when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size. During 1939, due to the number of new recruits, the 5/7th Battalion was split into the 5th Battalion and the 7th Battalion, and the 4th Battalion was split into the 1/4th Battalion and the 2/4th Battalion. The 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions were all grouped into the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Infantry Brigade]] (the \"Hampshire Brigade\") and the 7th Battalion was part of the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]]. Both brigades were part of the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 75</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H16713.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 2/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment scale an obstacle during 'toughening up' training in wintry conditions at [[Wateringbury]] in [[Kent]], 20 January 1942.]]\n\nHowever, on 6 June 1942, the 128th Brigade was detached from the 43rd Division until 15 August, when it was transferred to the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Division]], where it would remain for the rest of the war. In January 1943, the brigade left Britain with the rest of the 46th Infantry Division, for North Africa, as part of [[Operation Torch]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 76</ref> The brigade disembarked at Algiers on 17 January, moving to Bone, where it remained until the end of January, when the brigade moved to Hunts Gap.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 102</ref>\n\n{{Further|Operation Ochsenkopf}}\n\nThe 5th Battalion was sent 12 miles further ahead to Sidi Nsir. The 5th Battalion at Sidi N'sir was attacked in overwhelming strength in February 1943 as the Germans began Operation \"Ox Head\", a Corps level assault by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|German Paratroopers]], elements of [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion. The 5th Battalion was supported by 155th Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The Germans had to take the Hampshires' hilltop positions before they could attack the artillery, knocking out all the guns, whose crews stood and died firing over open sights at the German tanks. Only nine gunners survived. At 5pm, \u2018B\u2019 Company of the 5th Battalion, reduced to 30 men, was overrun. At dusk, the battalion considered its position untenable, and it withdrew to a feature known as \"Hampshire Farm\". Of the four [[Company (military unit)|Rifle Companies]], only \u2018C\u2019 Company, less a single [[platoon]], and 30 men of \u2018D\u2019 Company, remained. The German force was delayed for one critical day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 107</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the Hampshire Brigade was attacked at Hunt's Gap by the German force that had been delayed at Sidi N'sir. 2/4th was the main Battalion engaged, with 1/4th Battalion in support. The 2/5th [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicesters]] was attached to the brigade as well. The situation was so precarious that the 2nd Hampshires, still training its new recruits, was put into the line alongside 1/4th Battalion. The brigade was supported by plenty of artillery and the [[Churchill tank]]s of the [[North Irish Horse]]. Extensive minefields and heavy dive bombing kept the German tanks at bay. On 28 February, a pre-dawn attack penetrated the 2/4th battalion's \u2018B\u2019 Company positions, but heroic resistance and the tanks of the North Irish Horse kept the Germans at bay until dusk, when \u2018B\u2019 Company was overrun. \u2018C\u2019 Company was overrun by German infantry. On 1 March, the Germans attacked again, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun, but 2/4th Battalion hung on to their remaining positions. On 2 March, the Germans withdrew, and on 5 March the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the 8th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] of [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Brigade]] of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Division]]. The 2/4th Battalion had suffered 243 men killed or missing.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring March, the brigade was engaged on defensive patrolling, under heavy shelling. 1/4th Battalion lost 100 casualties during March, but 5th Battalion received 5 Officers and 150 men as replacements. On 5 April, the brigade handed over its positions and moved 100 miles south to El Ala. The 128th Brigade subsequently captured the Fondouk Gap, allowing the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]] to pass through and debouche onto the Kairouan Plain.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 114</ref> In April 1943, the 128th Infantry Brigade attacked Bou Arada. The 16th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]] was added to the brigade for the attack. Five Field regiments and two Medium regiments of the Royal Artillery supported the 128th Brigade. Early progress was good, but when the mist cleared all four battalions were caught in the open under heavy fire, and losses mounted. The rifle companies of 1/4th Battalion only had 3 Officers and 80 men left between them and the 2/4th Battalion had to reorganise onto a three-company basis.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 117</ref>\n\nTunis fell and the [[North African Campaign]] was over in May 1943. The 128th Infantry Brigade was reconstituted to consist of 2nd Battalion, 1/4th Battalion and 5th Battalion. The 2/4th Battalion was split into two to form two Defence Units of two [[Beach groups|Beach Groups]]. Their role was to protect the maintenance area of a Beach Group when it made a landing where no port was available.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 119</ref>\n\nThe 128th Infantry Brigade was one of three British brigades that made an assault landing at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] in Italy as part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] under command of [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]], led by [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore batteries firing shrapnel, and the beaches were raked by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran \u2018B\u2019 Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, the Germans started a general assault against the Salerno bridgehead, which made good progress; the [[VI Corps (United States)|US VI Corps]] were almost driven into the sea. However, the arrival of [[82nd Airborne Division|US paratroops]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Armoured Division]] turned the tide. The 128th Brigade was in the hills above Salerno, and the fighting was hard, but on 20 September the Germans began to withdraw northwards, and the pressure eased.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 144</ref> All three battalions had suffered \u2013 2nd Battalion suffered 304 casualties, 1/4th Battalion suffered 159 casualties and the 5th Battalion suffered 29 officer and over 400 other rank casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade, still part of the X Corps, moved up to the River Volturno, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. On 10 October, the 1/4th Battalion captured the town of Castel Volturno, alongside the river, and on 12 October the 1/4th made a night assault across the river, establishing a small bridgehead. The 2nd and 5th battalions moved across the river in support, but the entire 128th Brigade was soon engaged in a stiff fire-fight. The brigade advanced some 2,500 yards, and then dug in behind a canal as the Germans bought up tanks. The brigade remained in the low-lying, swampy, mosquito-ridden land between the river and the canal until the Germans withdrew due to a breakthrough elsewhere. The brigade then advanced along Route 7, meeting little resistance. The 128th Brigade was then taken out of the line for [[R&R (military)|R&R]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 151</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the Hampshire Brigade moved up to the River Garigliano. It was relieved on 11 January, and moved back to the River Volturno. They were selected as the Assault Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, and trained in river crossings. Then, in January 1944, the Hampshire Brigade made a night assault across the swift flowing River Garigliano. The brigade had severe problems getting the boats through the minefields down to the river, and in the darkness confusion reigned. Only a few men managed to get across, and these were withdrawn at daylight. The Hampshire Brigade then assaulted Monte Damiano, a bare, razor-backed feature, already strewn with British dead from [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]]. The assault was made by the 1/4th and 2nd battalions in daylight, and immediately came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. The attack was made with great dash, but it failed, with heavy casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th Battalion was put under the command of the [[138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade|138th Infantry Brigade]], part of the 46th Division, to assault Mounts Ornito and Cerasola in February 1944. The assault met little opposition, although the Germans put in spirited counter-attacks on Mount Ornito, which were all driven off. However, as the days passed, the casualties mounted from heavy shelling; the bare rock made cover difficult. In eight days, the 5th Battalion suffered 200 casualties. Supply was particularly difficult, as supplies had to be carried up by mules and porters for 3 to 4 hours from the nearest road. On 7 February, the 5th Battalion attacked Mount Cerasola, a successful assault. On 10 February, the 5th Battalion was relieved.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Brigade was relieved later in the month. It moved south to Naples and, on 16 March, sailed for Egypt, and subsequently moved to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and back to Egypt. All battalions were brought up to strength, largely from gunners from disbanded Middle-East Anti-Aircraft units who were retrained as infantrymen. On 27 June, the 128th Brigade sailed from Alexandria, and subsequently landed in Taranto. The move north through Italy was at an easy pace.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the 128th Brigade started its assault on the \"[[Gothic Line]]\", a line of German defences across the Etruscan Apennines. The Hampshire brigade, with the North Irish Horse under command, led the 46th Division's assault (along with the [[Reconnaissance Corps#Units|46th Reconnaissance Regiment]]). The brigade's first target was to cross the River Metauro and take Monte Bartolo. The assault went to plan against little opposition, and Mount Bartolo was captured by the morning of 29 August. The brigade had marched 25 miles to cover 12 miles as the crow flies, and climbed 1,500 feet. Only the 1/4th Battalion had come across serious opposition, engaging in heavy fighting around Montegaudio. Later in the month the brigade assaulted the Gothic Line proper, crossing the River Foglia and assaulting Monte Gridolfo. This was heavily defended, with all cover cleared from its bare slopes. Nevertheless, the men of the 2nd Battalion assaulted them with great vigour, and by dawn on 31 August they had captured the first crest. The 1/4th Battalion passed through, driving deeper into Gothic Line. During this assault, [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] [[Gerard Ross Norton|Gerard Norton]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. On 1 September, the 5th Battalion took the lead, and by 2 September had captured Meleto. The Gothic Line had been breached. A fighting advance continued northwards. On 5 September the 128th Brigade was relieved, and sent to the rear for rest, but they were back in the line by 11 September.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade began an assault on Montescudo in September 1944. Montescudo was defended by the German 100th Mountain Regiment, and they put up a desperate resistance. Other elements of the Brigade assaulted Trarivi, which was captured by 16 September. On 18 September, the brigade was relieved. All three battalions were short of men, even after replacements were received from the 1st Battalion, [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)]]. The Hampshire Brigade crossed the River Fiumicino, and then the Rubicon. The weather was atrocious, and movement was slowed by deep mud, and supply was difficult. Fighting continued until 9 October. A steady advance was made, and by 12 November the River Montone was crossed; on 26 November the [[Lamone (river)|River Lamone]] was reached. This was crossed on 3 December in the face of stiff opposition, and by 6 December the Brigade had captured Casa Nova. The Brigade was relieved the following day, and moved well to the rear. From 24 August (when the 128th Brigade moved up to the Gothic Line) to 7 December, when they were relieved, the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade had suffered 1,276 casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 203</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 the 2nd Battalion and the 5th Battalion embarked from Taranto and disembarked in Piraeus, Greece, two days later. 1/4th Battalion arrived on 22 January. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (now known as \"Tigerforce\") split its battalions, and set about disarming the [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S Army]]. The troops were welcomed everywhere, and there was no fighting. Then, in April 1945, the brigade began to return to Italy for the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|final offensive]]. By 1 May, the brigade was back in the line around Forlimpopoli; but the war ended before the brigade was in action again.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 210</ref>\n\n====The 2/4th Battalion====\nThe 20th [[Beach groups|Beach Group]] (\"A\" and \"B\" companies) invaded Sicily as part of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] in July 1943. The role of the Beach Group was to land supplies until a harbour could be captured. On 12 July, 20 Beach Group moved inland, behind the advancing infantry, but by 22 July the half-battalion was in the line, capturing Mount Scalpello. On 4 August, the half-battalion moved to Catania, where it remained on garrison duty.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn September 1943, the 21st Beach Group (\"C\" and \"D\" companies) invaded Salerno. The assault went in at dawn against stiff opposition and, rather than take its allotted role, the half-battalion was moved straight into the line. However, there was little action until 13 September, when the half-battalion was attacked by armoured half-tracks. This happened again on 15 September when \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun. However, the half-tracks didn\u2019t assault \u2018D\u2019 Company as such, they ran over the slit trenches until picked off by [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6pdr anti-tank guns]]. On 17 September, the half-battalion was moved back into reserve and, by 23 September, it was back on the beaches unloading cargo.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 136</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the two halves of the 2/4th Battalion were re-united at Pontecagnano near Salerno. However, there was no immediate employment, and orders were received to send cadres to the three battalions in the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] (this was rescinded after protests). However, six officers and 77 other ranks were posted away to form the \"2/4th Hampshire Training Centre\", three officers and 188 other ranks were assigned to \u2018porterage duties\u2019 and a detachment of 50 men was assigned to help the Provost Corps with traffic duties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 137</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was back in the line in Italy, near Garigliano, as part of [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade]], in [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in February 1944. This was the same ground where the Hampshire Brigade had suffered through the Italian winter. The battalion was relieved for short periods on a regular basis before returning to the line. In May 1944, the Battalion assisted the Brigade's two other battalions (2nd [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's]] and 2nd [[Somerset Light Infantry|Somersets]]) in crossing the River Rapido as part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]]. The river and bank were under intense enemy fire, and the river so swift that swimmers from 2/4th had to cross with lines to enable the boats to get across. Troops got across the river, but could make little headway against the storm of machine gun fire. The 2/4th could not get across to join their fellow battalions, and so, on 12 May, it came under command of [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Infantry Brigade]] and crossed via a bridge on 13 May. Supported by the [[17th/21st Lancers]]'s [[Sherman tank]]s, the 2/4th Battalion attacked along the river, taking 200 prisoners. On 14 May, back in ther 28th Brigade, the 2/4th attempted to cross the River Pioppeta. The tank bridge sank in the mud, and the battalion took 100 casualties in two minutes. The 2/4th waded the river and, in spite of heavy casualties and fierce resistance, the advance continued. During this advance, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Richard Wakeford]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. By 6.30pm, all objectives had been captured, and the 2/4th reorganised on a three-company basis. On 16 May, the battalion was relieved. Two days later, Cassino was captured by the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 171</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, the Battalion was back in the line near the village of Villastrada, between Lake Chiusi and Lake Trasimeno to north of Rome. On 24 June, a major attack was launched on that section of the Trasimene Line by 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry supported by the tanks of the [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12th Canadian Armoured Regiment]]. 2/4th Hampshires was to follow on, but its entry into battle was delayed until the next day. Having passed through the village of Vaiano, which was unoccupied, an attack was launched on a ridge being held by the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]]. Although \"C\" Company established a foothold on the ridge, occupying a farmhouse, that night a fierce German counter-attack was made by the Germans, who overran the company headquarters. Fighting was close and confused, and the company ran low on ammunition. It was forced back to literally the last ditch, but hung on. At dawn the next day, 26 June, the battalion counter-attacked and managed to recapture its previous positions; the Germans were withdrawing to the Arezzo Line. The 2/4th Battalion followed up, coming into action again on 21 July. Supported by the [[North Irish Horse]], a steady advance was made. The 2/4th Battalion was then taken out of the line again \u2013 some platoons were down to ten men each with no officer.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 176</ref>\n\nThe Battalion then attacked Santa Lucia, which was captured on 30 July 1944 after a small but fierce battle. The enemy then withdrew, and the Battalion moved up to the River Arno. On 10 August, the battalion was withdrawn. In September 1944, the Battalion began its assault on the Gothic Line, attacking across the River Marano and capturing Casa Bagli. All the first day objectives were achieved, and the 2/4th defended them on 16 September against German counter-attacks. On 17 September, the battalion captured Cerasola; it was relieved the following day. The battalion then moved north behind the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]\u2019s advance, arriving in time to stand by to support the Hampshire Brigade's assault on Forli during November. During 22 November, the 2/4th attacked and captured a bridgehead over the River Cosina against heavy shelling; this was the battalion's last action in Italy.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, the Battalion was flown to Greece in the bomb-bays of Wellington and Liberator bombers in response to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]], arriving on 12 December. The [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S. Army]], armed and trained by the British, was trying to overthrow the [[Greek Government]]. On arrival, the 2/4th Battalion was split up, primarily defending the airfield, then clearing E.L.A.S. forces from Athens. This did involve some fighting, and the 2/4th Battalion lost three men killed. The 2/4th Battalion then settled down to peace-keeping duties. In May 1945, the Battalion was moved to Crete to take charge of the Germans, who had surrendered, and they ended the war there.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 209</ref>\n\n====The 7th Battalion====\nThe 7th Battalion was a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, originally the 5/7th Battalion until it was split into the 5th and 7th battalions when the Territorial Army was doubled in size in the spring and summer of 1939. The 7th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom training long and hard for many years until after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\">Scott Daniell, p. 78</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was sent to Normandy as reinforcements with the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]] attached to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. In June 1944, the Battalion landed near Le Hamel. They were with 130th Brigade (with 4th and 5th [[Dorset Regiment|Dorsets]]) and were initially held in reserve. The Battalion [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|attacked Maltot]], supported by tanks of [[9th Royal Tank Regiment]] (9th RTR) in July 1944. The village was defended by [[Waffen-SS]] troops supported by [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s. Both the 7th Battalion and 9th RTR suffered severe casualties, and although the 7th Battalion managed to fight its way into the village it was withdrawn. The 7th Battalion suffered 18 officer and 208 other rank casualties, including 4 officers and 12 other ranks killed, but was back in the line two days later.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 233</ref>\n\nThe Battalion attacked the village of Cahagnes later in the month. This was fought in typical \u2018[[bocage]]\u2019 countryside, but after the initial attack by the brigade ran into difficulties, 7th Battalion deployed from reserves and captured Cahagnes, beating off several [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counter-attacks. On 2 August, the battalion moved up to Jurques, and after a short stiff fight advanced to \"Point 132\", close to [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mount Pincon]]. On 6 August, the battalion put in a deceptive attack on Mount Pincon, making a diversion whilst [[129th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|129th Infantry Brigade]] made a flank attack. During heavy fighting, 'C' Company incurred many casualties, including all the officers. Following the successful flank attack by the 129th Brigade, the 7th Battalion mopped up and concentrated near Mauny by 10 August.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 237</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the Battalion captured St Denis de Mere after a bombardment by nine artillery regiments. The Battalion took 74 prisoners and then prepared for \"The Breakout\". The Battalion then moved 50 miles north-east to Conches and, by 27 August, the 7th Battalion was across the River Seine. The battalion then participated in the capture of Tilly, and thereafter spent 11 days taking in replacements and resting. In September 1944, the Battalion started to move to Brussels for temporary garrison duty, arriving the next day. This easy duty was welcome; since landing in Normandy in June, the 7th Hampshires had lost (including wounded) 35 officers and 450 other ranks.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe Battalion fought in [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. On 20 September, the battalion moved through Eindhoven to Grave. The battalion was tasked with defending the southern end of the two large bridges over the Waal. On 23 September, the 7th was sent into the line, fighting west of the bridges in the Valburg-Elst area. It then moved to the \"Island\" and stayed there until 4 October, before moving to the Groesbeek-Mook area on the Dutch-German border.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn November 1944, the Battalion was moved to Maastricht, and then moved around as divisional reserve. On 19 December, the German launched their [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], which caused the 7th Battalion to move north of Liege to guard the bridges over the Meuse. On 26 December, the 7th Battalion moved to Aachen, and on 12 January moved again to Teveren. Then, in January 1945, the Battalion captured Putt, then Waldenrath, and on 25 January captured Dremmen and Porselen. The Battalion advanced south-east from Cleves as part of the big [[Operation Veritable|Reichwald offensive]]. Over two days fighting for Berkhofel, the 7th lost 70 casualties. It was relieved on 17 February.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 250</ref>\n\nThe Battalion [[Operation Plunder|crossed the Rhine]] in assault craft, consolidating on the far bank and then advancing across the IJssel Canal to Milligen, which was captured on 26 March. German resistance was collapsing, and the 7th moved over the Twente Canal on 1 April, liberating Hengelo. In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation \"Forward On\", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance. However, on 13 April, the Battalion had a hard fight for Cloppenburg, a fight that was as hard as any they had fought, vicious hand-to-hand fighting from street to street. Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the [[Royal Engineers]] and a single [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]], which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners. The 7th Battalion reached Gnarrenburg on 3 May, and were still there when the Germans surrendered the following day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 272</ref>\n\n====The Home Based Battalions====\nAlthough the Hampshire Regiment sent six battalions overseas, many more stayed at home as training units or were converted to other roles. Before the war, the 6th Battalion (Duke of Connaught's Own), Hampshire Regiment was converted into the 59th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, and upon the Territorial Army being doubled in size in 1939, formed a 2nd Line duplicate. The 59th Anti-Tank Regiment served with the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] and went with them to [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\"/>\n\nThe original [[Isle of Wight Rifles|8th Battalion (Isle of Wight Rifles)]], Hampshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and made into an artillery battery in 1937. However, a new 8th Battalion was formed, shortly after the war began, at Southampton in December 1939. It subsequently split into the 1/8th and 2/8th Battalions, before the 2/8th Battalion was renamed the 13th Battalion, and then both battalions were re-formed into the 8th Battalion again, which was subsequently renumbered the 30th Battalion and was disbanded in September 1942.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 79</ref>\n\nThe 9th Battalion was formed on the Isle of Wight in July 1940 and was later assigned to the [[201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]]. In 1942, the battalion was converted to armour as the 157th Regiment [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and assigned to [[36th Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Army Tank Brigade]]. Units converted in this way continued to wear their infantry cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.<ref>George Forty (1998), \"British Army Handbook 1939\u20131945\", Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50\u20131.</ref> However, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943 and 157 RAC was broken up in August, without having seen active service.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe 10th Battalion was formed in Aldershot in July 1940; it was assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 9th Battalion. In 1941, the 10th Hampshire was also transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, becoming the [[147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]], and was assigned to the [[34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Army Tank Brigade]].<ref>Forty pp. 50\u20131.</ref> Its [[Churchill tank]]s were named after Hampshire Regiment battles (the [[Commanding officer|CO]]\u2019s tank was called \"Minden\"). The regiment went to serve with distinction with 34th Tank Brigade in the [[North West Europe Campaign]] at Normandy, [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]], the [[Operation Veritable|Reichswald Forest]] and [[Operation Plunder]] from 1944 to 1945 .<ref>Forty p. 345.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Britain, 1941 H10633.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 12th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment in training at Hengistbury Head near Bournemouth, Dorset.

The Jersey Militia subsequently became the 11th Battalion, whilst the rest of the 50th Battalion became the 12th Battalion. The 11th Battalion stayed in the United Kingdom as a training battalion until the war ended, first with the [[209th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|209th Brigade]] and later with the [[135th (2/1st South Western) Brigade|135th Brigade]], [[45th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|45th (Holding) Division]]. The 12th Battalion also stayed in the United Kingdom, with the [[136th (2/1st Devon and Cornwall) Brigade|136th Brigade]], but was disbanded in September 1944 after sending a large final draft to the 7th Battalion serving in North-west Europe.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 84</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed in Southampton, but soon moved to Basingstoke. It was raised for those soldiers around the age of 18 or 19 who had volunteered for the Army but were not old enough to be [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]], the age being 20 at the time. However, the battalion was disbanded in July 1943 as the British government lowered the age of conscription for the [[British Armed Forces]] from 20 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://16dli.awardspace.com/page305.html|title=The Officers of the 70th Young Soldiers Battalion, DLI, October 1941|accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Regiment's Depot had been in Winchester since long before the Second World War.

On 20 February 1921, soldiers from the Battalion took part in the [[Clonmult ambush]] during which the IRA suffered its greatest loss of volunteers in conflict.<ref>Tom O'Neill, ''The Battle of Clonmult: The IRA's Worst Defeat'' (Dublin: Nonsuch, 2006)</ref> Regimental historian Scott Daniell commented on the action that ''\"like all the Irish operations, it was hateful to the British troops\"''.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 11</ref> On 31 May 1921, seven soldiers, all with the band of the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment were on their way to the rifle range at Youghal County Cork when a road mine exploded under the truck they were travelling in.

By the end of the Second World War, 2,094 officers and men of the Hampshire Regiment had lost their lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1rhamps.com/hampshireR/hamps.html|title=1st and 2nd Battalions The Hampshire Regiment|work=1rhamps.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n====The 1st Battalion====\nThe 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment was a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] unit that was deployed on Garrison duties in El Daba, Egypt at the beginning of the war.<ref name=scott46>Scott Daniell, p. 46</ref> It moved to Palestine on peace keeping duties in December 1939 and then moved to Moascar in Egypt, then to Mearsa Matruh in Summer 1940. One of its duties was to look after the large number of Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] after the fall of Sidi Barrani.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 50</ref>\n\nIn February 1941, the 1st Battalion arrived in [[Malta]], where it became part of the 1st (Malta) Infantry Brigade (with 1st [[Dorset Regiment]] and 2nd [[Devonshire Regiment]]). This later became the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Infantry Brigade]]. Duties in Malta included airfield repair and working as stevedores in the docks. Malta was subjected to a [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|prolonged siege]] and, by July 1942, the food situation had become serious, but the situation eased as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' fortunes improved in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, the 231st Brigade, including the 1st Hampshires, was moved to Alexandria, then subsequently to Cairo and Suez, where it trained as an [[Brigade group|independent assault brigade]]. Then, in July 1943, the 1st Battalion invaded [[Sicily]] as part of the first wave of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The beach landing went smoothly, but the 1st Battalion ran into resistance at [[Vizzini]] on 13 July when it ran into the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Herman Goring Parachute Panzer Division]]. On 22 July, the 1st Battalion was engaged in hard fighting for Agria, which only fell on 29 July. The 1st Battalion was reduced to three companies after the battle. There was further hard fighting to capture the Regalbuto Ridge, which ended the Sicilian Campaign. The 1st Battalion suffered 18 Officers and 286 Other Ranks killed or wounded in action in Sicily.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 128</ref>\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the 231st Brigade [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]], coming ashore at Potro San Venere near Pizzo. The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting as the Germans withdrew northwards. By October 1943, the 1st Battalion was back in Sicily waiting for transport back to the United Kingdom and, by November, the battalion was back in the United Kingdom for the first time in 22 years.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe battalion was allocated to the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], one of the assault divisions for the [[Invasion of Normandy|invasion of North West Europe]], which had an excellent reputation after fighting in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]]. On 6 June 1944, the 1st Battalion came ashore as part of [[Operation Overlord]] without any supporting tanks. Despite facing machine gun fire, the men captured Le Hamel and Arromanches after a hard fight. By the end of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] , the 1st Battalion had suffered 182 casualties, 64 of them being killed in action.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 219</ref>\n\nThe Battalion started a three-week fight for the village of Hottot, against the German [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]], in June 1944. This culminated in a major assault on 11 July. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line the next day, testimony to the hard fighting. The Battalion was in the vanguard of the assault towards Villiers Bocage later in the month. There were stiff fights at St Germain d\u2019Ectot and Launay. Villiers Bocage was taken on 4 August, following which the 50th Division was taken out of the line.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 228</ref>\nIn August 1944, a brigade attack was launched towards Conde, and the Battalion attacked St Pierre la Vielle. The fighting was particularly hard and, after the 11-hour battle, three of its [[Rifle company|Rifle companies]] were severely reduced \u2013 \u2018B\u2019 Company had 25 men, \u2018C\u2019 Company had 35 men, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was down to just 12 men; as \u2018A\u2019 Company was only lightly engaged, it was not so depleted. On 12 August, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line. The Battalion was [[Motorized infantry|motorised]] and joined with the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] for the breakout attack later in the month. There was no fighting and, on 31 August, the 1st Battalion crossed the river Seine at Vernon and swept on to Amiens.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was then placed under command of the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and swept into Brussels on 3 September. The Battalion, still under command of the Guards Armoured, then started the attack towards Eindhoven, which was the attack designed to relieve the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish]] [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]] [[Battle of Arnhem|fighting at Arnhem]], who had dropped as part of [[Operation Market Garden]], which ended in a failure. The Battalion, as part of 231st Infantry Brigade, was charged with defending the \"Corridor\" formed by the armoured advance. In October, the 1st Battalion moved up to Nijmegen and moved onto \"The Island\", the bridgehead over the river Waal but behind the river Lek.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 242</ref>\n\nIn October 1944, the Battalion attacked north of Bemmel, and expanded the bridgehead up to the Wettering Canal. The Battalion then went onto the defensive until the end of November. The Battalion then moved back to Ypres in Belgium, and subsequently was moved back to the United Kingdom with the rest of the 50th Division, and the men were mainly used as replacements for other infantry battalions, with the exception of a small training [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] consisting of 12 officers and 100 other ranks. The battalion ended the war in Louth, Lincolnshire.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 244</ref> Since D-Day, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment had suffered over 1,281 casualties, including 231 officers and men killed in action, the rest being either wounded or missing in action.<ref>Monty's Northern Legions: 50th Northumbrian and 15th Scottish Divisions at War 1939-1945: Patrick Delaforce</ref>\n\n====The 2nd Battalion====\nThe 2nd Battalion was also a [[Regular army|Regular Army]] battalion and started the war in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 59</ref> In September 1939, the 2nd Battalion moved to Cherbourg, France with the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]], alongside the 3rd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] and the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]], attached to [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]]. It then moved to Sille-le-Guillaume, and from there 250 miles north to take its allocated place on the \"Gort Line\", which it reached on 3 October. Later that month, the Battalion moved to the Belgian/French border and, in February 1940, the Battalion spent three weeks on the Maginot Line before returning to Metz.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 61</ref>\n\nThe Battalion crossed into Belgium in response to the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] and, by 14 May, was digging into a defensive position. While an attack never came, with the retreat of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch]] and the [[Ninth Army (France)|French Ninth Army]], the 1st Division was ordered to retreat on 16 May. A slow retreat then commenced, ending at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The Battalion began to be embarked from Dunkirk for the United Kingdom (some were evacuated on 2 June). The battalion managed to carry away 100% of their small-arms, mortars and anti-tank rifles. It was congratulated by the Minister for War, Mr [[Anthony Eden]]. The battalion then spent two years on home defence, training and preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] that never arrived.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, the Battalion, Hampshire Regiment sailed for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], taking part in [[Operation Torch]] with the 1st Guards Brigade, which was now part of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]]. They disembarked at Algiers on 21 November and joined the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]]. Later that month, the Battalion moved to Tebourba.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 89</ref> The following day the 2nd Battalion were attacked by heavy shelling and, on 1 December, the Battalion was attacked by a force four times its size, which was able to outflank it and rake it with enfilading fire. This was the start of three days of fierce close combat, fought at close quarters and featuring bayonet charges and counter-charges. The battalion was forced back a mile and a half and, on 3 December, [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Wallace Le Patourel]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his gallantry in leading counter-attacks against the enemy. After three days, the Battalion retreated through Tebourba, only to find all other troops had been withdrawn and the road behind them was cut. The battalion broke into small groups and attempted to break through to allied lines, reuniting at Medjez-el-Bab; many, including the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], were captured. The Battalion, which had started the battle with 689 men, was down to 194 men. The battalion was withdrawn from the line and in December, nine officers and 260 other ranks joined the 2nd Battalion.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 99</ref> After the fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943, the 2nd Battalion joined the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] attached to [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th (West Riding) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 118</ref>\n\n====The 128th Infantry Brigade====\nThe Hampshire Regiment had a number of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) battalions, whose ranks were swelled throughout 1939 when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size. During 1939, due to the number of new recruits, the 5/7th Battalion was split into the 5th Battalion and the 7th Battalion, and the 4th Battalion was split into the 1/4th Battalion and the 2/4th Battalion. The 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions were all grouped into the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Infantry Brigade]] (the \"Hampshire Brigade\") and the 7th Battalion was part of the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]]. Both brigades were part of the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 75</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H16713.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 2/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment scale an obstacle during 'toughening up' training in wintry conditions at [[Wateringbury]] in [[Kent]], 20 January 1942.]]\n\nHowever, on 6 June 1942, the 128th Brigade was detached from the 43rd Division until 15 August, when it was transferred to the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Division]], where it would remain for the rest of the war. In January 1943, the brigade left Britain with the rest of the 46th Infantry Division, for North Africa, as part of [[Operation Torch]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 76</ref> The brigade disembarked at Algiers on 17 January, moving to Bone, where it remained until the end of January, when the brigade moved to Hunts Gap.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 102</ref>\n\n{{Further|Operation Ochsenkopf}}\n\nThe 5th Battalion was sent 12 miles further ahead to Sidi Nsir. The 5th Battalion at Sidi N'sir was attacked in overwhelming strength in February 1943 as the Germans began Operation \"Ox Head\", a Corps level assault by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|German Paratroopers]], elements of [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion. The 5th Battalion was supported by 155th Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The Germans had to take the Hampshires' hilltop positions before they could attack the artillery, knocking out all the guns, whose crews stood and died firing over open sights at the German tanks. Only nine gunners survived. At 5pm, \u2018B\u2019 Company of the 5th Battalion, reduced to 30 men, was overrun. At dusk, the battalion considered its position untenable, and it withdrew to a feature known as \"Hampshire Farm\". Of the four [[Company (military unit)|Rifle Companies]], only \u2018C\u2019 Company, less a single [[platoon]], and 30 men of \u2018D\u2019 Company, remained. The German force was delayed for one critical day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 107</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the Hampshire Brigade was attacked at Hunt's Gap by the German force that had been delayed at Sidi N'sir. 2/4th was the main Battalion engaged, with 1/4th Battalion in support. The 2/5th [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicesters]] was attached to the brigade as well. The situation was so precarious that the 2nd Hampshires, still training its new recruits, was put into the line alongside 1/4th Battalion. The brigade was supported by plenty of artillery and the [[Churchill tank]]s of the [[North Irish Horse]]. Extensive minefields and heavy dive bombing kept the German tanks at bay. On 28 February, a pre-dawn attack penetrated the 2/4th battalion's \u2018B\u2019 Company positions, but heroic resistance and the tanks of the North Irish Horse kept the Germans at bay until dusk, when \u2018B\u2019 Company was overrun. \u2018C\u2019 Company was overrun by German infantry. On 1 March, the Germans attacked again, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun, but 2/4th Battalion hung on to their remaining positions. On 2 March, the Germans withdrew, and on 5 March the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the 8th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] of [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Brigade]] of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Division]]. The 2/4th Battalion had suffered 243 men killed or missing.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring March, the brigade was engaged on defensive patrolling, under heavy shelling. 1/4th Battalion lost 100 casualties during March, but 5th Battalion received 5 Officers and 150 men as replacements. On 5 April, the brigade handed over its positions and moved 100 miles south to El Ala. The 128th Brigade subsequently captured the Fondouk Gap, allowing the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]] to pass through and debouche onto the Kairouan Plain.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 114</ref> In April 1943, the 128th Infantry Brigade attacked Bou Arada. The 16th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]] was added to the brigade for the attack. Five Field regiments and two Medium regiments of the Royal Artillery supported the 128th Brigade. Early progress was good, but when the mist cleared all four battalions were caught in the open under heavy fire, and losses mounted. The rifle companies of 1/4th Battalion only had 3 Officers and 80 men left between them and the 2/4th Battalion had to reorganise onto a three-company basis.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 117</ref>\n\nTunis fell and the [[North African Campaign]] was over in May 1943. The 128th Infantry Brigade was reconstituted to consist of 2nd Battalion, 1/4th Battalion and 5th Battalion. The 2/4th Battalion was split into two to form two Defence Units of two [[Beach groups|Beach Groups]]. Their role was to protect the maintenance area of a Beach Group when it made a landing where no port was available.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 119</ref>\n\nThe 128th Infantry Brigade was one of three British brigades that made an assault landing at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] in Italy as part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] under command of [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]], led by [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore batteries firing shrapnel, and the beaches were raked by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran \u2018B\u2019 Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, the Germans started a general assault against the Salerno bridgehead, which made good progress; the [[VI Corps (United States)|US VI Corps]] were almost driven into the sea. However, the arrival of [[82nd Airborne Division|US paratroops]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Armoured Division]] turned the tide. The 128th Brigade was in the hills above Salerno, and the fighting was hard, but on 20 September the Germans began to withdraw northwards, and the pressure eased.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 144</ref> All three battalions had suffered \u2013 2nd Battalion suffered 304 casualties, 1/4th Battalion suffered 159 casualties and the 5th Battalion suffered 29 officer and over 400 other rank casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade, still part of the X Corps, moved up to the River Volturno, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. On 10 October, the 1/4th Battalion captured the town of Castel Volturno, alongside the river, and on 12 October the 1/4th made a night assault across the river, establishing a small bridgehead. The 2nd and 5th battalions moved across the river in support, but the entire 128th Brigade was soon engaged in a stiff fire-fight. The brigade advanced some 2,500 yards, and then dug in behind a canal as the Germans bought up tanks. The brigade remained in the low-lying, swampy, mosquito-ridden land between the river and the canal until the Germans withdrew due to a breakthrough elsewhere. The brigade then advanced along Route 7, meeting little resistance. The 128th Brigade was then taken out of the line for [[R&R (military)|R&R]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 151</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the Hampshire Brigade moved up to the River Garigliano. It was relieved on 11 January, and moved back to the River Volturno. They were selected as the Assault Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, and trained in river crossings. Then, in January 1944, the Hampshire Brigade made a night assault across the swift flowing River Garigliano. The brigade had severe problems getting the boats through the minefields down to the river, and in the darkness confusion reigned. Only a few men managed to get across, and these were withdrawn at daylight. The Hampshire Brigade then assaulted Monte Damiano, a bare, razor-backed feature, already strewn with British dead from [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]]. The assault was made by the 1/4th and 2nd battalions in daylight, and immediately came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. The attack was made with great dash, but it failed, with heavy casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th Battalion was put under the command of the [[138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade|138th Infantry Brigade]], part of the 46th Division, to assault Mounts Ornito and Cerasola in February 1944. The assault met little opposition, although the Germans put in spirited counter-attacks on Mount Ornito, which were all driven off. However, as the days passed, the casualties mounted from heavy shelling; the bare rock made cover difficult. In eight days, the 5th Battalion suffered 200 casualties. Supply was particularly difficult, as supplies had to be carried up by mules and porters for 3 to 4 hours from the nearest road. On 7 February, the 5th Battalion attacked Mount Cerasola, a successful assault. On 10 February, the 5th Battalion was relieved.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Brigade was relieved later in the month. It moved south to Naples and, on 16 March, sailed for Egypt, and subsequently moved to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and back to Egypt. All battalions were brought up to strength, largely from gunners from disbanded Middle-East Anti-Aircraft units who were retrained as infantrymen. On 27 June, the 128th Brigade sailed from Alexandria, and subsequently landed in Taranto. The move north through Italy was at an easy pace.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the 128th Brigade started its assault on the \"[[Gothic Line]]\", a line of German defences across the Etruscan Apennines. The Hampshire brigade, with the North Irish Horse under command, led the 46th Division's assault (along with the [[Reconnaissance Corps#Units|46th Reconnaissance Regiment]]). The brigade's first target was to cross the River Metauro and take Monte Bartolo. The assault went to plan against little opposition, and Mount Bartolo was captured by the morning of 29 August. The brigade had marched 25 miles to cover 12 miles as the crow flies, and climbed 1,500 feet. Only the 1/4th Battalion had come across serious opposition, engaging in heavy fighting around Montegaudio. Later in the month the brigade assaulted the Gothic Line proper, crossing the River Foglia and assaulting Monte Gridolfo. This was heavily defended, with all cover cleared from its bare slopes. Nevertheless, the men of the 2nd Battalion assaulted them with great vigour, and by dawn on 31 August they had captured the first crest. The 1/4th Battalion passed through, driving deeper into Gothic Line. During this assault, [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] [[Gerard Ross Norton|Gerard Norton]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. On 1 September, the 5th Battalion took the lead, and by 2 September had captured Meleto. The Gothic Line had been breached. A fighting advance continued northwards. On 5 September the 128th Brigade was relieved, and sent to the rear for rest, but they were back in the line by 11 September.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade began an assault on Montescudo in September 1944. Montescudo was defended by the German 100th Mountain Regiment, and they put up a desperate resistance. Other elements of the Brigade assaulted Trarivi, which was captured by 16 September. On 18 September, the brigade was relieved. All three battalions were short of men, even after replacements were received from the 1st Battalion, [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)]]. The Hampshire Brigade crossed the River Fiumicino, and then the Rubicon. The weather was atrocious, and movement was slowed by deep mud, and supply was difficult. Fighting continued until 9 October. A steady advance was made, and by 12 November the River Montone was crossed; on 26 November the [[Lamone (river)|River Lamone]] was reached. This was crossed on 3 December in the face of stiff opposition, and by 6 December the Brigade had captured Casa Nova. The Brigade was relieved the following day, and moved well to the rear. From 24 August (when the 128th Brigade moved up to the Gothic Line) to 7 December, when they were relieved, the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade had suffered 1,276 casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 203</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 the 2nd Battalion and the 5th Battalion embarked from Taranto and disembarked in Piraeus, Greece, two days later. 1/4th Battalion arrived on 22 January. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (now known as \"Tigerforce\") split its battalions, and set about disarming the [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S Army]]. The troops were welcomed everywhere, and there was no fighting. Then, in April 1945, the brigade began to return to Italy for the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|final offensive]]. By 1 May, the brigade was back in the line around Forlimpopoli; but the war ended before the brigade was in action again.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 210</ref>\n\n====The 2/4th Battalion====\nThe 20th [[Beach groups|Beach Group]] (\"A\" and \"B\" companies) invaded Sicily as part of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] in July 1943. The role of the Beach Group was to land supplies until a harbour could be captured. On 12 July, 20 Beach Group moved inland, behind the advancing infantry, but by 22 July the half-battalion was in the line, capturing Mount Scalpello. On 4 August, the half-battalion moved to Catania, where it remained on garrison duty.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn September 1943, the 21st Beach Group (\"C\" and \"D\" companies) invaded Salerno. The assault went in at dawn against stiff opposition and, rather than take its allotted role, the half-battalion was moved straight into the line. However, there was little action until 13 September, when the half-battalion was attacked by armoured half-tracks. This happened again on 15 September when \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun. However, the half-tracks didn\u2019t assault \u2018D\u2019 Company as such, they ran over the slit trenches until picked off by [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6pdr anti-tank guns]]. On 17 September, the half-battalion was moved back into reserve and, by 23 September, it was back on the beaches unloading cargo.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 136</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the two halves of the 2/4th Battalion were re-united at Pontecagnano near Salerno. However, there was no immediate employment, and orders were received to send cadres to the three battalions in the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] (this was rescinded after protests). However, six officers and 77 other ranks were posted away to form the \"2/4th Hampshire Training Centre\", three officers and 188 other ranks were assigned to \u2018porterage duties\u2019 and a detachment of 50 men was assigned to help the Provost Corps with traffic duties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 137</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was back in the line in Italy, near Garigliano, as part of [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade]], in [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in February 1944. This was the same ground where the Hampshire Brigade had suffered through the Italian winter. The battalion was relieved for short periods on a regular basis before returning to the line. In May 1944, the Battalion assisted the Brigade's two other battalions (2nd [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's]] and 2nd [[Somerset Light Infantry|Somersets]]) in crossing the River Rapido as part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]]. The river and bank were under intense enemy fire, and the river so swift that swimmers from 2/4th had to cross with lines to enable the boats to get across. Troops got across the river, but could make little headway against the storm of machine gun fire. The 2/4th could not get across to join their fellow battalions, and so, on 12 May, it came under command of [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Infantry Brigade]] and crossed via a bridge on 13 May. Supported by the [[17th/21st Lancers]]'s [[Sherman tank]]s, the 2/4th Battalion attacked along the river, taking 200 prisoners. On 14 May, back in ther 28th Brigade, the 2/4th attempted to cross the River Pioppeta. The tank bridge sank in the mud, and the battalion took 100 casualties in two minutes. The 2/4th waded the river and, in spite of heavy casualties and fierce resistance, the advance continued. During this advance, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Richard Wakeford]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. By 6.30pm, all objectives had been captured, and the 2/4th reorganised on a three-company basis. On 16 May, the battalion was relieved. Two days later, Cassino was captured by the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 171</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, the Battalion was back in the line near the village of Villastrada, between Lake Chiusi and Lake Trasimeno to north of Rome. On 24 June, a major attack was launched on that section of the Trasimene Line by 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry supported by the tanks of the [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12th Canadian Armoured Regiment]]. 2/4th Hampshires was to follow on, but its entry into battle was delayed until the next day. Having passed through the village of Vaiano, which was unoccupied, an attack was launched on a ridge being held by the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]]. Although \"C\" Company established a foothold on the ridge, occupying a farmhouse, that night a fierce German counter-attack was made by the Germans, who overran the company headquarters. Fighting was close and confused, and the company ran low on ammunition. It was forced back to literally the last ditch, but hung on. At dawn the next day, 26 June, the battalion counter-attacked and managed to recapture its previous positions; the Germans were withdrawing to the Arezzo Line. The 2/4th Battalion followed up, coming into action again on 21 July. Supported by the [[North Irish Horse]], a steady advance was made. The 2/4th Battalion was then taken out of the line again \u2013 some platoons were down to ten men each with no officer.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 176</ref>\n\nThe Battalion then attacked Santa Lucia, which was captured on 30 July 1944 after a small but fierce battle. The enemy then withdrew, and the Battalion moved up to the River Arno. On 10 August, the battalion was withdrawn. In September 1944, the Battalion began its assault on the Gothic Line, attacking across the River Marano and capturing Casa Bagli. All the first day objectives were achieved, and the 2/4th defended them on 16 September against German counter-attacks. On 17 September, the battalion captured Cerasola; it was relieved the following day. The battalion then moved north behind the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]\u2019s advance, arriving in time to stand by to support the Hampshire Brigade's assault on Forli during November. During 22 November, the 2/4th attacked and captured a bridgehead over the River Cosina against heavy shelling; this was the battalion's last action in Italy.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, the Battalion was flown to Greece in the bomb-bays of Wellington and Liberator bombers in response to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]], arriving on 12 December. The [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S. Army]], armed and trained by the British, was trying to overthrow the [[Greek Government]]. On arrival, the 2/4th Battalion was split up, primarily defending the airfield, then clearing E.L.A.S. forces from Athens. This did involve some fighting, and the 2/4th Battalion lost three men killed. The 2/4th Battalion then settled down to peace-keeping duties. In May 1945, the Battalion was moved to Crete to take charge of the Germans, who had surrendered, and they ended the war there.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 209</ref>\n\n====The 7th Battalion====\nThe 7th Battalion was a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, originally the 5/7th Battalion until it was split into the 5th and 7th battalions when the Territorial Army was doubled in size in the spring and summer of 1939. The 7th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom training long and hard for many years until after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\">Scott Daniell, p. 78</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was sent to Normandy as reinforcements with the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]] attached to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. In June 1944, the Battalion landed near Le Hamel. They were with 130th Brigade (with 4th and 5th [[Dorset Regiment|Dorsets]]) and were initially held in reserve. The Battalion [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|attacked Maltot]], supported by tanks of [[9th Royal Tank Regiment]] (9th RTR) in July 1944. The village was defended by [[Waffen-SS]] troops supported by [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s. Both the 7th Battalion and 9th RTR suffered severe casualties, and although the 7th Battalion managed to fight its way into the village it was withdrawn. The 7th Battalion suffered 18 officer and 208 other rank casualties, including 4 officers and 12 other ranks killed, but was back in the line two days later.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 233</ref>\n\nThe Battalion attacked the village of Cahagnes later in the month. This was fought in typical \u2018[[bocage]]\u2019 countryside, but after the initial attack by the brigade ran into difficulties, 7th Battalion deployed from reserves and captured Cahagnes, beating off several [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counter-attacks. On 2 August, the battalion moved up to Jurques, and after a short stiff fight advanced to \"Point 132\", close to [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mount Pincon]]. On 6 August, the battalion put in a deceptive attack on Mount Pincon, making a diversion whilst [[129th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|129th Infantry Brigade]] made a flank attack. During heavy fighting, 'C' Company incurred many casualties, including all the officers. Following the successful flank attack by the 129th Brigade, the 7th Battalion mopped up and concentrated near Mauny by 10 August.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 237</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the Battalion captured St Denis de Mere after a bombardment by nine artillery regiments. The Battalion took 74 prisoners and then prepared for \"The Breakout\". The Battalion then moved 50 miles north-east to Conches and, by 27 August, the 7th Battalion was across the River Seine. The battalion then participated in the capture of Tilly, and thereafter spent 11 days taking in replacements and resting. In September 1944, the Battalion started to move to Brussels for temporary garrison duty, arriving the next day. This easy duty was welcome; since landing in Normandy in June, the 7th Hampshires had lost (including wounded) 35 officers and 450 other ranks.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe Battalion fought in [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. On 20 September, the battalion moved through Eindhoven to Grave. The battalion was tasked with defending the southern end of the two large bridges over the Waal. On 23 September, the 7th was sent into the line, fighting west of the bridges in the Valburg-Elst area. It then moved to the \"Island\" and stayed there until 4 October, before moving to the Groesbeek-Mook area on the Dutch-German border.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn November 1944, the Battalion was moved to Maastricht, and then moved around as divisional reserve. On 19 December, the German launched their [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], which caused the 7th Battalion to move north of Liege to guard the bridges over the Meuse. On 26 December, the 7th Battalion moved to Aachen, and on 12 January moved again to Teveren. Then, in January 1945, the Battalion captured Putt, then Waldenrath, and on 25 January captured Dremmen and Porselen. The Battalion advanced south-east from Cleves as part of the big [[Operation Veritable|Reichwald offensive]]. Over two days fighting for Berkhofel, the 7th lost 70 casualties. It was relieved on 17 February.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 250</ref>\n\nThe Battalion [[Operation Plunder|crossed the Rhine]] in assault craft, consolidating on the far bank and then advancing across the IJssel Canal to Milligen, which was captured on 26 March. German resistance was collapsing, and the 7th moved over the Twente Canal on 1 April, liberating Hengelo. In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation \"Forward On\", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance. However, on 13 April, the Battalion had a hard fight for Cloppenburg, a fight that was as hard as any they had fought, vicious hand-to-hand fighting from street to street. Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the [[Royal Engineers]] and a single [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]], which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners. The 7th Battalion reached Gnarrenburg on 3 May, and were still there when the Germans surrendered the following day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 272</ref>\n\n====The Home Based Battalions====\nAlthough the Hampshire Regiment sent six battalions overseas, many more stayed at home as training units or were converted to other roles. Before the war, the 6th Battalion (Duke of Connaught's Own), Hampshire Regiment was converted into the 59th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, and upon the Territorial Army being doubled in size in 1939, formed a 2nd Line duplicate. The 59th Anti-Tank Regiment served with the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] and went with them to [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\"/>\n\nThe original [[Isle of Wight Rifles|8th Battalion (Isle of Wight Rifles)]], Hampshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and made into an artillery battery in 1937. However, a new 8th Battalion was formed, shortly after the war began, at Southampton in December 1939. It subsequently split into the 1/8th and 2/8th Battalions, before the 2/8th Battalion was renamed the 13th Battalion, and then both battalions were re-formed into the 8th Battalion again, which was subsequently renumbered the 30th Battalion and was disbanded in September 1942.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 79</ref>\n\nThe 9th Battalion was formed on the Isle of Wight in July 1940 and was later assigned to the [[201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]]. In 1942, the battalion was converted to armour as the 157th Regiment [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and assigned to [[36th Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Army Tank Brigade]]. Units converted in this way continued to wear their infantry cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.<ref>George Forty (1998), \"British Army Handbook 1939\u20131945\", Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50\u20131.</ref> However, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943 and 157 RAC was broken up in August, without having seen active service.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe 10th Battalion was formed in Aldershot in July 1940; it was assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 9th Battalion. In 1941, the 10th Hampshire was also transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, becoming the [[147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]], and was assigned to the [[34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Army Tank Brigade]].<ref>Forty pp. 50\u20131.</ref> Its [[Churchill tank]]s were named after Hampshire Regiment battles (the [[Commanding officer|CO]]\u2019s tank was called \"Minden\"). The regiment went to serve with distinction with 34th Tank Brigade in the [[North West Europe Campaign]] at Normandy, [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]], the [[Operation Veritable|Reichswald Forest]] and [[Operation Plunder]] from 1944 to 1945 .<ref>Forty p. 345.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Britain, 1941 H10633.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 12th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment in training at Hengistbury Head near Bournemouth, Dorset. Wearing his gas mask, a soldier advances through a smoke screen.]]\n\nThe 50th (Holding) Battalion, which was formed on the Isle of Wight in June 1940, absorbed the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]]. The Jersey Militia subsequently became the 11th Battalion, whilst the rest of the 50th Battalion became the 12th Battalion. The 11th Battalion stayed in the United Kingdom as a training battalion until the war ended, first with the [[209th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|209th Brigade]] and later with the [[135th (2/1st South Western) Brigade|135th Brigade]], [[45th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|45th (Holding) Division]]. The 12th Battalion also stayed in the United Kingdom, with the [[136th (2/1st Devon and Cornwall) Brigade|136th Brigade]], but was disbanded in September 1944 after sending a large final draft to the 7th Battalion serving in North-west Europe.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 84</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed in Southampton, but soon moved to Basingstoke. It was raised for those soldiers around the age of 18 or 19 who had volunteered for the Army but were not old enough to be [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]], the age being 20 at the time. However, the battalion was disbanded in July 1943 as the British government lowered the age of conscription for the [[British Armed Forces]] from 20 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://16dli.awardspace.com/page305.html|title=The Officers of the 70th Young Soldiers Battalion, DLI, October 1941|accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Regiment's Depot had been in Winchester since long before the Second World War. However, in September 1939, it moved to Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, where it stayed for the rest of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dalyhistory.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/portsmouths-ww2-dead-the-hampshire-regiment-in-focus/|title=Portsmouth\u2019s World War II dead: The Hampshire Regiment in Focus|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Post war and amalgamation===\nIn 1946, the regiment was awarded the title of '''Royal Hampshire Regiment''' in recognition of its service during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal corps and regiments - war service honours |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=10 December 1946}}</ref><ref>Army Order 167/1946</ref> The regiment was in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) in 1972 and undertook a further eight tours over the next two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-hampshire-regiment|title=Royal Hampshire Regiment|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> In 1992, as part of the [[Options for Change]] reorganisations, the regiment was merged with the [[Queen's Regiment]] to become the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23994.aspx|title=The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Regimental museum==\nThe [[Lower Barracks#Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum|Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum]] is based at [[Lower Barracks]] in [[Winchester]].

The 4th Edition rules were released in March, 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nGameplay takes place over a series of turns, with players alternating movement, shooting and close assault. This simple sequence of play, often called \"I-Go, You-go\", helps people who are unfamiliar with wargames or who are familiar with other games with a similar structure to quickly learn the rules. The game is optimised for two players, although it can be played by a larger number of players playing against each other or grouped in teams.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flames of War - Open Fire Rulebook |url=https://www.flamesofwar.com/Portals/0/Documents/OpenFire/Open-Fire-Quick-Start.pdf |website=Flames of War - Open Fire |publisher=Battlefront Miniatures}}</ref>\n\nPlay revolves around company-level tactics, with each stand or element representing an infantry [[fireteam]] (half-squad/[[section (military unit)|section]]), an artillery piece and its crew, or a single vehicle (such as a tank, jeep, or [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]). Air support is also available, in the form of fighter bombers (like the [[Hawker Hurricane]]) and ground attack aircraft (like the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] \"Shturmovik\"), with aircraft generally being represented by 1:144 scale models.\n\nThe main rulebook has numerous scenarios players can use for their games, with all of these scenarios centered on capturing objectives. Additional army sourcebooks contain further scenarios, usually centered on historical events relevant to that particular book. Game play utilizes six-sided dice to pass various skill tests used to shoot at enemies or pass motivation based tests. Movement distances and weapon ranges are provided in both inches and centimeters and are usually measured with tape measures or other measuring aides. [[Game piece (board game)|Tokens]] are used to indicate pinned down troops, bogged down vehicles etc.\n\nCurrent army sourcebooks are based on particular campaigns and include army lists for the German (Wehrmacht) forces (such as ''[[Afrika Korps]]'', [[Waffen SS]] and [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' ground troops]]), the U.S. Army (including [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] and Airborne units), the armies of United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]  (India, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand), the [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Union, (including the Soviet ''8ya Gvardeyskiy Strelkovy Korpus''), the Italian army (including elite ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' and ''Paracadutisti'', regular ''Fucilieri'', and fascist [[Blackshirts]] paramilitaries), as well as nations that played as smaller role such as the Poles, Hungarians, Finns, Romanians, as well as the Japanese and United States Marines for the Pacific Theatre campaign.\n\n''Flames of War'' provides players who are interested in World War II wargaming but lack an in-depth knowledge of the period with a \"one-stop shop\". The rulebook and sourcebooks provide not only the rules of the game and scenarios to play but also background material on historical forces and battles and simple guides to organising, assembling, and painting miniature armies.\n\n== Rules and sourcebooks ==\nBattlefront divides World War II into three periods. Early-war (1939\u201341), mid-war (1942\u201343) and late-war (1944\u201345). Each period has its own point values aimed at recreating actual battle situations that would have occurred during the respective time periods. Sourcebooks are compiled to represent forces from one of the time periods, some only cover specific battles (Blood, Guts, and Glory, Devil's Charge, etc.) other books cover broad campaigns with lists that span multiple years (North Africa, Eastern Front, etc.).\n\nTo play Flames of War you will need a Rulebook and a Source book containing Army Lists.  The current rules are found in the Fourth Edition Rule Book, of which there are actually two.  One covers the Early War and Late War periods and helps players effectively upgrade their Third Edition armies to Fourth Edition rules.  The other rulebook covers the Mid War period only and sourcebooks containing army lists have now been released to accompany this new Fourth Edition.  For tournament play, players are typically allowed to include either (depending on the tournament organizer)  Third edition source books and selected \"Web Briefings\" published on Battlefront's web site, or, Fourth edition source books during this period of transition.\n\n===Fourth Edition Rulebooks, Starter/Army box sets and Sourcebooks===\n* '''''Flames of War - Rule Book V4''''', released 2017, FW007 covers Mid-War period only.\n* '''''Flames of War - Rule Book V4''''', released 2017 Free, FW008 covers Early-War & Late-War period allowing players to upgrade Third Edition armies to Fourth Edition rules.\n\n====Early-War period Sourcebooks====\nNone have as of yet (Jan 2020) been released yet but you can still upgrade your Third Edition Armies by using the Fourth Edition Rulebook specifically covering the Early War and Late War periods.\n\n====Mid-War period Sourcebooks====\n* '''''Desert Rats''''' released in Feb 2017 covers North Africa British desert forces 1942-43, this was quickly superseded with the publication of Armored Fist\n* '''''Afrika Korps''''' released in Mar 2017 covers North African German desert forces 1942-43\n* '''''Avanti''''' released in Jan 2018 covers Italian North African desert forces 1942-43\n* '''''Fighting First''''' released in Dec 2017 covers U.S. Army forces in the North Africa desert Area 1942-43\n* '''''Armoured Fist''''' released in April 2018, supersedes Desert Rats and like that covers North African desert British forces 1942-43\n* '''''Iron Cross''''' released in late 2018, covers German forces at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] 1942-1943\n* '''''Enemy at the Gates''''' released in late 2018, covers Soviet forces 1942 though the Battle of Stalingrad 1942-1943\n*'''''Red Banner''''' released in early 2019, covers Soviet forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943\n*'''''Ghost Panzers''''' released in early 2019, covers German forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943\n\n====Late-War period Source Books====\n* '''''Armies Of Late War''''', released early 2018, covers the US, German, British, and Soviet forces.

But his marvelous design offers quite a lot, especially to those tabletop tacticians who long for a game where strategy is dominant, who want to dedicate more time to plotting a battleplan and less to worrying about the rules.

In the 1st Edition rulebook basic army lists were provided for the mid-war period (1942\u20131943), while Battlefront published early (1939\u20131941) and late war (1944\u20131945) army lists on their website (subsequently these early and late war lists were removed).  The 2nd Edition of the rulebook was published in 2006. The 3rd Edition of the rules was released on March 10, 2012. The 4th Edition rules were released in March, 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nGameplay takes place over a series of turns, with players alternating movement, shooting and close assault. This simple sequence of play, often called \"I-Go, You-go\", helps people who are unfamiliar with wargames or who are familiar with other games with a similar structure to quickly learn the rules. The game is optimised for two players, although it can be played by a larger number of players playing against each other or grouped in teams.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flames of War - Open Fire Rulebook |url=https://www.flamesofwar.com/Portals/0/Documents/OpenFire/Open-Fire-Quick-Start.pdf |website=Flames of War - Open Fire |publisher=Battlefront Miniatures}}</ref>\n\nPlay revolves around company-level tactics, with each stand or element representing an infantry [[fireteam]] (half-squad/[[section (military unit)|section]]), an artillery piece and its crew, or a single vehicle (such as a tank, jeep, or [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]). Air support is also available, in the form of fighter bombers (like the [[Hawker Hurricane]]) and ground attack aircraft (like the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] \"Shturmovik\"), with aircraft generally being represented by 1:144 scale models.\n\nThe main rulebook has numerous scenarios players can use for their games, with all of these scenarios centered on capturing objectives. Additional army sourcebooks contain further scenarios, usually centered on historical events relevant to that particular book. Game play utilizes six-sided dice to pass various skill tests used to shoot at enemies or pass motivation based tests. Movement distances and weapon ranges are provided in both inches and centimeters and are usually measured with tape measures or other measuring aides. [[Game piece (board game)|Tokens]] are used to indicate pinned down troops, bogged down vehicles etc.\n\nCurrent army sourcebooks are based on particular campaigns and include army lists for the German (Wehrmacht) forces (such as ''[[Afrika Korps]]'', [[Waffen SS]] and [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' ground troops]]), the U.S. Army (including [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] and Airborne units), the armies of United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]  (India, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand), the [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Union, (including the Soviet ''8ya Gvardeyskiy Strelkovy Korpus''), the Italian army (including elite ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' and ''Paracadutisti'', regular ''Fucilieri'', and fascist [[Blackshirts]] paramilitaries), as well as nations that played as smaller role such as the Poles, Hungarians, Finns, Romanians, as well as the Japanese and United States Marines for the Pacific Theatre campaign.\n\n''Flames of War'' provides players who are interested in World War II wargaming but lack an in-depth knowledge of the period with a \"one-stop shop\". The rulebook and sourcebooks provide not only the rules of the game and scenarios to play but also background material on historical forces and battles and simple guides to organising, assembling, and painting miniature armies.\n\n== Rules and sourcebooks ==\nBattlefront divides World War II into three periods. Early-war (1939\u201341), mid-war (1942\u201343) and late-war (1944\u201345). Each period has its own point values aimed at recreating actual battle situations that would have occurred during the respective time periods. Sourcebooks are compiled to represent forces from one of the time periods, some only cover specific battles (Blood, Guts, and Glory, Devil's Charge, etc.) other books cover broad campaigns with lists that span multiple years (North Africa, Eastern Front, etc.).\n\nTo play Flames of War you will need a Rulebook and a Source book containing Army Lists.  The current rules are found in the Fourth Edition Rule Book, of which there are actually two.  One covers the Early War and Late War periods and helps players effectively upgrade their Third Edition armies to Fourth Edition rules.  The other rulebook covers the Mid War period only and sourcebooks containing army lists have now been released to accompany this new Fourth Edition.  For tournament play, players are typically allowed to include either (depending on the tournament organizer)  Third edition source books and selected \"Web Briefings\" published on Battlefront's web site, or, Fourth edition source books during this period of transition.\n\n===Fourth Edition Rulebooks, Starter/Army box sets and Sourcebooks===\n* '''''Flames of War - Rule Book V4''''', released 2017, FW007 covers Mid-War period only.\n* '''''Flames of War - Rule Book V4''''', released 2017 Free, FW008 covers Early-War & Late-War period allowing players to upgrade Third Edition armies to Fourth Edition rules.\n\n====Early-War period Sourcebooks====\nNone have as of yet (Jan 2020) been released yet but you can still upgrade your Third Edition Armies by using the Fourth Edition Rulebook specifically covering the Early War and Late War periods.\n\n====Mid-War period Sourcebooks====\n* '''''Desert Rats''''' released in Feb 2017 covers North Africa British desert forces 1942-43, this was quickly superseded with the publication of Armored Fist\n* '''''Afrika Korps''''' released in Mar 2017 covers North African German desert forces 1942-43\n* '''''Avanti''''' released in Jan 2018 covers Italian North African desert forces 1942-43\n* '''''Fighting First''''' released in Dec 2017 covers U.S. Army forces in the North Africa desert Area 1942-43\n* '''''Armoured Fist''''' released in April 2018, supersedes Desert Rats and like that covers North African desert British forces 1942-43\n* '''''Iron Cross''''' released in late 2018, covers German forces at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] 1942-1943\n* '''''Enemy at the Gates''''' released in late 2018, covers Soviet forces 1942 though the Battle of Stalingrad 1942-1943\n*'''''Red Banner''''' released in early 2019, covers Soviet forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943\n*'''''Ghost Panzers''''' released in early 2019, covers German forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943\n\n====Late-War period Source Books====\n* '''''Armies Of Late War''''', released early 2018, covers the US, German, British, and Soviet forces.

But his marvelous design offers quite a lot, especially to those tabletop tacticians who long for a game where strategy is dominant, who want to dedicate more time to plotting a battleplan and less to worrying about the rules.

In March 2013 the first softback released through the Flames of War brand rather than Wargames Illustrated was released.

During the first two years of [[World War II]], the [[United States]] had maintained formal [[Non-interventionism|neutrality]] as made official in the [[Quarantine Speech]] delivered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1937, while supplying [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]] with war material through the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act]] which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|deploying the U.S. military]] to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces in Iceland]]. Following the \"Greer incident\" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the \"shoot on sight\" order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>Burns, James MacGregor (1970).

Stimson]], who mobilized the nation's industries and induction centers to supply the [[United States Army|Army]], commanded by [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]] and the [[Army Air Forces]] under General [[Hap Arnold]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], led by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], proved more autonomous. Overall priorities were set by Roosevelt and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], chaired by [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]]. Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe, but first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the sinking of the main battleship fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\nAdmiral King put Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], based in Hawaii, in charge of the Pacific War against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had the advantage, taking the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|Philippines]] as well as British and Dutch possessions, and threatening Australia but in June 1942, its main carriers were sunk during the [[Battle of Midway]], and the Americans seized the initiative. The Pacific War became one of [[island hopping]], so as to move [[Military airbase|air bases]] closer and closer to Japan. The Army, based in Australia under General [[Douglas MacArthur]], steadily advanced across [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] to the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Philippines]], with plans to invade the Japanese home islands in late 1945. With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil, as the U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within [[Air raids on Japan|bombing range of the Japanese home islands]]. [[Strategic bombing]] directed by General [[Curtis Lemay]] destroyed all the major Japanese cities, as the U.S. [[Battle of Okinawa|captured Okinawa]] after heavy losses in spring 1945. With the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], and [[Operation Downfall|an invasion of the home islands]] imminent, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]].\n\nThe war in Europe involved aid to Britain, her allies, and the Soviet Union, with the U.S. supplying munitions until it could ready an invasion force. U.S. forces were first tested to a limited degree in the [[Tunisia Campaign|North African Campaign]] and then employed more significantly with [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy in 1943\u201345]], where U.S. forces, representing about a third of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] deployed, bogged down after [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]] and the Germans took over. Finally the main [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]] took place in June 1944, under General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Meanwhile, the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] engaged in the area bombardment of German cities and systematically targeted German transportation links and synthetic oil plants, as it knocked out what was left of the [[Luftwaffe]] post [[Battle of Britain]] in 1944. Being invaded from all sides, it became clear that Germany would lose the war. Berlin [[Battle of Berlin|fell to the Soviets]] in May 1945, and with [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Death of Adolf Hitler|dead]], the [[Victory in Europe Day|Germans surrendered]].\n\nThe military effort was strongly supported by [[United States home front during World War II|civilians on the home front]], who provided the military personnel, the munitions, the money, and the morale to fight the war to victory. World War II cost the United States an estimated $341 billion in 1945 dollars \u2013 equivalent to 74% of America's [[GDP]] and expenditures during the war. In 2015 dollars, the war cost over $4.5 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp|title=US GDP|last=multpl|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAmerican public opinion was hostile to the Axis, but how much aid to give the Allies was controversial. The United States returned to its typical [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policy after the [[World War I|First World War]] and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s failure to have the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ratified. Although President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] personally favored a more assertive foreign policy, his administration remained committed to isolationism during the 1930's in order to ensure [[New Deal coalition|congressional support]] for the [[New Deal]], and allowed Congress to pass the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/american-isolationism|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> As a result, the United States played no role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of the war in September 1939, Congress allowed foreign countries to purchase war material from the United States on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis, but assistance to the United Kingdom was still limited by British hard currency shortages and the [[Johnson Act]], and President Roosevelt's military advisers believed that the Allied Powers would be defeated and that U.S. military assets should be focused on defending the [[Western Hemisphere]]. \n\nBy 1940 the U.S., while still neutral, was becoming the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" for the Allies, supplying money and war materials. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty U.S. [[Destroyer|destroyers]] for 99-year-leases to British military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and the [[Caribbean]].The [[Battle of France|sudden defeat of France]] in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to expand its armed forces, including the first [[Conscription in the United States|peacetime draft]]. In preparation of expected German aggression against the Soviet Union, negotiations for better diplomatic relations began between [[Undersecretary of State]] [[Sumner Welles]] and [[Soviet Ambassador to the United States]] [[Konstantin Umansky]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/us-soviet|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, America began sending [[Lend Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union as well as Britain and China.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Franklin D.

After the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], the United States articulated the [[Stimson Doctrine]], named for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], stating that no territory conquered by military force would be recognized.

Although under American law, it was illegal for United States citizens to join the armed forces of foreign nations and in doing so, they lost their [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]], many American volunteers changed their nationality to [[Canadians|Canadian]]. However Congress passed a blanket pardon in 1944.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/americans-in-the-royal-air-force/eagle-squadrons.aspx|title=Eagle Squadrons|accessdate= 19 April 2015}}</ref> American mercenary Colonel Charles Sweeny, living in [[London]], began recruiting American citizens to fight as a U.S. volunteer detachment in the [[French Air Force]], however France fell before this was implemented.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/> During the [[Battle of Britain]], 11 American pilots flew in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Charles Sweeney's nephew, also named Charles, formed a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] unit from American volunteers living in London.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/>\n\nOne notable example was the [[Eagle Squadrons]], which were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons made up of American volunteers and British personnel. The first to be formed was [[No. 71 Squadron RAF|No. 71 Squadron]] on 19 September 1940, followed by  [[No. 121 Squadron RAF|No. 121 Squadron]] on 14 May 1941 and [[No. 133 Squadron RAF|No. 133 Squadron]] on 1 August 1941. 6,700 Americans applied to join but only 244 got to serve with the three Eagle squadrons; 16 Britons also served as squadron and flight commanders. The first became operational in February 1941 and the squadrons scored their first kill in July 1941. On 29 September 1942, the three squadrons were officially turned over by the RAF to the [[Eighth Air Force]] of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and became the [[4th Fighter Group]]. In their time with the RAF the squadrons claim to have shot 73\u00bd German planes; 77 Americans and 5 Britons were killed.<ref>'Aces High', Shores and Williams, 1994, pages 31, 38, 40</ref>\n\nAnother notable example was the [[Flying Tigers]], created by [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer working in the [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]]. Officially known as the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) but nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers\", this was a group of American Pilots already serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|US Armed forces]] and recruited under presidential authority. As a unit they would serve in the Chinese Air Force to fight against the [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The group comprised three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each. The AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, twelve days after the Pearl Harbor attack. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded, and was replaced by the [[23rd Fighter Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which was later absorbed into the U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]]. During their time in the Chinese Air Force, they succeeded in destroying 296 enemy aircraft,<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\">Ford 1991, pp. 30\u201334.</ref> while losing only 14 pilots in combat.<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\"/>\n\n===Command system===\nIn 1942 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] set up a new command structure to provide leadership in the US Armed Forces while retaining authority as Commander-in-Chief as assisted by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] with Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in complete control of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] through its Commandant, then Lt. General [[Thomas Holcomb]] and his successor as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], Lt. General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], General [[George C. Marshall]] in charge of the [[United States Army|Army]], and in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]] on Marshall's behalf. King was also in control for wartime being of the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] under its Commandant, Admiral [[Russell R. Waesche]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy and as the chief policy-making body for the armed forces. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by Admiral [[William D. Leahy]], who became FDR's chief military advisor and the highest military officer of the US at that time.<ref>Henry H.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] victories in [[Battle of France|France]], [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] and elsewhere, combined with the [[Battle of Britain]], led many Americans to believe that some intervention would be needed. In March 1941, the [[Lend-Lease]] program began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by that fall) the Soviet Union.\n\nBy 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In spring [[U-boat|U-boats]] began their \"wolf-pack\" tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line; Roosevelt extended the [[Pan-American Security Zone]] east almost as far as [[Iceland]]. The US Navy's \"neutrality patrols\" were not actually neutral as, in practice, their function was to report Axis ship and submarine sightings to the British and Canadian navies, and from April the US Navy began escorting Allied convoys from Canada as far as the \"Mid-Atlantic Meeting Point\" (MOMP) south of Iceland, where they handed off to the RN.\n\nOn 16 June 1941, after negotiation with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], Roosevelt ordered the United States occupation of Iceland to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces]]. On 22 June 1941, the US Navy sent Task Force 19 (TF 19) from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to assemble at [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. TF 19 included [[Invasion of Iceland#Task Force 19|25 warships]] and the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] of 194 officers and 3714 men from [[San Diego, California]] under the command of Brigadier General John Marston.<ref name=\"morison\">{{cite book|title=The Battle of the Atlantic September 1939 \u2013 May 1943|author= Morison, Samuel Eliot|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1975|pages=74\u201379}}</ref> Task Force 19 (TF 19) sailed from Argentia on 1 July.

The agreement was for the US military to remain until the end of the war (although the US military presence in Iceland [[Naval Air Station Keflavik#Deactivation|remained through 2006]], as postwar Iceland became a member of [[NATO]]).\n\nAmerican warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had several hostile encounters with U-boats.  On 4 September, a German U-Boat attacked the destroyer {{USS|Greer|DD-145|6}} off Iceland. A week later Roosevelt ordered American warships to attack U-boats on sight.

This was because two of the Allied capitals, London and [[Moscow]], could be directly threatened by Germany, but none of the major Allied capitals were threatened by Japan.\nGermany was the United Kingdom's primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940, which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of [[Western Europe]], leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany's planned invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain. At the same time, war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the U.S. was not yet at war with either Germany or Japan, it met with the UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies.\n\nIn the 29 March 1941 report of the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 conference]], the Americans and British agreed that their strategic objectives were: (1) \"The early defeat of Germany as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European area; and (2) A strategic defensive in the [[Far East]].\"\nThus, the Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of \"Europe first\" (or \"Germany first\") in carrying out military operations in World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might crush both the Soviet Union and Britain, and would then become an unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United States by Japan at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, did not result in a change in U.S. policy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill hastened to Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to ensure that the Americans didn't have second thoughts about Europe First. The two countries reaffirmed that, \"notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime enemy. And her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow.\"\n\n===Battle of the Atlantic===\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, running from 1939 to the defeat of Germany in 1945. At its core was the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u20131945)|Allied naval blockade of Germany]], announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German navy) and aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) against the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, the United States Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from [[North America]] and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:American troops on board a landing craft heading for the beaches at Oran in Algeria during Operation 'Torch', November 1942. A12661.jpg|thumb|American troops on board a landing craft going in to land at Oran.

General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] commanded the assault on [[North Africa]], and Major General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] struck at [[Casablanca]].\n\n===Allied victory in North Africa===\n{{Main|North African Campaign}}\n\nThe United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Early in 1943, the [[U.S. Army]] suffered a near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] in February. The senior Allied leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering between American General [[Lloyd Fredendall]] and the British led to mistrust and little communication, causing inadequate troop placements.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081444/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3723/is_200303/ai_n9222724 \"Command Failures: Lessons Learned from Lloyd R. Fredendall\"] Steven L. Ossad, findarticles.com</ref>  The defeat could be considered a major turning point, however, because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General Patton.\n\nSlowly the Allies stopped the German advance in [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and by March were pushing back. In mid April, under British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the Allies smashed through the [[Mareth Line]] and broke the Axis defense in North Africa. On 13 May 1943, Axis troops in North Africa surrendered, leaving behind 275,000 men. Allied efforts turned towards Sicily and Italy.\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|300px|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\n\n===Invasion of Sicily and Italy===\n{{Main|Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of Italy}}\n\nThe first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was invading Europe through Italy. Launched on 9 July 1943, Operation Husky was, at the time, the largest [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operation ever undertaken. The American seaborne assault by the [[U.S. 7th Army]]  landed on the southern coast of Sicily between the town of Licata in the west, and Scoglitti in the east and units of the 82nd airborne division parachuted ahead of landings. Despite the elements, the operation was a success and the Allies immediately began exploiting their gains. On 11 August, seeing that the battle was lost, the German and Italian commanders began evacuating their forces from Sicily to Italy. On 17 August, the Allies were in control of the island, U.S. 7th Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 killed or missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured).\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in Sicily, Italian public sentiment swung against the war and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. He was dismissed from office by the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]] and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be slight. The first Allied troops landed on the Italian peninsula on 3 September 1943 and Italy surrendered on 8 September, however the [[Italian Social Republic]] was established soon afterwards. The first American troops landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, by [[U.S. 5th Army]], however, German troops in Italy were prepared and after the Allied troops at Salerno had consolidated their beachhead, The Germans launched fierce counterattacks. However, they failed to destroy the beachhead and retreated on 16 September and in October 1943 began preparing a series of defensive lines across central Italy. The US 5th Army and other Allied armies broke through the first two lines ([[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line]]) in October and November 1943. As winter approached, the Allies made slow progress due to the weather and the difficult terrain against the heavily defended German Winter Line; they did however manage to break through the [[Bernhardt Line]] in January 1944. By early 1944 the Allied attention had turned to the western front and the Allies were taking heavy losses trying to break through the Winter Line at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The Allies landed at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] on 22 January 1944 with the aim of outflanking the Gustav line and pulling Axis forces out of it so other allied armies could breakthrough. After slow progress, the Germans counterattacked in February but failed to stamp out the Allies; after months of stalemate, the Allies broke out in May 1944 and Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, the equivalent of seven US and French divisions were pulled out of Italy to participate in Operation Dragoon: the allied landings in southern France; despite this, the remaining US forces in Italy with other Allied forces pushed up to the [[Gothic line]] in northern Italy, the last major defensive line. From August 1944 to March 1945 the Allies managed to breach the formidable defenses but they narrowly failed to break out into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather closed in and made further progress impossible. In April 1945 the Allies broke through the remaining Axis positions in [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Operation Grapeshot]] ending the Italian Campaign on 2 May 1945; US forces in mainland Italy suffered between 114,000 and over 119,000 casualties.\n\n===Strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|Air warfare of World War II#United States: Army Air Forces}}\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|B-17s in flight]]\n[[File:James H. Doolittle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|Maj. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]], 8th Air Force Commander from January 1944 to V-E Day]]\n[[File:North American P-51 Mustang.JPG|thumb|North American P-51 Mustang, 26 July 1944]]\n[[File:Republic P-47D-22-RE Thunderbolt (sn 42-25969).jpg|thumb|Republic P-47D Thunderbolt, 1943]]\n{{stack end}}\n\nNumerous bombing runs were launched by the United States aimed at the industrial heart of Germany. Using the high altitude [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], it was necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be accurate. As adequate fighter escort was rarely available, the bombers would fly [[Combat box|in tight, box formations]], allowing each bomber to provide overlapping [[Browning M2|machine-gun]] fire for defense. The tight formations made it impossible to evade fire from ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters, however, and American bomber crew losses were high. One such example was the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], which resulted in staggering losses of men and equipment. The introduction of the revered [[P-51 Mustang]], which had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany's heartland, helped to reduce losses later in the war.\n\nIn mid-1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the [[English Channel]]. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth Air Force's]] B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns, and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, DC, and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"precision bombing\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, airfields, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed [[RAF Bomber Command]] operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief of the British Air Staff MRAF Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\", At the beginning of the combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943 669 RAF and 303 USAAF heavy bombers were available.\n\nIn the late 1943, the 'Pointblank' attacks manifested themselves in the infamous Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the P-51 Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X|H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point. The only offensive ordnance possessed by the USAAF that was guidable, the VB-1 [[Azon]], saw very limited service in both Europe and in the [[CBI Theater]] late in the war.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the Allied strategic bombing campaign\u2014resource allocation.\nFor the sake of improving the US air-force Fire bombing capabilities a mock-up German Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Fire bombing attacks proved quite successful, in a single 1943 attack on Hamburg roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and practically the entire city destroyed.\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe|United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the Combined Bomber Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the Luftwaffe in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.\n\nThe dismissal of General [[Ira Eaker]] at the end of 1943 as commander of the [[Eighth Air Force]] and his replacement by American aviation legend, Maj. Gen [[Jimmy Doolittle]] signaled a change in how the American bombing effort went forward over Europe. Doolittle's major influence on the European air war occurred early in the year when he changed the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With his permission, initially performed with [[P-38]]s and [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]s with both previous types being  steadily replaced with the long-ranged [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]s as the spring of 1944 wore on, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], who delegated command to his deputy in [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including Winston Churchill, Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the [[Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities such as [[Hamburg]], [[Kassel]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Operation Overlord===\n[[File:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|General Eisenhower speaks with members of the 101st Airborne Division on the evening of 5 June 1944]]\n[[File:Approaching Omaha.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|American troops approaching Omaha Beach]]\n[[File:2nd Infantry Division, E-1 draw, Easy Red sector, Omaha Beach, D+1, June 7, 1944.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|[[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] troops and equipment going up the bluff from Omaha Beach to [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] on D+1, June 7, 1944.]]\n[[File:Germanprisonerscherbourg.jpg|thumb|250px|German prisoners of war escorted by American soldiers in Cherbourg, 1944.]]\n{{Main|Operation Overlord}}\nThe second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally opened on 6 June 1944, when the Allies launched an [[invasion of Normandy]].\nSupreme Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower had delayed the attack because of bad weather, but finally the largest amphibious assault in history began.\n\nAfter prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the Army Air Forces, 225 [[U.S. Army Rangers]] scaled the cliffs at [[Pointe du Hoc]] under intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could have threatened the amphibious landings. Also prior to the main amphibious assault, the American [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], in an effort to protect the coming landings. Many of the [[paratrooper]]s were not dropped on their intended landing zones and were scattered throughout Normandy.\n\nAs the paratroops fought their way through the [[hedgerow]]s, the main amphibious landings began. The Americans came ashore at the beaches codenamed '[[Omaha Beach|Omaha]]' and '[[Utah Beach|Utah]]'. The landing craft bound for Utah, as with so many other units, went off course, coming ashore two kilometers off target. The [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]] faced weak resistance during the landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting their way towards the coast.\n\nAt Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with [[land mine]]s, [[Czech hedgehog]]s and [[Belgian Gate]]s in anticipation of the invasion. Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach. However, the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the invasion. As a result, the soldiers from the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]] and [[U.S. 29th Infantry Division|29th]] Infantry Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after leaving their landing craft. In some instances, entire landing craft full of men were mowed down by the well-positioned German defenses. As the casualties mounted, the soldiers formed impromptu units and advanced inland.\n\nThe small units then fought their way through the minefields that were in between the Nazi machine-gun bunkers. After squeezing through, they then attacked the bunkers from the rear, allowing more men to come safely ashore.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties. [[Omaha Beach]] is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, during World War II. The beach is located on the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) long, from east of [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to west of [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] on the right bank of the [[Douve|Douve River]] estuary. Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach]], thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the [[Baie de la Seine|Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy and elements of the British Royal Navy.\n \nOn D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran 1st Infantry Division and nine companies of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], were to assault the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n \nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five miles (eight kilometers) depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire (river)|Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] landing at Utah Beach. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division]], a large portion of whom were teenagers, though they were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front. The 352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training. Of the 12,020 men of the division, only 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a 53-kilometer-long (33-mile) front. The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast\u2014the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line. Nevertheless, Allied calculations indicated that Omaha's defenses were three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle of Kwajalein, and its defenders were four times as many.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days\uff0e\n\nWith the Beaches secured, the Allies needed to secure a deep-water port to allow reinforcements to be brought in, with American forces at the base of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] the target was [[Battle of Cherbourg|Cherbourg]], at the end of the Cotentin. The US [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] immediately began making their push after the beaches were secured on 6 June, facing mix of weak regiments and battlegroups from several divisions who used the [[bocage]] terrain, flooded fields and narrow roads to their advantage which slowed the American advance. After being reinforced, VII corps took control of the peninsula in fierce fighting on 19 June and launched their assault on Cherbourg on 22 June. The German garrison surrendered on 29 June, but by this time they had destroyed the port facilities, which were not made fully operational until September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=185\u2013193}}\n\n===Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 ===\n{{Main|Battle of Saint-L\u00f4}}\nThe Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 is one of the three conflicts in the Battle of the Hedgerows (fr), which took place between 9\u201324 July 1944, just before Operation Cobra. Saint-L\u00f4 had fallen to Germany in 1940, and, after the Invasion of Normandy, the Americans targeted the city, as it served as a strategic crossroads. American bombardments caused heavy damage (up to 95% of the city was destroyed) and a high number of casualties, which resulted in the martyr city being called \"The Capital of Ruins\", popularized in a report by Samuel Beckett\n\n===Battle of Carentan ===\n{{Main|Battle of Carentan}}\nThe Battle of Carentan was an engagement between airborne forces of the United States Army and the German Wehrmacht during the Battle of Normandy. The battle took place between 10\u201315 June 1944, on the approaches to and within the city of [[Carentan]], France.\n\nThe objective of the attacking American forces was consolidation of the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force attempted to hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-P\u00e9riers that would cut off the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].\n\nCarentan was defended by two battalions of Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Regiment 6 (6th Parachute Regiment) of the 2nd Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Division and two Ost battalions. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, ordered to reinforce Carentan, was delayed by transport shortages and attacks by Allied aircraft. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on 6 June as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on 10\u201311 June. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on 12 June. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on 13 June. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A (CCA) of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division\n\n===Operation Cobra===\n{{Main|Operation Cobra}}\nAfter the amphibious assault, the Allied forces remained stalled in Normandy for some time, advancing much more slowly than expected with close-fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows. However, with Operation Cobra, launched on 24 July with mostly American troops, the Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into France with fast-moving armored divisions. This led to a major defeat for the Germans, with 400,000 soldiers trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]], and the capture of Paris on 25 August.\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOperation L\u00fcttich was a code name given to a German counter-attack during the Battle of Normandy, which took place around the American positions near Mortain from 7\u201313 August 1944. (L\u00fcttich is the German name for the city of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I.) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counter-offensive.\n\nThe assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler, to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.\n\nThe main German striking force was the [[XLVII Panzer Corps]], with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Wehrmacht Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack.[2] Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.\n\nAs the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armored reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.\n\n===Falaise Pocket===\n{{main|Falaise Pocket}}\nFollowing Operation Cobra, the American breakout from the Normandy beachhead, rapid advances were made to the south and south-east by the [[United States Army Central|Third U.S. Army]] under the command of General George Patton. Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9|Caumont]] and [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the commander of [[Army Group B]], was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at [[Mortain]] against the U.S. breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First U.S. Army. Operation L\u00fcttich was a disaster, which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.\n\nOn 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise\u2013Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm, the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] the base and the [[First Canadian Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17\u201319 August, and the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armored Division]] on [[Hill 262]], a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with c.\u200950,000 Germans trapped inside. Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge. Two days later the Allied Liberation of Paris was completed and on 30 August, the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended Operation Overlord.\n\n===Operation Dragoon===\n{{main|Operation Dragoon}}\nOn 15 August 1944, the [[Seventh United States Army|US 7th Army]], spearheaded by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] and other Allied forces landed in southern France between [[Cannes]] and [[Hy\u00e8res]]. The aim of the operation was to secure the southern half of France and one objective in particular was to capture [[Marseille]] as a main supply harbor for the Allies in France. The operation was a success and forced the German [[Army Group G]] to abandon southern France and to retreat under constant Allied attacks to the [[Vosges Mountains]]. By the time the operation finished on 14 September 1944, US forces suffered 2,050 killed, captured or missing 7,750 other casualties, on 15 September 1944 the Allied forces of the operation were renamed the [[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth Army Group]] and placed under Eisenhower's command.\n\n===Operation Market Garden===\n{{Main|Operation Market Garden}}\n{{See also|Operation Market Garden order of battle}}\n\n[[File:Waves of paratroops land in Holland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paratroopers landing in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe next major Allied operation came on 17 September. Devised by British General Bernard Montgomery, its primary objective was the capture of several bridges in the Netherlands. Fresh off of their successes in Normandy, the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the Nazi-occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the [[Rhine]] and onto the [[Northern European Lowlands|North German Plain]]. Such an opening would allow Allied forces to break out northward and advance toward [[Denmark]] and, ultimately, Berlin.\n\nThe plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The 101st was to capture the bridges at [[Eindhoven]], with the 82nd taking the bridges at [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and [[Nijmegen]]. After the bridges had been captured, the ground force, also known as [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] or \"Garden\", would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops.\n\nThe operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the bridge furthest to the north at [[Arnhem]]. There, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne]] had been dropped to secure the bridges, but upon landing they discovered that a highly experienced German [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|SS Panzer unit]] was garrisoning the town. The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in respect to anti-tank weaponry and quickly lost ground. Failure to quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the bridge at Arnhem on the part of the armored [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], meant that the Germans were able to stymie the entire operation. In the end, the operation's ambitious nature, the fickle state of war, and failures on the part of Allied intelligence (as well as tenacious German defense) can be blamed for Market-Garden's ultimate failure. This operation also signaled the last time that either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war.\n\n===Operation Queen===\n{{Main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest|Operation Queen}}\nUnable to push north into the Netherlands, the Allies in western Europe were forced to consider other options to get into Germany. In the summer of 1944, the Allies suffered from a large supply crisis, due to the long supply route.  But by the fall of 1944, this has largely been resolved ([[Red Ball Express]]). As part of the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Siegfriend Line Campaign]], the Allies tried to push into Germany towards the Rhine. As a first step, [[Aachen]] was captured during a [[Battle of Aachen|heavy battle]]. The Germans now had the advantage of their old fortification system, the [[Siegfried line]]. During the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]], the Allies fought a long battle of attrition with the Germans, which ended initially in a stalemate, with the Allies unable to take the complete forest. The battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest was later absorbed by a larger offensive, [[Operation Queen]]. During this offensive, the Allies intended to push towards the Ruhr, as a staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the [[Rhine]] into Germany. However, against underestimated and stiffened German resistance, the Allies were only able to make slow progress. By mid-December the Allies were finally at the Rur, but by then the Germans had prepared their own offensive through the Ardennes, which was launched in the midst of an unsuccessful Allied attack against the Rur dams.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge|Battle of Bastogne|Operation Nordwind}}\n\n[[File:Wacht am Rhein map.svg|thumb|150px|The \"bulge\" created by the German offensive.]]\n[[File:American tank destroyers.jpg|thumb|150px|American tank destroyers move forward during heavy fog to stem German spearhead near Werbomont, Belgium, 20 December 1944.]]\n[[File:101st Airborne troops move out of Bastogne.jpg|thumb|150px|Troops of the 101st Airborne move out of Bastogne, after having been besieged there for ten days, 31 December 1944.]]\n\nOn 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a massive attack westward in the [[Ardennes]] forest, along a battlefront extending southwards from [[Monschau]] to [[Echternach]], hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and capture the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]. The Allies responded slowly, allowing  the German attack to create a large \"bulge\" in the Allied lines. In the initial stages of the offensive, American [[POW]]<nowiki/>s from the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] were executed at the [[Malmedy massacre]] by Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]].\n\nAs the Germans pushed westward, General Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne and elements of the [[U.S. 10th Armored Division]] into the road junction town of [[Bastogne]] to prepare a defense. The town quickly became cut off and surrounded. The winter weather slowed Allied air support, and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies. When given a request for their surrender from the Germans, General [[Anthony McAuliffe]], acting commander of the 101st, replied, \"Nuts!\", contributing to the stubborn American defense.<ref>[http://www.thedropzone.org/europe/Bulge/kinnard.html \"\"NUTS!\" Revisited: An Interview with Lt. General Harry W. O.

Patton then turned his army, at the time on the front in [[Luxembourg]], north to break through to Bastogne. Patton's armor pushed north, and by 26 December was in Bastogne, effectively ending the siege. By the time it was over, more American soldiers had served in the battle than in any engagement in American history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215114142/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12142004_2004121406.html \"Battle of the Bulge remembered 60 years later\".] defenselink.mil</ref>\n\nOn 31 December, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the war on the Western Front, [[Operation Nordwind]], in [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in northeastern France. Against weakened American forces there, the Germans were able to push the Americans back to the south bank of the [[Moder River]] on 21 January. On 25 January, Allied reinforcements from the Ardennes arrived, the German offensive was stopped and in fierce fighting the so-called [[Colmar Pocket]] was eliminated.\n\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and W\u00e4hrung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in favor of the Axis powers. Once accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theater of war.\n \nThe offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and [[Ultra]] indicated that a \"substantial and offensive\" operation was expected or \"in the wind\", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Soviet Front to the Ardennes and transport of forces by rail to the Ardennes was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by [[Peter Calvocoressi]] and [[F. L. Lucas]] at the code breaking center [[Bletchley Park]].\n \nNear-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of a heavy overcast, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] and in the south around [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] blocked German access to key roads to the west that they counted on for success. This and terrain that favored the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.\n \nWith about 610,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including 19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II.\n\n===Colmar Pocket ===\n{{Main|Colmar Pocket}}\nThe Colmar Pocket (French: Poche de Colmar; German: Br\u00fcckenkopf Elsa\u00df) was the area held in central [[Alsace]], France by the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] from November 1944 \u2013 February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group during World War II. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace. During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace.

On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the [[Battle of Aachen]] in October 1944 and by January had turned back the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German offensive exhausted much of Germany's remaining combat strength, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and had established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. During [[Operation Lumberjack]] and [[Operation Plunder]] in February\u2013March 1945, German casualties are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war.\n\n===South German Offensive===\n\nThe South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe. The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the [[1st Army (France)|First Army of France]]. Soviet troops linked up with American forces in [[Czechoslovakia]] notably in the [[Battle of Slivice]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps. However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress. However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction. The [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the Seventh Army linked up with the [[US Fifth Army]], which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into [[Austria]] and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east. Fighting continued a few days after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Surrender of Germany]] on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets.\n\n===Race to Berlin===\nFollowing the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes, the Allies pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany. With the capture of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]], the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945. The Americans then executed a [[pincer movement]], setting up the [[U.S. Ninth Army|Ninth Army]] north, and the [[U.S. First Army|First Army]] south. When the Allies closed the pincer, 300,000 Germans were captured in the [[Ruhr Pocket]]. The Americans then turned east, first meeting up with the Soviets at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe River]] in April. The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets on 2 May 1945.\n\nThe war in Europe came to an official end on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], 8 May 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii|title= World War II|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Historynet.com|publisher= |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pacific Theater==\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n{{See also|Asiatic-Pacific Theater}}\n[[File:Ww2-asia-overview.gif|thumb|350px|The conquests of Imperial Japan.]]\n\n===The Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|Explosion of the battleship {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} at Pearl Harbor.]]\n{{Main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\nBecause of Japanese advances in [[French Indochina]] and China, the United States, in coordination with the British and Dutch, cut off all oil supplies to Japan, which had imported 90% of its oil. The oil embargo threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt. Japan refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the United States was inevitable; its only hope was to strike first. President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] argued the only way to win the war was to knock out the powerful main American fleet immediately. His fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected. Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]] held tactical command. Over a five-hour period his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive-bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters. They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships, ten smaller warships, and 230 aircraft; 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed. Japanese losses were negligible\u201429 planes shot down (several American planes were also shot down by anti-aircraft fire). Commander [[Minoru Genda]], the chief planner of the raid, begged Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities, oil storage tanks, and submarines, and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly nearby. But Nagumo decided not to risk further action. To reach Pearl Harbor, they had to learn how to refuel at sea (a technique the US Navy already had worked out); to sink all those ships they used their electric torpedoes and shallow-water bombing tactics. Despite later rumors, there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan. The commanders had been complacent about routine defensive measures. In broader perspective, the attack was a failure. The lost battleships reflected obsolete doctrine and were not needed; the lost planes were soon replaced; the casualty list was short by [[World War II]] standards. Tokyo's calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a compromise peace proved wildly wrong\u2014the \"sneak attack\" electrified public opinion, committing America with near unanimity to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire.<ref>Gordon W.

The Japanese army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan peninsula. Roosevelt evacuated General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and the nurses, but there was no way to save the trapped men against overwhelming Japanese naval power. MacArthur flew to Australia, vowing \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return.\"  [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright]] surrendered on 8 May; the prisoners died by the thousands in the [[Bataan Death March]] and in disease-ridden Japanese prison camps where food and medicine were in very short supply.<ref>Donald J. Young, ''The Battle of Bataan: A Complete History'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe Japanese Navy seemed unstoppable as they seized the [[Dutch East Indies]] to gain its rich oil resources. The American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces were combined under the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]] command but its fleet was quickly sunk in [[Dutch East Indies campaign|several naval battles around Java]].\n\n===Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign===\n{{Main|Solomon Islands campaign}}\n\nFollowing their rapid advance, the Japanese started the Solomon Islands Campaign from their newly conquered main base at [[Rabaul]] in January 1942. The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and Guadalcanal, before they were halted by further events leading to the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. This campaign also converged with the [[New Guinea campaign]].\n\n===Battle of the Coral Sea===\n{{Main|Battle of the Coral Sea}}\n{{See also|Battle of the Coral Sea order of battle}}\n\nIn May 1942, the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on the other, nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other. It was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle. While indecisive, it was nevertheless a starting point because American commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war. These tactics proved immediately helpful at the battle of Midway only one month later. An excerpt from the Naval War College Review says that \"although the Coral Sea fight was a marginal tactical victory for the IJN [Imperial Japanese Navy], in terms of ships and tonnage sunk, it amounted to a small strategic triumph for the U.S. Navy.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hodge |first1=Carl Cavanagh |title=The Key to Midway: Coral Sea and a Culture of Learning|journal=Naval War College Review |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=121 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26397819?seq=3|jstor=26397819 |publisher=U.S. Naval War College Press }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Aleutian Islands===\n{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}\nThe Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between sovereign nations to be fought on America soil. As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway, the Japanese took control of two of the Aleutian Islands ([[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Island). Their hope was that strong American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway, enabling a Japanese victory. Because their [[ciphers]] were broken, the American forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway. On 11 May 1943, American and Canadian forces, spearheaded by the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Infantry Division]] landed on Attu, beginning the operation to take back the islands, by the end of May 1943 and after a series of battles, Allied forces retook Attu. On 15 August 1943, Allied forces landed on Kiska to retake it, only to find the Island abandoned by the Japanese.\n\n===Battle of Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n{{See also|Midway order of battle}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu burning on 5 June 1942 (NH 73064).jpg|thumb|250px|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiryu'']] burning after being attacked during the [[battle of Midway]]]]\n\nHaving learned important lessons at Coral Sea, the United States Navy was prepared when the Japanese navy under [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]] launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at Midway Island. The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the humiliation of the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo. Midway was a strategic island that both sides wished to use as an air base. Yamamoto hoped to achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island, followed by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the American carrier fleet. Before the battle began, however, American intelligence intercepted his plan, allowing [[Chester Nimitz|Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508131513/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/midway/midway.htm \"Battle of Midway, June 4-7, 1942\"] history.navy.mil</ref>  The battle began on 4 June 1942. By the time it was over, the Japanese had lost four carriers, as opposed to one American carrier lost. The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for the remaining duration of the war.\n\n===Island hopping===\nFollowing the resounding victory at Midway, the United States began a major land offensive. The Allies came up with a strategy known as [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|Island hopping]], or the bypassing of islands that either served little or no strategic importance<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1671.html \"Pacific Theater, World War II \u2014 Island Hopping, 1942\u20131945\"], USHistory.com.</ref> or were heavily defended but could be bypassed, such as [[Rabaul#World War II|Rabaul]]. Because air power was crucial to any operation, only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by the Allies. The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would be savage, as the Americans faced a determined and battle-hardened enemy who had known little defeat on the ground.\n\n====Air strategy====\n[[File:Lockheed P-38J Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|P-38 Lightning]]\nGeneral [[George Kenney]], in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur, never had enough planes, pilots or supplies.<ref>George Kenney, ''General Kenney reports: a personal history of the Pacific War'' (Office of Air Force History \u2013 1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Kenney+intitle:Reports+inauthor:kenney&hl=en&ei=ias7TsLSDqrSiAK0-pH3Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA full text online]</ref>   (He was not allowed any authority whatsoever over the Navy's carriers.) But the Japanese were always in worse shape\u2014their equipment  deteriorated rapidly because of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance. The Japanese had excellent planes and pilots in 1942, but ground commanders dictated their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any other mission could be attempted. Theoretically, Japanese doctrine stressed the need to gain air superiority, but the infantry commanders repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions. When Arnold, echoing the official Army line, stated the Pacific was a \"defensive\" theater, Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the offensive.  \"He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way. To defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to the punch.\"<ref>Quoted in [[William M. Leary]], ''We Shall Return!: MacArthur's Commanders and the Defeat of Japan'' (2004) p. 99</ref>\n\nA key to Kenney's strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings. He said a major shortfall was \"the kids coming here from the States were green as grass. They were not getting enough gunnery, acrobatics, formation flying, or night flying.\"<ref>Kenney p 112</ref>  So he set up extensive retraining programs. The arrival of  superior fighters, especially the twin-tailed [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], gave the Americans an edge in range and performance. Occasionally a ripe target appeared, as in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] (March 1943) when bombers sank a major convoy bringing troops and supplies to New Guinea. That success was no fluke. High-flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships. Kenney solved that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped across the water and into the target.<ref>Martin W. Bowman, ''B-17 Flying Fortress Units of the Pacific War'' (2003) p. 59</ref>\n\n=====Building airfields=====\nThe goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields. AAF commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118,000 men; it operated in all theaters. Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers, blueprints, steel-mesh landing mats, prefabricated hangars, aviation fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move forward to the next challenge, while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps. Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old airfields, so new ones were built. Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield. Unlike the well-built German air fields in Europe, the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor siting, poor drainage, scant protection, and narrow, bumpy runways. Engineering was a low priority for the offense-minded Japanese, who chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination.<ref>Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, ''The Army Air Forces In World War  II: Vol 7: Services Around The World'' (1958) ch 10</ref>\n\n====Combat experience====\nAirmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was the case in Europe. Coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat fatigue (now called [[Combat stress reaction]]) would drastically reduce the efficiency of units. The men who had been at jungle airfields longest, the flight surgeons reported, were in a bad shape:\n::Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost all show chronic fatigue states. . . .They appear listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost masklike facial expression. Speech is slow, thought content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches, insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense of responsibility, and are hopeless about the future.\"<ref>Mae Mills Link and Hubert A.

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons. Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops, but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation. The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks. Marine pilots, like all aviators, fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops. On the other hand, the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own. Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield. The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards  ahead. In 1944, after considerable internal acrimony, Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out. At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party (ALP) not only requested air support, but actually directed it in tactical detail. The Marine formula increased responsiveness, reduced \"friendly\" casualties, and (flying weather permitting) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery. For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation, provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed-wing fighters or bombers, although the Army was allowed to have \nsome unarmed transports and spotter planes.<ref>Robert Lee Sherrod, ''History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II'' (1952)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Guadalcanal Campaign}}\n{{See also|Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle}}\n[[File:GuadLandingsLunga.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines debark from [[LCPL|LCP(L)s]] onto Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942.]]\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign pitted American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) against determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines. Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone. As happened time and again in the Pacific, the Japanese logistical support system failed, as only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there. Consequently, the 30,000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment, adequate ammunition and even enough food; 10,000 were killed, 10,000 starved to death, and the remaining 10,000 were evacuated in February 1943. In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive. Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history, underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe.<ref>Charles W.

They quickly captured [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]], and prepared defenses. In the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge|Battle of Bloody Ridge]], the Americans held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging what was left of the Japanese. After more than six months of combat the island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943.\n[[File:Casta-MAP Guadalcanal-battles3.jpg|thumb|Guadalcanal showing several Naval battles.]]\n\nMeanwhile, the rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides diving the victories.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942 \u2013 February 1943'' (1949)</ref> Following the Japanese victory at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] on 8\u20139 August, Admiral Fletcher withdrew his ships from around Guadalcanal. A second Japanese naval force sailed south and engaged the American fleet in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24\u201325 August, ending in a draw but forced the Japanese naval force to retreat. On 11\u201312 October 1942,  to disrupt Japanese attempts to reinforce and resupply their troops on Guadalcanal (nicknamed the \"Tokyo Express\"), a small US naval force attacked this supply lines at the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and succeeded. In support of the Japanese ground offensive in October, Japanese naval forces engaged and hoped to decisively defeat any US naval forces in the area of operation at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 25\u201327 October 1942, however the Japanese failed to decisively defeat US Navy. From 12\u201315 November 1942, the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] took place: Learning that the Japanese were trying to reinforce their troops for an attack on Henderson field, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship to prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal, the U.S. succeeded thus turning back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal. A small US naval force attempted to surprise and destroy the Japanese Navy were attempting to deliver supplies to their forces on Guadalcanal at [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] however it wasn't successful. The final naval battle took place between 29\u201330 January 1943, known as the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], US naval forces attempted to stop the Japanese Navy evacuating its ground forces from Guadalcanal, however the Japanese successfully forced the US Navy to withdraw, protecting the Japanese evacuation.<ref>Richard Overy, ''War in the Pacific'' (2010)</ref>\n\n====Tarawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Tarawa}}\n\nGuadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would fight to the bitter end. After brutal fighting in which few prisoners were taken on either side, the United States and the Allies pressed on the offensive. The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943, by the Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the Japanese lines of defense either sank, were disabled or took on too much water to be of use. The Americans were eventually able to land a limited number of tanks and drive inland. After days of fighting they took control of Tarawa on 23 November. Of the original 2,600 Japanese soldiers on the island, only 17 were still alive.\n\n====Operations in Central Pacific====\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|215px|Admiral [[William F. Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Allies started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Moving closer to Japan, the U.S. Navy decisively won the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and landing forces captured the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]] in summer 1944. The goal was building airbases within range of the new B-29 bomber aimed at Japan's industrial cities.\n\n====Liberation of the Philippines====\n{{Main|Battle of Leyte Gulf|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in  23\u201326 October 1944, was a decisive American victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in arguably the [[largest naval battle in history]]. Although the Japanese came surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans, at the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost. The battle was a complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte, which the U.S. Army had just invaded. The army forces were highly vulnerable to naval attack, and the Japanese goal was to inflict massive destruction. Two American fleets were involved, the Seventh and Third, but they were independent and did not communicate well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two American fleets and almost reached the beaches. However the Japanese communication system was even worse, and the Japanese army and navy did not cooperate, and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Battle for Leyte Gulf'' (1947)</ref>\n\nGeneral MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944. The grueling re-capture of the Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], and [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindanao]].\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[M4 Sherman|M4 Sherman tank]] equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker on Iwo Jima, March 1945.]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}\nThe Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it wanted bases for fighter escorts; it was actually used as an emergency landing base for B-29s. The Japanese knew they could not win, but they devised a strategy to maximize American casualties. Learning from the [[Battle of Saipan]] they prepared many fortified positions on the island, including [[Bunker|pillboxes]] and tunnels. The Marines attack began on 19 February 1945. Initially the Japanese put up no resistance, letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from [[Mount Suribachi]] and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded. Over the next 36 days, the Japanese were pressed into an ever-shrinking pocket, but they chose to fight on to the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 defenders alive. The Marines suffered as well, suffering 25,000 casualties. The battle became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate hand-to-hand combat.<ref>Joseph H. Alexander, ''Closing In: Marines in the Seizure of Iwo Jima'' (1994), short Marine Corps history [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Iwo/index.html online edition]</ref>\n\n====Okinawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\n[[Okinawa]] became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the Second World War. The island was to become a staging area for the eventual [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] since it was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the [[Mainland Japan|Japanese mainland]]. Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots caused the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 soldiers and 150,000 civilians. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Army and the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Strategic Bombing of Japan====\n[[File:39th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|B-29 Superfortress dropping 500 pound high-explosive bombs over Japan, 1945.]]\n{{main|Air raids on Japan}}\nThe flammability of Japan's large cities, and the concentration of munitions production there, made strategic bombing the favorite strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward. The first efforts were made from bases in China, where massive efforts to establish B-29 bases there and supply them over the Hump (the Himalayas) failed in 1944; the Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases. [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]], captured by the U.S. in June 1944, gave secure bases for the very-long-range B-29. The [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] boasted four 2,200 horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons of bombs 33,000 feet (high above Japanese flak or fighters), and make 3,500 mile round trips. However, the systematic raids that began in June 1944, were unsatisfactory, because the AAF had learned too much in Europe; it overemphasized self-defense. Arnold, in personal charge of the campaign (bypassing the theater commanders) brought in a new leader, brilliant, indefatigable, hard-charging General [[Curtis LeMay]]. In early 1945, LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics: remove the machine guns and gunners, fly in low at night. (Much fuel was used to get to 30,000 feet; it could now be replaced with more bombs.) The Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems were so ineffective that they could not hit the bombers. Fires raged through the cities, and millions of civilians fled to the mountains.<ref>John Olsen, ''A History of Air Warfare'' (2009) p 74</ref>\n\nTokyo was hit repeatedly, and during [[Operation Meetinghouse|the first massive fire raid of March 9\u201310, 1945]] suffered a conflagration of about 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) in area, that killed at least 83,000. On 5 June, 51,000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were burned out by 473 B-29s; the Japanese were learning to fight back, as 11 B-29s went down and 176 were damaged.<ref>Donald L. Miller, ''D-days in the Pacific'' (2005) p. 2222</ref> Osaka, where one-sixth of the Empire's munitions were made, was hit by 1,733 tons of incendiaries dropped by 247 B-29s.

Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks, workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories, and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.\n\nThe Japanese army, which was not based in the cities, was largely undamaged by the raids. The Army was short of food and gasoline, but, as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved, it was capable of ferocious resistance. The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace, the Kamikaze.\n\n====Kamikaze====\nIn late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective new tactic, the [[Kamikaze]] suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at American ships. The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the end of the war. Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because they could navigate; they were not Kamikazes, and they returned to base for another mission. The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had minimal training; however most were well educated and intensely committed to the Emperor.<ref>Syohgo Hattori, \"Kamikaze: Japan's Glorious Failure.\" ''Air Power History'' 1996 43(1): 14\u201327. {{ISSN|1044-016X}}</ref><ref>Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima, ''The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II'' (1994)</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|A \"Judy\" in a suicide dive against {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}.

Rielly, ''Kamikazes, Corsairs, and Picket Ships: Okinawa, 1945'' (2010)</ref> Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa in April 1945:\n:\"Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination. These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude, dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage. They tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, and came in at any altitude or on the water.\"<ref>quoted in Norman Friedman, ''U.S. naval weapons: every gun, missile, mine, and torpedo used by the U.S. Navy from 1883 to the present day'' (1982) p 93</ref>\n\nThe Americans decided the best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them out on the ground, or else in the air long before they approached the fleet. The Navy called for more fighters, and more warning, which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships, more radar picket ships (which themselves became prime targets), and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies. Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945, because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands. The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes, and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip, the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further. Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target, the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing. Japan's industry was manufacturing 1,500 new planes a month in 1945. However, the quality of construction was very poor, and many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets.\n\nExpecting increased resistance, including far more Kamikaze attacks once the main islands of Japan were invaded, the U.S. high command rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war, hoping it would make a costly invasion unnecessary.<ref>John Ray Skates, ''The invasion of Japan: alternative to the bomb'' (2000) p. 241</ref>\n\n====U.S. submarines in the Pacific====\n{{main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese Patrol Boat No.39 sinking after being torpedoed on 23 April 1943.jpg|thumb|A Japanese escort vessel sinking after being torpedoed by the {{USS|Seawolf|SS-197|6}}, 23 April 1943.]]\n\nU.S. submarines participated in the majority of naval battles in the Pacific theater, but the submarines were most decisive in their blockade of Japan, for which Japan was dependent on its sea transport to provide resources for its war effort.\n\nOn the afternoon of 7 December 1941, six hours after the Japanese attack, U.S. naval commanders in the Pacific were ordered by the U.S. Navy Chief of Staff to \"execute unrestricted air and submarine warfare against Japan\".<ref>Spector (1984), pp.478\u2013479; Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.106; Holwitt, Joel I.

This included reconnaissance U.S. submarines landed and supplied guerillas in Japanese occupied territory and carrying in commandos for missions such as the [[Makin Island raid]], they also rescued crews of aircraft which had been forced down over the ocean.\n\nAs a result of several key improvements in strategy and tactics, from 1943, Allied submarines waged a more effective campaign against Japanese merchant shipping and the IJN, in effect strangling the Japanese Empire of resources. By the end of the war in August 1945, U.S. Navy submarines sank around 1300 Japanese merchant ships, as well as roughly 200 warships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/submarines.htm|title=World War 2 Submarines|publisher=}}</ref> Only 42 U.S. submarines were sunk in the Pacific,<ref name=pigboats>Roscoe, Theodore.

A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate. As Japan was able to withstand the devastating incendiary raids and the naval blockade despite hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, President Harry Truman gave the order to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|drop the only two available atomic bombs]], hoping that such sheer force of destruction on a city would break Japanese resolve and end the war. The first bomb was dropped on an industrial city, [[Hiroshima]], on 6 August 1945, killing appropriately 70,000 people. A second bomb was dropped on another industrial city, [[Nagasaki]], on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender, killing approximately 35,000 people. Fearing additional atomic attacks, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945.\n\n[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] which occurred on 15 August 1945 marked the end of the United States' war with the Empire of Japan. Since Japan was the last remaining Axis Power, V-J Day also marked the end of World War II.\n\n==Minor American front==\n{{Main|China Burma India Theater}}\n\nThe United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India theater, such as the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) but nicknamed \"[[Merrill's Marauders]]\" after its commander; [[Frank Merrill]], it  was a United States Army [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] unit organized as light infantry assault units. In slightly more than five months of combat in 1944, the Marauders advanced 750 miles through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements, mostly behind enemy lines, with or in support of British Empire and Chinese forces in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] and suffered many casualties.

During the first two years of [[World War II]], the [[United States]] had maintained formal [[Non-interventionism|neutrality]] as made official in the [[Quarantine Speech]] delivered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1937, while supplying [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]] with war material through the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act]] which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|deploying the U.S. military]] to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces in Iceland]]. Following the \"Greer incident\" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the \"shoot on sight\" order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>Burns, James MacGregor (1970).

Stimson]], who mobilized the nation's industries and induction centers to supply the [[United States Army|Army]], commanded by [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]] and the [[Army Air Forces]] under General [[Hap Arnold]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], led by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], proved more autonomous. Overall priorities were set by Roosevelt and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], chaired by [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]]. Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe, but first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the sinking of the main battleship fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\nAdmiral King put Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], based in Hawaii, in charge of the Pacific War against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had the advantage, taking the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|Philippines]] as well as British and Dutch possessions, and threatening Australia but in June 1942, its main carriers were sunk during the [[Battle of Midway]], and the Americans seized the initiative. The Pacific War became one of [[island hopping]], so as to move [[Military airbase|air bases]] closer and closer to Japan. The Army, based in Australia under General [[Douglas MacArthur]], steadily advanced across [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] to the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Philippines]], with plans to invade the Japanese home islands in late 1945. With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil, as the U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within [[Air raids on Japan|bombing range of the Japanese home islands]]. [[Strategic bombing]] directed by General [[Curtis Lemay]] destroyed all the major Japanese cities, as the U.S. [[Battle of Okinawa|captured Okinawa]] after heavy losses in spring 1945. With the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], and [[Operation Downfall|an invasion of the home islands]] imminent, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]].\n\nThe war in Europe involved aid to Britain, her allies, and the Soviet Union, with the U.S. supplying munitions until it could ready an invasion force. U.S. forces were first tested to a limited degree in the [[Tunisia Campaign|North African Campaign]] and then employed more significantly with [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy in 1943\u201345]], where U.S. forces, representing about a third of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] deployed, bogged down after [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]] and the Germans took over. Finally the main [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]] took place in June 1944, under General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Meanwhile, the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] engaged in the area bombardment of German cities and systematically targeted German transportation links and synthetic oil plants, as it knocked out what was left of the [[Luftwaffe]] post [[Battle of Britain]] in 1944. Being invaded from all sides, it became clear that Germany would lose the war. Berlin [[Battle of Berlin|fell to the Soviets]] in May 1945, and with [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Death of Adolf Hitler|dead]], the [[Victory in Europe Day|Germans surrendered]].\n\nThe military effort was strongly supported by [[United States home front during World War II|civilians on the home front]], who provided the military personnel, the munitions, the money, and the morale to fight the war to victory. World War II cost the United States an estimated $341 billion in 1945 dollars \u2013 equivalent to 74% of America's [[GDP]] and expenditures during the war. In 2015 dollars, the war cost over $4.5 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp|title=US GDP|last=multpl|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAmerican public opinion was hostile to the Axis, but how much aid to give the Allies was controversial. The United States returned to its typical [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policy after the [[World War I|First World War]] and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s failure to have the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ratified. Although President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] personally favored a more assertive foreign policy, his administration remained committed to isolationism during the 1930's in order to ensure [[New Deal coalition|congressional support]] for the [[New Deal]], and allowed Congress to pass the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/american-isolationism|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> As a result, the United States played no role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of the war in September 1939, Congress allowed foreign countries to purchase war material from the United States on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis, but assistance to the United Kingdom was still limited by British hard currency shortages and the [[Johnson Act]], and President Roosevelt's military advisers believed that the Allied Powers would be defeated and that U.S. military assets should be focused on defending the [[Western Hemisphere]]. \n\nBy 1940 the U.S., while still neutral, was becoming the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" for the Allies, supplying money and war materials. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty U.S. [[Destroyer|destroyers]] for 99-year-leases to British military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and the [[Caribbean]].The [[Battle of France|sudden defeat of France]] in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to expand its armed forces, including the first [[Conscription in the United States|peacetime draft]]. In preparation of expected German aggression against the Soviet Union, negotiations for better diplomatic relations began between [[Undersecretary of State]] [[Sumner Welles]] and [[Soviet Ambassador to the United States]] [[Konstantin Umansky]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/us-soviet|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, America began sending [[Lend Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union as well as Britain and China.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Franklin D.

After the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], the United States articulated the [[Stimson Doctrine]], named for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], stating that no territory conquered by military force would be recognized. The United States also withdrew from the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] limiting naval tonnage in response to Japan's violations of the [[Nine-Power Treaty]] and the [[Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/mukden-incident|title=Milestones: 1921\u20131936 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Public opposition to [[Japanese militarism|Japanese expansionism]] in Asia had mounted during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] [[USS Panay incident|attacked]] and sank the [[Yangtze Patrol|U.S. Yangtze Patrol]] [[gunboat]] ''[[USS Panay (PR-5)|USS Panay]]'' in the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] while the ship was evacuating civilians from the [[Nanjing Massacre]]''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17110447|title=A Japanese Attack Before Pearl Harbor|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Although the U.S. government accepted Japanese official apologies and indemnities for the incident, it resulted in increasing trade restrictions against Japan and corresponding increases U.S. credit and aid to China.

Although under American law, it was illegal for United States citizens to join the armed forces of foreign nations and in doing so, they lost their [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]], many American volunteers changed their nationality to [[Canadians|Canadian]]. However Congress passed a blanket pardon in 1944.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/americans-in-the-royal-air-force/eagle-squadrons.aspx|title=Eagle Squadrons|accessdate= 19 April 2015}}</ref> American mercenary Colonel Charles Sweeny, living in [[London]], began recruiting American citizens to fight as a U.S. volunteer detachment in the [[French Air Force]], however France fell before this was implemented.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/> During the [[Battle of Britain]], 11 American pilots flew in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Charles Sweeney's nephew, also named Charles, formed a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] unit from American volunteers living in London.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/>\n\nOne notable example was the [[Eagle Squadrons]], which were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons made up of American volunteers and British personnel. The first to be formed was [[No. 71 Squadron RAF|No. 71 Squadron]] on 19 September 1940, followed by  [[No. 121 Squadron RAF|No. 121 Squadron]] on 14 May 1941 and [[No. 133 Squadron RAF|No. 133 Squadron]] on 1 August 1941. 6,700 Americans applied to join but only 244 got to serve with the three Eagle squadrons; 16 Britons also served as squadron and flight commanders. The first became operational in February 1941 and the squadrons scored their first kill in July 1941. On 29 September 1942, the three squadrons were officially turned over by the RAF to the [[Eighth Air Force]] of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and became the [[4th Fighter Group]]. In their time with the RAF the squadrons claim to have shot 73\u00bd German planes; 77 Americans and 5 Britons were killed.<ref>'Aces High', Shores and Williams, 1994, pages 31, 38, 40</ref>\n\nAnother notable example was the [[Flying Tigers]], created by [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer working in the [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]]. Officially known as the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) but nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers\", this was a group of American Pilots already serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|US Armed forces]] and recruited under presidential authority. As a unit they would serve in the Chinese Air Force to fight against the [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The group comprised three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each. The AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, twelve days after the Pearl Harbor attack. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded, and was replaced by the [[23rd Fighter Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which was later absorbed into the U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]]. During their time in the Chinese Air Force, they succeeded in destroying 296 enemy aircraft,<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\">Ford 1991, pp. 30\u201334.</ref> while losing only 14 pilots in combat.<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\"/>\n\n===Command system===\nIn 1942 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] set up a new command structure to provide leadership in the US Armed Forces while retaining authority as Commander-in-Chief as assisted by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] with Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in complete control of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] through its Commandant, then Lt. General [[Thomas Holcomb]] and his successor as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], Lt. General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], General [[George C. Marshall]] in charge of the [[United States Army|Army]], and in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]] on Marshall's behalf. King was also in control for wartime being of the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] under its Commandant, Admiral [[Russell R. Waesche]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy and as the chief policy-making body for the armed forces. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by Admiral [[William D. Leahy]], who became FDR's chief military advisor and the highest military officer of the US at that time.<ref>Henry H. Adams, ''Witness to Power: The Life of Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy'' (1985)</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed Marshall became the dominant voice in the JCS in the shaping of strategy.<ref>Grace P.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] victories in [[Battle of France|France]], [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] and elsewhere, combined with the [[Battle of Britain]], led many Americans to believe that some intervention would be needed. In March 1941, the [[Lend-Lease]] program began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by that fall) the Soviet Union.\n\nBy 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In spring [[U-boat|U-boats]] began their \"wolf-pack\" tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line; Roosevelt extended the [[Pan-American Security Zone]] east almost as far as [[Iceland]]. The US Navy's \"neutrality patrols\" were not actually neutral as, in practice, their function was to report Axis ship and submarine sightings to the British and Canadian navies, and from April the US Navy began escorting Allied convoys from Canada as far as the \"Mid-Atlantic Meeting Point\" (MOMP) south of Iceland, where they handed off to the RN.\n\nOn 16 June 1941, after negotiation with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], Roosevelt ordered the United States occupation of Iceland to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces]]. On 22 June 1941, the US Navy sent Task Force 19 (TF 19) from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to assemble at [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. TF 19 included [[Invasion of Iceland#Task Force 19|25 warships]] and the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] of 194 officers and 3714 men from [[San Diego, California]] under the command of Brigadier General John Marston.<ref name=\"morison\">{{cite book|title=The Battle of the Atlantic September 1939 \u2013 May 1943|author= Morison, Samuel Eliot|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1975|pages=74\u201379}}</ref> Task Force 19 (TF 19) sailed from Argentia on 1 July. On 7 July, Britain persuaded the [[Althing]] to approve an American occupation force under a U.S.-Icelandic defense agreement, and TF 19 anchored off Reykjav\u00edk that evening. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] commenced landing on 8 July, and disembarkation was completed on 12 July. On 6 August, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] established an air base at Reykjav\u00edk with the arrival of Patrol Squadron VP-73 [[PBY Catalina]]s and VP-74 [[PBM Mariner]]s. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] personnel began arriving in Iceland in August, and the Marines had been transferred to the Pacific by March 1942.<ref name=\"morison\"/> Up to 40,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed on the island, outnumbering adult Icelandic men (at the time, Iceland had a population of about 120,000.) The agreement was for the US military to remain until the end of the war (although the US military presence in Iceland [[Naval Air Station Keflavik#Deactivation|remained through 2006]], as postwar Iceland became a member of [[NATO]]).\n\nAmerican warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had several hostile encounters with U-boats.  On 4 September, a German U-Boat attacked the destroyer {{USS|Greer|DD-145|6}} off Iceland. A week later Roosevelt ordered American warships to attack U-boats on sight. A U-boat shot up the {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} as it escorted a British merchant convoy. The {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}} was sunk by {{GS|U-552}} on 31 October 1941.<ref>George W.

This was because two of the Allied capitals, London and [[Moscow]], could be directly threatened by Germany, but none of the major Allied capitals were threatened by Japan.\nGermany was the United Kingdom's primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940, which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of [[Western Europe]], leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany's planned invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain. At the same time, war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the U.S. was not yet at war with either Germany or Japan, it met with the UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies.\n\nIn the 29 March 1941 report of the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 conference]], the Americans and British agreed that their strategic objectives were: (1) \"The early defeat of Germany as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European area; and (2) A strategic defensive in the [[Far East]].\"\nThus, the Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of \"Europe first\" (or \"Germany first\") in carrying out military operations in World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might crush both the Soviet Union and Britain, and would then become an unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United States by Japan at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, did not result in a change in U.S. policy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill hastened to Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to ensure that the Americans didn't have second thoughts about Europe First. The two countries reaffirmed that, \"notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime enemy. And her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow.\"\n\n===Battle of the Atlantic===\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, running from 1939 to the defeat of Germany in 1945. At its core was the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u20131945)|Allied naval blockade of Germany]], announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German navy) and aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) against the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, the United States Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from [[North America]] and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:American troops on board a landing craft heading for the beaches at Oran in Algeria during Operation 'Torch', November 1942. A12661.jpg|thumb|American troops on board a landing craft going in to land at Oran.

General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] commanded the assault on [[North Africa]], and Major General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] struck at [[Casablanca]].\n\n===Allied victory in North Africa===\n{{Main|North African Campaign}}\n\nThe United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Early in 1943, the [[U.S. Army]] suffered a near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] in February. The senior Allied leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering between American General [[Lloyd Fredendall]] and the British led to mistrust and little communication, causing inadequate troop placements.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081444/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3723/is_200303/ai_n9222724 \"Command Failures: Lessons Learned from Lloyd R. Fredendall\"] Steven L. Ossad, findarticles.com</ref>  The defeat could be considered a major turning point, however, because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General Patton.\n\nSlowly the Allies stopped the German advance in [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and by March were pushing back. In mid April, under British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the Allies smashed through the [[Mareth Line]] and broke the Axis defense in North Africa. On 13 May 1943, Axis troops in North Africa surrendered, leaving behind 275,000 men. Allied efforts turned towards Sicily and Italy.\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|300px|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\n\n===Invasion of Sicily and Italy===\n{{Main|Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of Italy}}\n\nThe first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was invading Europe through Italy. Launched on 9 July 1943, Operation Husky was, at the time, the largest [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operation ever undertaken. The American seaborne assault by the [[U.S. 7th Army]]  landed on the southern coast of Sicily between the town of Licata in the west, and Scoglitti in the east and units of the 82nd airborne division parachuted ahead of landings. Despite the elements, the operation was a success and the Allies immediately began exploiting their gains. On 11 August, seeing that the battle was lost, the German and Italian commanders began evacuating their forces from Sicily to Italy. On 17 August, the Allies were in control of the island, U.S. 7th Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 killed or missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured).\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in Sicily, Italian public sentiment swung against the war and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. He was dismissed from office by the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]] and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be slight. The first Allied troops landed on the Italian peninsula on 3 September 1943 and Italy surrendered on 8 September, however the [[Italian Social Republic]] was established soon afterwards. The first American troops landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, by [[U.S. 5th Army]], however, German troops in Italy were prepared and after the Allied troops at Salerno had consolidated their beachhead, The Germans launched fierce counterattacks. However, they failed to destroy the beachhead and retreated on 16 September and in October 1943 began preparing a series of defensive lines across central Italy. The US 5th Army and other Allied armies broke through the first two lines ([[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line]]) in October and November 1943. As winter approached, the Allies made slow progress due to the weather and the difficult terrain against the heavily defended German Winter Line; they did however manage to break through the [[Bernhardt Line]] in January 1944. By early 1944 the Allied attention had turned to the western front and the Allies were taking heavy losses trying to break through the Winter Line at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The Allies landed at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] on 22 January 1944 with the aim of outflanking the Gustav line and pulling Axis forces out of it so other allied armies could breakthrough. After slow progress, the Germans counterattacked in February but failed to stamp out the Allies; after months of stalemate, the Allies broke out in May 1944 and Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, the equivalent of seven US and French divisions were pulled out of Italy to participate in Operation Dragoon: the allied landings in southern France; despite this, the remaining US forces in Italy with other Allied forces pushed up to the [[Gothic line]] in northern Italy, the last major defensive line. From August 1944 to March 1945 the Allies managed to breach the formidable defenses but they narrowly failed to break out into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather closed in and made further progress impossible. In April 1945 the Allies broke through the remaining Axis positions in [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Operation Grapeshot]] ending the Italian Campaign on 2 May 1945; US forces in mainland Italy suffered between 114,000 and over 119,000 casualties.\n\n===Strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|Air warfare of World War II#United States: Army Air Forces}}\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|B-17s in flight]]\n[[File:James H. Doolittle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|Maj. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]], 8th Air Force Commander from January 1944 to V-E Day]]\n[[File:North American P-51 Mustang.JPG|thumb|North American P-51 Mustang, 26 July 1944]]\n[[File:Republic P-47D-22-RE Thunderbolt (sn 42-25969).jpg|thumb|Republic P-47D Thunderbolt, 1943]]\n{{stack end}}\n\nNumerous bombing runs were launched by the United States aimed at the industrial heart of Germany. Using the high altitude [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], it was necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be accurate. As adequate fighter escort was rarely available, the bombers would fly [[Combat box|in tight, box formations]], allowing each bomber to provide overlapping [[Browning M2|machine-gun]] fire for defense. The tight formations made it impossible to evade fire from ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters, however, and American bomber crew losses were high. One such example was the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], which resulted in staggering losses of men and equipment. The introduction of the revered [[P-51 Mustang]], which had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany's heartland, helped to reduce losses later in the war.\n\nIn mid-1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the [[English Channel]]. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth Air Force's]] B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns, and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, DC, and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"precision bombing\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, airfields, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed [[RAF Bomber Command]] operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief of the British Air Staff MRAF Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\", At the beginning of the combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943 669 RAF and 303 USAAF heavy bombers were available.\n\nIn the late 1943, the 'Pointblank' attacks manifested themselves in the infamous Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the P-51 Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X|H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point. The only offensive ordnance possessed by the USAAF that was guidable, the VB-1 [[Azon]], saw very limited service in both Europe and in the [[CBI Theater]] late in the war.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the Allied strategic bombing campaign\u2014resource allocation.\nFor the sake of improving the US air-force Fire bombing capabilities a mock-up German Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Fire bombing attacks proved quite successful, in a single 1943 attack on Hamburg roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and practically the entire city destroyed.\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe|United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the Combined Bomber Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the Luftwaffe in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.\n\nThe dismissal of General [[Ira Eaker]] at the end of 1943 as commander of the [[Eighth Air Force]] and his replacement by American aviation legend, Maj. Gen [[Jimmy Doolittle]] signaled a change in how the American bombing effort went forward over Europe. Doolittle's major influence on the European air war occurred early in the year when he changed the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With his permission, initially performed with [[P-38]]s and [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]s with both previous types being  steadily replaced with the long-ranged [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]s as the spring of 1944 wore on, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], who delegated command to his deputy in [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including Winston Churchill, Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the [[Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities such as [[Hamburg]], [[Kassel]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Operation Overlord===\n[[File:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|General Eisenhower speaks with members of the 101st Airborne Division on the evening of 5 June 1944]]\n[[File:Approaching Omaha.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|American troops approaching Omaha Beach]]\n[[File:2nd Infantry Division, E-1 draw, Easy Red sector, Omaha Beach, D+1, June 7, 1944.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|[[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] troops and equipment going up the bluff from Omaha Beach to [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] on D+1, June 7, 1944.]]\n[[File:Germanprisonerscherbourg.jpg|thumb|250px|German prisoners of war escorted by American soldiers in Cherbourg, 1944.]]\n{{Main|Operation Overlord}}\nThe second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally opened on 6 June 1944, when the Allies launched an [[invasion of Normandy]].\nSupreme Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower had delayed the attack because of bad weather, but finally the largest amphibious assault in history began.\n\nAfter prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the Army Air Forces, 225 [[U.S. Army Rangers]] scaled the cliffs at [[Pointe du Hoc]] under intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could have threatened the amphibious landings. Also prior to the main amphibious assault, the American [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], in an effort to protect the coming landings. Many of the [[paratrooper]]s were not dropped on their intended landing zones and were scattered throughout Normandy.\n\nAs the paratroops fought their way through the [[hedgerow]]s, the main amphibious landings began. The Americans came ashore at the beaches codenamed '[[Omaha Beach|Omaha]]' and '[[Utah Beach|Utah]]'. The landing craft bound for Utah, as with so many other units, went off course, coming ashore two kilometers off target. The [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]] faced weak resistance during the landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting their way towards the coast.\n\nAt Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with [[land mine]]s, [[Czech hedgehog]]s and [[Belgian Gate]]s in anticipation of the invasion. Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach. However, the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the invasion. As a result, the soldiers from the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]] and [[U.S. 29th Infantry Division|29th]] Infantry Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after leaving their landing craft. In some instances, entire landing craft full of men were mowed down by the well-positioned German defenses. As the casualties mounted, the soldiers formed impromptu units and advanced inland.\n\nThe small units then fought their way through the minefields that were in between the Nazi machine-gun bunkers. After squeezing through, they then attacked the bunkers from the rear, allowing more men to come safely ashore.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties. [[Omaha Beach]] is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, during World War II. The beach is located on the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) long, from east of [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to west of [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] on the right bank of the [[Douve|Douve River]] estuary. Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach]], thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the [[Baie de la Seine|Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy and elements of the British Royal Navy.\n \nOn D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran 1st Infantry Division and nine companies of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], were to assault the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n \nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five miles (eight kilometers) depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire (river)|Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] landing at Utah Beach. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division]], a large portion of whom were teenagers, though they were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front. The 352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training. Of the 12,020 men of the division, only 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a 53-kilometer-long (33-mile) front. The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast\u2014the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line. Nevertheless, Allied calculations indicated that Omaha's defenses were three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle of Kwajalein, and its defenders were four times as many.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days\uff0e\n\nWith the Beaches secured, the Allies needed to secure a deep-water port to allow reinforcements to be brought in, with American forces at the base of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] the target was [[Battle of Cherbourg|Cherbourg]], at the end of the Cotentin. The US [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] immediately began making their push after the beaches were secured on 6 June, facing mix of weak regiments and battlegroups from several divisions who used the [[bocage]] terrain, flooded fields and narrow roads to their advantage which slowed the American advance. After being reinforced, VII corps took control of the peninsula in fierce fighting on 19 June and launched their assault on Cherbourg on 22 June. The German garrison surrendered on 29 June, but by this time they had destroyed the port facilities, which were not made fully operational until September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=185\u2013193}}\n\n===Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 ===\n{{Main|Battle of Saint-L\u00f4}}\nThe Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 is one of the three conflicts in the Battle of the Hedgerows (fr), which took place between 9\u201324 July 1944, just before Operation Cobra. Saint-L\u00f4 had fallen to Germany in 1940, and, after the Invasion of Normandy, the Americans targeted the city, as it served as a strategic crossroads. American bombardments caused heavy damage (up to 95% of the city was destroyed) and a high number of casualties, which resulted in the martyr city being called \"The Capital of Ruins\", popularized in a report by Samuel Beckett\n\n===Battle of Carentan ===\n{{Main|Battle of Carentan}}\nThe Battle of Carentan was an engagement between airborne forces of the United States Army and the German Wehrmacht during the Battle of Normandy. The battle took place between 10\u201315 June 1944, on the approaches to and within the city of [[Carentan]], France.\n\nThe objective of the attacking American forces was consolidation of the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force attempted to hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-P\u00e9riers that would cut off the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].\n\nCarentan was defended by two battalions of Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Regiment 6 (6th Parachute Regiment) of the 2nd Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Division and two Ost battalions. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, ordered to reinforce Carentan, was delayed by transport shortages and attacks by Allied aircraft. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on 6 June as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on 10\u201311 June. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on 12 June. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on 13 June. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A (CCA) of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division\n\n===Operation Cobra===\n{{Main|Operation Cobra}}\nAfter the amphibious assault, the Allied forces remained stalled in Normandy for some time, advancing much more slowly than expected with close-fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows. However, with Operation Cobra, launched on 24 July with mostly American troops, the Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into France with fast-moving armored divisions. This led to a major defeat for the Germans, with 400,000 soldiers trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]], and the capture of Paris on 25 August.\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOperation L\u00fcttich was a code name given to a German counter-attack during the Battle of Normandy, which took place around the American positions near Mortain from 7\u201313 August 1944. (L\u00fcttich is the German name for the city of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I.) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counter-offensive.\n\nThe assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler, to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.\n\nThe main German striking force was the [[XLVII Panzer Corps]], with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Wehrmacht Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack.[2] Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.\n\nAs the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armored reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.\n\n===Falaise Pocket===\n{{main|Falaise Pocket}}\nFollowing Operation Cobra, the American breakout from the Normandy beachhead, rapid advances were made to the south and south-east by the [[United States Army Central|Third U.S. Army]] under the command of General George Patton. Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9|Caumont]] and [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the commander of [[Army Group B]], was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at [[Mortain]] against the U.S. breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First U.S. Army. Operation L\u00fcttich was a disaster, which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.\n\nOn 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise\u2013Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm, the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] the base and the [[First Canadian Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17\u201319 August, and the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armored Division]] on [[Hill 262]], a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with c.\u200950,000 Germans trapped inside. Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge. Two days later the Allied Liberation of Paris was completed and on 30 August, the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended Operation Overlord.\n\n===Operation Dragoon===\n{{main|Operation Dragoon}}\nOn 15 August 1944, the [[Seventh United States Army|US 7th Army]], spearheaded by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] and other Allied forces landed in southern France between [[Cannes]] and [[Hy\u00e8res]]. The aim of the operation was to secure the southern half of France and one objective in particular was to capture [[Marseille]] as a main supply harbor for the Allies in France. The operation was a success and forced the German [[Army Group G]] to abandon southern France and to retreat under constant Allied attacks to the [[Vosges Mountains]]. By the time the operation finished on 14 September 1944, US forces suffered 2,050 killed, captured or missing 7,750 other casualties, on 15 September 1944 the Allied forces of the operation were renamed the [[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth Army Group]] and placed under Eisenhower's command.\n\n===Operation Market Garden===\n{{Main|Operation Market Garden}}\n{{See also|Operation Market Garden order of battle}}\n\n[[File:Waves of paratroops land in Holland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paratroopers landing in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe next major Allied operation came on 17 September. Devised by British General Bernard Montgomery, its primary objective was the capture of several bridges in the Netherlands. Fresh off of their successes in Normandy, the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the Nazi-occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the [[Rhine]] and onto the [[Northern European Lowlands|North German Plain]]. Such an opening would allow Allied forces to break out northward and advance toward [[Denmark]] and, ultimately, Berlin.\n\nThe plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The 101st was to capture the bridges at [[Eindhoven]], with the 82nd taking the bridges at [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and [[Nijmegen]]. After the bridges had been captured, the ground force, also known as [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] or \"Garden\", would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops.\n\nThe operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the bridge furthest to the north at [[Arnhem]]. There, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne]] had been dropped to secure the bridges, but upon landing they discovered that a highly experienced German [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|SS Panzer unit]] was garrisoning the town. The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in respect to anti-tank weaponry and quickly lost ground. Failure to quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the bridge at Arnhem on the part of the armored [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], meant that the Germans were able to stymie the entire operation. In the end, the operation's ambitious nature, the fickle state of war, and failures on the part of Allied intelligence (as well as tenacious German defense) can be blamed for Market-Garden's ultimate failure. This operation also signaled the last time that either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war.\n\n===Operation Queen===\n{{Main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest|Operation Queen}}\nUnable to push north into the Netherlands, the Allies in western Europe were forced to consider other options to get into Germany. In the summer of 1944, the Allies suffered from a large supply crisis, due to the long supply route.  But by the fall of 1944, this has largely been resolved ([[Red Ball Express]]). As part of the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Siegfriend Line Campaign]], the Allies tried to push into Germany towards the Rhine. As a first step, [[Aachen]] was captured during a [[Battle of Aachen|heavy battle]]. The Germans now had the advantage of their old fortification system, the [[Siegfried line]]. During the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]], the Allies fought a long battle of attrition with the Germans, which ended initially in a stalemate, with the Allies unable to take the complete forest. The battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest was later absorbed by a larger offensive, [[Operation Queen]]. During this offensive, the Allies intended to push towards the Ruhr, as a staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the [[Rhine]] into Germany. However, against underestimated and stiffened German resistance, the Allies were only able to make slow progress. By mid-December the Allies were finally at the Rur, but by then the Germans had prepared their own offensive through the Ardennes, which was launched in the midst of an unsuccessful Allied attack against the Rur dams.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge|Battle of Bastogne|Operation Nordwind}}\n\n[[File:Wacht am Rhein map.svg|thumb|150px|The \"bulge\" created by the German offensive.]]\n[[File:American tank destroyers.jpg|thumb|150px|American tank destroyers move forward during heavy fog to stem German spearhead near Werbomont, Belgium, 20 December 1944.]]\n[[File:101st Airborne troops move out of Bastogne.jpg|thumb|150px|Troops of the 101st Airborne move out of Bastogne, after having been besieged there for ten days, 31 December 1944.]]\n\nOn 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a massive attack westward in the [[Ardennes]] forest, along a battlefront extending southwards from [[Monschau]] to [[Echternach]], hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and capture the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]. The Allies responded slowly, allowing  the German attack to create a large \"bulge\" in the Allied lines. In the initial stages of the offensive, American [[POW]]<nowiki/>s from the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] were executed at the [[Malmedy massacre]] by Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]].\n\nAs the Germans pushed westward, General Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne and elements of the [[U.S. 10th Armored Division]] into the road junction town of [[Bastogne]] to prepare a defense. The town quickly became cut off and surrounded. The winter weather slowed Allied air support, and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies. When given a request for their surrender from the Germans, General [[Anthony McAuliffe]], acting commander of the 101st, replied, \"Nuts!\", contributing to the stubborn American defense.<ref>[http://www.thedropzone.org/europe/Bulge/kinnard.html \"\"NUTS!\" Revisited: An Interview with Lt.

Patton then turned his army, at the time on the front in [[Luxembourg]], north to break through to Bastogne. Patton's armor pushed north, and by 26 December was in Bastogne, effectively ending the siege. By the time it was over, more American soldiers had served in the battle than in any engagement in American history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215114142/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12142004_2004121406.html \"Battle of the Bulge remembered 60 years later\".] defenselink.mil</ref>\n\nOn 31 December, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the war on the Western Front, [[Operation Nordwind]], in [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in northeastern France. Against weakened American forces there, the Germans were able to push the Americans back to the south bank of the [[Moder River]] on 21 January. On 25 January, Allied reinforcements from the Ardennes arrived, the German offensive was stopped and in fierce fighting the so-called [[Colmar Pocket]] was eliminated.\n\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and W\u00e4hrung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in favor of the Axis powers. Once accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theater of war.\n \nThe offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and [[Ultra]] indicated that a \"substantial and offensive\" operation was expected or \"in the wind\", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Soviet Front to the Ardennes and transport of forces by rail to the Ardennes was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by [[Peter Calvocoressi]] and [[F. L. Lucas]] at the code breaking center [[Bletchley Park]].\n \nNear-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of a heavy overcast, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] and in the south around [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] blocked German access to key roads to the west that they counted on for success. This and terrain that favored the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.\n \nWith about 610,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including 19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II.\n\n===Colmar Pocket ===\n{{Main|Colmar Pocket}}\nThe Colmar Pocket (French: Poche de Colmar; German: Br\u00fcckenkopf Elsa\u00df) was the area held in central [[Alsace]], France by the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] from November 1944 \u2013 February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group during World War II. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace. During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace.

On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the [[Battle of Aachen]] in October 1944 and by January had turned back the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German offensive exhausted much of Germany's remaining combat strength, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and had established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. During [[Operation Lumberjack]] and [[Operation Plunder]] in February\u2013March 1945, German casualties are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war.\n\n===South German Offensive===\n\nThe South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe. The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the [[1st Army (France)|First Army of France]]. Soviet troops linked up with American forces in [[Czechoslovakia]] notably in the [[Battle of Slivice]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps. However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress. However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction. The [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the Seventh Army linked up with the [[US Fifth Army]], which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into [[Austria]] and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east. Fighting continued a few days after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Surrender of Germany]] on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets.\n\n===Race to Berlin===\nFollowing the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes, the Allies pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany. With the capture of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]], the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945. The Americans then executed a [[pincer movement]], setting up the [[U.S. Ninth Army|Ninth Army]] north, and the [[U.S. First Army|First Army]] south. When the Allies closed the pincer, 300,000 Germans were captured in the [[Ruhr Pocket]]. The Americans then turned east, first meeting up with the Soviets at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe River]] in April. The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets on 2 May 1945.\n\nThe war in Europe came to an official end on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], 8 May 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii|title= World War II|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Historynet.com|publisher= |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pacific Theater==\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n{{See also|Asiatic-Pacific Theater}}\n[[File:Ww2-asia-overview.gif|thumb|350px|The conquests of Imperial Japan.]]\n\n===The Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|Explosion of the battleship {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} at Pearl Harbor.]]\n{{Main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\nBecause of Japanese advances in [[French Indochina]] and China, the United States, in coordination with the British and Dutch, cut off all oil supplies to Japan, which had imported 90% of its oil. The oil embargo threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt. Japan refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the United States was inevitable; its only hope was to strike first. President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] argued the only way to win the war was to knock out the powerful main American fleet immediately. His fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected. Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]] held tactical command. Over a five-hour period his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive-bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters. They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships, ten smaller warships, and 230 aircraft; 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed. Japanese losses were negligible\u201429 planes shot down (several American planes were also shot down by anti-aircraft fire). Commander [[Minoru Genda]], the chief planner of the raid, begged Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities, oil storage tanks, and submarines, and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly nearby. But Nagumo decided not to risk further action. To reach Pearl Harbor, they had to learn how to refuel at sea (a technique the US Navy already had worked out); to sink all those ships they used their electric torpedoes and shallow-water bombing tactics. Despite later rumors, there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan. The commanders had been complacent about routine defensive measures. In broader perspective, the attack was a failure. The lost battleships reflected obsolete doctrine and were not needed; the lost planes were soon replaced; the casualty list was short by [[World War II]] standards. Tokyo's calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a compromise peace proved wildly wrong\u2014the \"sneak attack\" electrified public opinion, committing America with near unanimity to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire.<ref>Gordon W.

The Japanese army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan peninsula. Roosevelt evacuated General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and the nurses, but there was no way to save the trapped men against overwhelming Japanese naval power. MacArthur flew to Australia, vowing \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return.\"  [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright]] surrendered on 8 May; the prisoners died by the thousands in the [[Bataan Death March]] and in disease-ridden Japanese prison camps where food and medicine were in very short supply.<ref>Donald J.

The American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces were combined under the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]] command but its fleet was quickly sunk in [[Dutch East Indies campaign|several naval battles around Java]].\n\n===Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign===\n{{Main|Solomon Islands campaign}}\n\nFollowing their rapid advance, the Japanese started the Solomon Islands Campaign from their newly conquered main base at [[Rabaul]] in January 1942. The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and Guadalcanal, before they were halted by further events leading to the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. This campaign also converged with the [[New Guinea campaign]].\n\n===Battle of the Coral Sea===\n{{Main|Battle of the Coral Sea}}\n{{See also|Battle of the Coral Sea order of battle}}\n\nIn May 1942, the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on the other, nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other. It was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle. While indecisive, it was nevertheless a starting point because American commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war. These tactics proved immediately helpful at the battle of Midway only one month later. An excerpt from the Naval War College Review says that \"although the Coral Sea fight was a marginal tactical victory for the IJN [Imperial Japanese Navy], in terms of ships and tonnage sunk, it amounted to a small strategic triumph for the U.S. Navy.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hodge |first1=Carl Cavanagh |title=The Key to Midway: Coral Sea and a Culture of Learning|journal=Naval War College Review |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=121 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26397819?seq=3|jstor=26397819 |publisher=U.S. Naval War College Press }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Aleutian Islands===\n{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}\nThe Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between sovereign nations to be fought on America soil. As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway, the Japanese took control of two of the Aleutian Islands ([[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Island). Their hope was that strong American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway, enabling a Japanese victory. Because their [[ciphers]] were broken, the American forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway. On 11 May 1943, American and Canadian forces, spearheaded by the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Infantry Division]] landed on Attu, beginning the operation to take back the islands, by the end of May 1943 and after a series of battles, Allied forces retook Attu. On 15 August 1943, Allied forces landed on Kiska to retake it, only to find the Island abandoned by the Japanese.\n\n===Battle of Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n{{See also|Midway order of battle}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu burning on 5 June 1942 (NH 73064).jpg|thumb|250px|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiryu'']] burning after being attacked during the [[battle of Midway]]]]\n\nHaving learned important lessons at Coral Sea, the United States Navy was prepared when the Japanese navy under [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]] launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at Midway Island. The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the humiliation of the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo. Midway was a strategic island that both sides wished to use as an air base. Yamamoto hoped to achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island, followed by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the American carrier fleet. Before the battle began, however, American intelligence intercepted his plan, allowing [[Chester Nimitz|Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508131513/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/midway/midway.htm \"Battle of Midway, June 4-7, 1942\"] history.navy.mil</ref>  The battle began on 4 June 1942. By the time it was over, the Japanese had lost four carriers, as opposed to one American carrier lost. The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for the remaining duration of the war.\n\n===Island hopping===\nFollowing the resounding victory at Midway, the United States began a major land offensive. The Allies came up with a strategy known as [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|Island hopping]], or the bypassing of islands that either served little or no strategic importance<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1671.html \"Pacific Theater, World War II \u2014 Island Hopping, 1942\u20131945\"], USHistory.com.</ref> or were heavily defended but could be bypassed, such as [[Rabaul#World War II|Rabaul]]. Because air power was crucial to any operation, only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by the Allies. The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would be savage, as the Americans faced a determined and battle-hardened enemy who had known little defeat on the ground.\n\n====Air strategy====\n[[File:Lockheed P-38J Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|P-38 Lightning]]\nGeneral [[George Kenney]], in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur, never had enough planes, pilots or supplies.<ref>George Kenney, ''General Kenney reports: a personal history of the Pacific War'' (Office of Air Force History \u2013 1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Kenney+intitle:Reports+inauthor:kenney&hl=en&ei=ias7TsLSDqrSiAK0-pH3Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA full text online]</ref>   (He was not allowed any authority whatsoever over the Navy's carriers.) But the Japanese were always in worse shape\u2014their equipment  deteriorated rapidly because of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance. The Japanese had excellent planes and pilots in 1942, but ground commanders dictated their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any other mission could be attempted. Theoretically, Japanese doctrine stressed the need to gain air superiority, but the infantry commanders repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions. When Arnold, echoing the official Army line, stated the Pacific was a \"defensive\" theater, Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the offensive.  \"He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way. To defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to the punch.\"<ref>Quoted in [[William M. Leary]], ''We Shall Return!: MacArthur's Commanders and the Defeat of Japan'' (2004) p. 99</ref>\n\nA key to Kenney's strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings. He said a major shortfall was \"the kids coming here from the States were green as grass. They were not getting enough gunnery, acrobatics, formation flying, or night flying.\"<ref>Kenney p 112</ref>  So he set up extensive retraining programs. The arrival of  superior fighters, especially the twin-tailed [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], gave the Americans an edge in range and performance. Occasionally a ripe target appeared, as in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] (March 1943) when bombers sank a major convoy bringing troops and supplies to New Guinea. That success was no fluke. High-flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships. Kenney solved that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped across the water and into the target.<ref>Martin W. Bowman, ''B-17 Flying Fortress Units of the Pacific War'' (2003) p. 59</ref>\n\n=====Building airfields=====\nThe goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields. AAF commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118,000 men; it operated in all theaters. Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers, blueprints, steel-mesh landing mats, prefabricated hangars, aviation fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move forward to the next challenge, while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps. Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old airfields, so new ones were built. Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield. Unlike the well-built German air fields in Europe, the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor siting, poor drainage, scant protection, and narrow, bumpy runways. Engineering was a low priority for the offense-minded Japanese, who chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination.<ref>Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, ''The Army Air Forces In World War  II: Vol 7: Services Around The World'' (1958) ch 10</ref>\n\n====Combat experience====\nAirmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was the case in Europe. Coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat fatigue (now called [[Combat stress reaction]]) would drastically reduce the efficiency of units. The men who had been at jungle airfields longest, the flight surgeons reported, were in a bad shape:\n::Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost all show chronic fatigue states. . . .They appear listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost masklike facial expression. Speech is slow, thought content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches, insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense of responsibility, and are hopeless about the future.\"<ref>Mae Mills Link and Hubert A. Coleman, ''Medical support of the Army Air Forces in World War II'' (1955) p 851</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\n====Marine Aviation and the issue of ground support====\n[[File:Vought F4U-1 Corsairs of VF-17 in flight, 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, 1943]]\nThe Marines had their own land-based aviation, built around the excellent [[Vought F4U Corsair|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair]], an unusually large fighter-bomber. By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons. Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops, but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation. The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks. Marine pilots, like all aviators, fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops. On the other hand, the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own. Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield. The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards  ahead. In 1944, after considerable internal acrimony, Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out. At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party (ALP) not only requested air support, but actually directed it in tactical detail. The Marine formula increased responsiveness, reduced \"friendly\" casualties, and (flying weather permitting) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery. For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation, provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed-wing fighters or bombers, although the Army was allowed to have \nsome unarmed transports and spotter planes.<ref>Robert Lee Sherrod, ''History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II'' (1952)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Guadalcanal Campaign}}\n{{See also|Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle}}\n[[File:GuadLandingsLunga.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines debark from [[LCPL|LCP(L)s]] onto Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942.]]\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign pitted American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) against determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines. Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone. As happened time and again in the Pacific, the Japanese logistical support system failed, as only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there. Consequently, the 30,000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment, adequate ammunition and even enough food; 10,000 were killed, 10,000 starved to death, and the remaining 10,000 were evacuated in February 1943. In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive. Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history, underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe.<ref>Charles W.

They quickly captured [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]], and prepared defenses. In the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge|Battle of Bloody Ridge]], the Americans held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging what was left of the Japanese. After more than six months of combat the island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943.\n[[File:Casta-MAP Guadalcanal-battles3.jpg|thumb|Guadalcanal showing several Naval battles.]]\n\nMeanwhile, the rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides diving the victories.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942 \u2013 February 1943'' (1949)</ref> Following the Japanese victory at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] on 8\u20139 August, Admiral Fletcher withdrew his ships from around Guadalcanal. A second Japanese naval force sailed south and engaged the American fleet in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24\u201325 August, ending in a draw but forced the Japanese naval force to retreat. On 11\u201312 October 1942,  to disrupt Japanese attempts to reinforce and resupply their troops on Guadalcanal (nicknamed the \"Tokyo Express\"), a small US naval force attacked this supply lines at the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and succeeded. In support of the Japanese ground offensive in October, Japanese naval forces engaged and hoped to decisively defeat any US naval forces in the area of operation at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 25\u201327 October 1942, however the Japanese failed to decisively defeat US Navy. From 12\u201315 November 1942, the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] took place: Learning that the Japanese were trying to reinforce their troops for an attack on Henderson field, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship to prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal, the U.S. succeeded thus turning back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal. A small US naval force attempted to surprise and destroy the Japanese Navy were attempting to deliver supplies to their forces on Guadalcanal at [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] however it wasn't successful. The final naval battle took place between 29\u201330 January 1943, known as the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], US naval forces attempted to stop the Japanese Navy evacuating its ground forces from Guadalcanal, however the Japanese successfully forced the US Navy to withdraw, protecting the Japanese evacuation.<ref>Richard Overy, ''War in the Pacific'' (2010)</ref>\n\n====Tarawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Tarawa}}\n\nGuadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would fight to the bitter end. After brutal fighting in which few prisoners were taken on either side, the United States and the Allies pressed on the offensive. The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943, by the Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the Japanese lines of defense either sank, were disabled or took on too much water to be of use. The Americans were eventually able to land a limited number of tanks and drive inland. After days of fighting they took control of Tarawa on 23 November. Of the original 2,600 Japanese soldiers on the island, only 17 were still alive.\n\n====Operations in Central Pacific====\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|215px|Admiral [[William F. Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Allies started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Moving closer to Japan, the U.S. Navy decisively won the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and landing forces captured the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]] in summer 1944. The goal was building airbases within range of the new B-29 bomber aimed at Japan's industrial cities.\n\n====Liberation of the Philippines====\n{{Main|Battle of Leyte Gulf|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in  23\u201326 October 1944, was a decisive American victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in arguably the [[largest naval battle in history]]. Although the Japanese came surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans, at the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost. The battle was a complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte, which the U.S. Army had just invaded. The army forces were highly vulnerable to naval attack, and the Japanese goal was to inflict massive destruction. Two American fleets were involved, the Seventh and Third, but they were independent and did not communicate well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two American fleets and almost reached the beaches. However the Japanese communication system was even worse, and the Japanese army and navy did not cooperate, and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Battle for Leyte Gulf'' (1947)</ref>\n\nGeneral MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944. The grueling re-capture of the Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], and [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindanao]].\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[M4 Sherman|M4 Sherman tank]] equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker on Iwo Jima, March 1945.]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}\nThe Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it wanted bases for fighter escorts; it was actually used as an emergency landing base for B-29s. The Japanese knew they could not win, but they devised a strategy to maximize American casualties. Learning from the [[Battle of Saipan]] they prepared many fortified positions on the island, including [[Bunker|pillboxes]] and tunnels. The Marines attack began on 19 February 1945. Initially the Japanese put up no resistance, letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from [[Mount Suribachi]] and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded. Over the next 36 days, the Japanese were pressed into an ever-shrinking pocket, but they chose to fight on to the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 defenders alive. The Marines suffered as well, suffering 25,000 casualties. The battle became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate hand-to-hand combat.<ref>Joseph H. Alexander, ''Closing In: Marines in the Seizure of Iwo Jima'' (1994), short Marine Corps history [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Iwo/index.html online edition]</ref>\n\n====Okinawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\n[[Okinawa]] became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the Second World War. The island was to become a staging area for the eventual [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] since it was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the [[Mainland Japan|Japanese mainland]]. Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots caused the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 soldiers and 150,000 civilians. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Army and the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Strategic Bombing of Japan====\n[[File:39th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|B-29 Superfortress dropping 500 pound high-explosive bombs over Japan, 1945.]]\n{{main|Air raids on Japan}}\nThe flammability of Japan's large cities, and the concentration of munitions production there, made strategic bombing the favorite strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward. The first efforts were made from bases in China, where massive efforts to establish B-29 bases there and supply them over the Hump (the Himalayas) failed in 1944; the Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases. [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]], captured by the U.S. in June 1944, gave secure bases for the very-long-range B-29. The [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] boasted four 2,200 horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons of bombs 33,000 feet (high above Japanese flak or fighters), and make 3,500 mile round trips. However, the systematic raids that began in June 1944, were unsatisfactory, because the AAF had learned too much in Europe; it overemphasized self-defense. Arnold, in personal charge of the campaign (bypassing the theater commanders) brought in a new leader, brilliant, indefatigable, hard-charging General [[Curtis LeMay]]. In early 1945, LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics: remove the machine guns and gunners, fly in low at night. (Much fuel was used to get to 30,000 feet; it could now be replaced with more bombs.) The Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems were so ineffective that they could not hit the bombers. Fires raged through the cities, and millions of civilians fled to the mountains.<ref>John Olsen, ''A History of Air Warfare'' (2009) p 74</ref>\n\nTokyo was hit repeatedly, and during [[Operation Meetinghouse|the first massive fire raid of March 9\u201310, 1945]] suffered a conflagration of about 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) in area, that killed at least 83,000. On 5 June, 51,000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were burned out by 473 B-29s; the Japanese were learning to fight back, as 11 B-29s went down and 176 were damaged.<ref>Donald L. Miller, ''D-days in the Pacific'' (2005) p. 2222</ref> Osaka, where one-sixth of the Empire's munitions were made, was hit by 1,733 tons of incendiaries dropped by 247 B-29s.

Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks, workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories, and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.\n\nThe Japanese army, which was not based in the cities, was largely undamaged by the raids. The Army was short of food and gasoline, but, as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved, it was capable of ferocious resistance. The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace, the Kamikaze.\n\n====Kamikaze====\nIn late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective new tactic, the [[Kamikaze]] suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at American ships. The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the end of the war. Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because they could navigate; they were not Kamikazes, and they returned to base for another mission. The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had minimal training; however most were well educated and intensely committed to the Emperor.<ref>Syohgo Hattori, \"Kamikaze: Japan's Glorious Failure.\" ''Air Power History'' 1996 43(1): 14\u201327. {{ISSN|1044-016X}}</ref><ref>Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima, ''The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II'' (1994)</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|A \"Judy\" in a suicide dive against {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}.

Rielly, ''Kamikazes, Corsairs, and Picket Ships: Okinawa, 1945'' (2010)</ref> Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa in April 1945:\n:\"Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination. These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude, dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage. They tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, and came in at any altitude or on the water.\"<ref>quoted in Norman Friedman, ''U.S. naval weapons: every gun, missile, mine, and torpedo used by the U.S. Navy from 1883 to the present day'' (1982) p 93</ref>\n\nThe Americans decided the best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them out on the ground, or else in the air long before they approached the fleet. The Navy called for more fighters, and more warning, which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships, more radar picket ships (which themselves became prime targets), and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies. Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945, because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands. The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes, and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip, the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further. Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target, the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing. Japan's industry was manufacturing 1,500 new planes a month in 1945. However, the quality of construction was very poor, and many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets.\n\nExpecting increased resistance, including far more Kamikaze attacks once the main islands of Japan were invaded, the U.S. high command rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war, hoping it would make a costly invasion unnecessary.<ref>John Ray Skates, ''The invasion of Japan: alternative to the bomb'' (2000) p. 241</ref>\n\n====U.S. submarines in the Pacific====\n{{main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese Patrol Boat No.39 sinking after being torpedoed on 23 April 1943.jpg|thumb|A Japanese escort vessel sinking after being torpedoed by the {{USS|Seawolf|SS-197|6}}, 23 April 1943.]]\n\nU.S. submarines participated in the majority of naval battles in the Pacific theater, but the submarines were most decisive in their blockade of Japan, for which Japan was dependent on its sea transport to provide resources for its war effort.\n\nOn the afternoon of 7 December 1941, six hours after the Japanese attack, U.S. naval commanders in the Pacific were ordered by the U.S. Navy Chief of Staff to \"execute unrestricted air and submarine warfare against Japan\".<ref>Spector (1984), pp.478\u2013479; Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.106; Holwitt, Joel I.

This included reconnaissance U.S. submarines landed and supplied guerillas in Japanese occupied territory and carrying in commandos for missions such as the [[Makin Island raid]], they also rescued crews of aircraft which had been forced down over the ocean.\n\nAs a result of several key improvements in strategy and tactics, from 1943, Allied submarines waged a more effective campaign against Japanese merchant shipping and the IJN, in effect strangling the Japanese Empire of resources. By the end of the war in August 1945, U.S. Navy submarines sank around 1300 Japanese merchant ships, as well as roughly 200 warships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/submarines.htm|title=World War 2 Submarines|publisher=}}</ref> Only 42 U.S. submarines were sunk in the Pacific,<ref name=pigboats>Roscoe, Theodore.

A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate. As Japan was able to withstand the devastating incendiary raids and the naval blockade despite hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, President Harry Truman gave the order to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|drop the only two available atomic bombs]], hoping that such sheer force of destruction on a city would break Japanese resolve and end the war. The first bomb was dropped on an industrial city, [[Hiroshima]], on 6 August 1945, killing appropriately 70,000 people. A second bomb was dropped on another industrial city, [[Nagasaki]], on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender, killing approximately 35,000 people. Fearing additional atomic attacks, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945.\n\n[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] which occurred on 15 August 1945 marked the end of the United States' war with the Empire of Japan. Since Japan was the last remaining Axis Power, V-J Day also marked the end of World War II.\n\n==Minor American front==\n{{Main|China Burma India Theater}}\n\nThe United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India theater, such as the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) but nicknamed \"[[Merrill's Marauders]]\" after its commander; [[Frank Merrill]], it  was a United States Army [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] unit organized as light infantry assault units. In slightly more than five months of combat in 1944, the Marauders advanced 750 miles through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements, mostly behind enemy lines, with or in support of British Empire and Chinese forces in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] and suffered many casualties. On 10 August 1944 the Marauders were consolidated into the 475th Infantry. The U.S. also had an adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Joseph Stillwell]]. Units of the [[Tenth Air Force]], [[Fourteenth Air Force]], and [[Twentieth Air Force]] of the USAAF also served in the theatre, including the previously mentioned \"Flying Tigers\".\n\n==Attacks on U.S. soil==\n{{main|American Theater (World War II)}}\nAlthough the [[Axis powers]] never launched a full-scale [[invasion of the United States]], there were attacks and acts of sabotage on U.S. soil.\n* January\u2013August 1942 \u2013 [[Second Happy Time]], German U-Boats engaged American ships off the U.S. East Coast.\n* February 23, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Ellwood]], a Japanese submarine attack on California.\n* March 4, 1942 \u2013 [[Operation K]], a Japanese reconnaissance over Pearl Harbor following the attack on December 7, 1941. \n* June 3, 1942 \u2013 August 15, 1943 \u2013 [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], the battle for the then incorporated territory of Alaska.\n* June 21\u201322, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Fort Stevens]], the second attack on a U.S. military base in the continental U.S. in World War II.\n* September 9, 1942, and September 29, 1942 \u2013 [[Lookout Air Raids]], the only attack by enemy aircraft on the U.S. mainland and the second enemy aircraft attack on the U.S. continent in World War II.\n* November 1944\u2013April 1945 \u2013 [[Fu-Go balloon bomb]]s, over 9,300 of them were launched by Japan across the Pacific Ocean towards the U.S. mainland to start forest fires.
