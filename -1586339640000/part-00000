It is a [[problem play]] about the moral dilemmas created by limited medical resources, and the conflicts between the demands of private medicine as a business and a vocation.\n\n==Characters==\nRoles and original cast:\n\n*Mr. Danby \u2013 [[Lewis Casson]]\n*Sir Patrick Cullen \u2013 William Farren, Junr.\n*Louis Dubedat \u2013 [[Harley Granville-Barker]]\n*Emmy \u2013 [[Claire Greet]]\n*Dr. Blenkinsop \u2013 Edmund Gurney\n*Minnie Tinwell \u2013 Mary Hamilton\n*Cutler Walpole \u2013 James Hearn\n*Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonington \u2013 [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]]\n*The Newspaper Man \u2013 Trevor Lowe\n*A Waiter \u2013 [[Percy Marmont]]\n*Jennifer Dubedat \u2013 [[Lillah McCarthy]]\n*Redpenny \u2013 [[Norman Page]]\n*Leo Schutzmacher \u2013 Michael Sherbrooke\n*Sir Colenso Ridgeon \u2013 [[Ben Webster (actor)|Ben Webster]]\n\nTHE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA\nROYAL COURT THEATRE PROGRAMME  \n\"Commencing Monday December 31st, 1906 for Six Weeks Only\"\nThe Newspaper Man is played by Mr Jules Shaw, according to this programme.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Jo Mielziner Doctor's Dilemma.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Photograph of scene designed by [[Jo Mielziner]] for George Bernard Shaw's ''Doctor's Dilemma'', 1927]]\nThe eponymous dilemma of the play is that of the newly honoured doctor Sir Colenso Ridgeon, who has developed a revolutionary new cure for tuberculosis. However, his private medical practice, with limited staff and resources, can only treat ten patients at a time. From a group of fifty patients he has selected ten he believes he can cure and who, he believes, are most worthy of being saved. However, when he is approached by a young woman, Jennifer Dubedat, with a deadly ill husband, Louis Dubedat, he admits he can, at a stretch, save one more patient, but that the individual in question must be shown to be most worthy of being saved. However, the situation is complicated when an old friend and colleague reveals, he too, needs treatment. Sir Colenso must choose which patient he will save: a kindly, altruistic poor medical colleague, or an extremely gifted but also very unpleasant, womaniser, bigamist and amoral young artist. Sir Colenso falls instantly in love with the young and vivacious Mrs Dubedat and this makes it even harder for the doctor to separate his motives for the decision of who shall live.\n\n==Preface==\nThe preface to the play \u2013\u00a0typically, as long as the drama itself \u2013 is an extensive tirade against the professions, and in particular the medical profession.  As a founding member of the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] movement in 1884, Shaw \u2013 a school drop-out who had used the British Library to achieve a massive self-education programme in his 20s and was active in local politics in the deprived London area of St Pancras \u2013 was a passionate critic of the huge disparities between the wealthy and the poor, and his unique combination of prodigious intellect and panoramic knowledge meant that he was seldom intimidated in his mission for fairness and truth.  At the time of this play he was a highly successful dramatist, with works such as ''[[Man and Superman]]'' and ''[[Major Barbara]]'' enjoying international acclaim. ''The Doctor's Dilemma'' would come to be seen as the greatest satire on the medical profession since [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s ''[[Malade Imaginaire]]''<ref>Iain McClure, British Medical Journal, 4 August 2007, \"The Doctor's Dilemma\".</ref>.\n\nShaw credits [[Almroth Wright]] as the source of his information on medical science: \"It will be evident to all experts that my play could not have been written but for the work done by Sir Alm[r]oth Wright on the theory and practice of securing immunization from bacterial diseases by the inoculation of vaccines made of their own bacteria.\"<ref>Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, ''Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw'', A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.41.</ref>  This remark is characteristically ironical.  Wright was knighted shortly before this play was written, and Shaw was suspicious of Wright's high reputation (the latter was also known by the nickname Sir Almost Right). The two men met in 1905, and engaged in a long series of robust discussions, involving at one point a challenge from the medical audience that they had \"too many patients on our hands already\". Shaw's response was to ask what would be done if there was more demand from patients than could be satisfied, and Wright answered: \"We should have to consider which life was worth saving.\" This became the \"dilemma\" of the play<ref>Michael Holroyd, ''The Guardian'' 13 July 2012, \"Bernard Shaw and his lethally absurd doctor's dilemma\".</ref>.\n\nThe preface mentions that there is another dilemma: poor doctors are easily tempted to perform costly but useless (and in the best case harmless) operations or treatments on their patients for personal gain. \"Could I not make a better use of a pocketful of guineas than this man is making of his leg?\" This was reportedly inspired by the behaviour of a prominent Ear Nose and Throat specialist in London who had developed a simple and almost harmless operation to remove the [[uvula]], which did no benefit to his patients but made the surgeon a great deal of money.\n\n==Significance==\nThe play also mentions (then) new developments in the [[germ theory of disease]], namely [[opsonin]]s, and included [[socialist]] and anti-[[vivisection]]ist viewpoints. \n\nThe theme of the play remains current: in any time, there will be treatments that are so scarce or costly that some people can have them while others cannot. Who is to decide, and on which grounds is the decision to be taken?\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that an unexpected side-effect of the play's success was to greatly increase the popularity of the first name \"[[Jennifer (given name)|Jennifer]]\" (the name of the main female protagonist) in the English-speaking world.  However, UK government statistics (covering England and Wales) only show the name 'Jennifer' first entering the top 100 most commonly used names for baby girls in 1934\u2014a full 28 years after the play was first staged.  Similarly, the name didn't enter the top ''1,000'' names for newborn US girls until 1938.\n\n==Production information==\n''The Doctor's Dilemma'' was first produced on 20 November 1906 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=2227 Irish Playography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502064748/http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_ID=2227 |date=2007-05-02 }}</ref>\n\nActress [[Katharine Cornell]] produced the play in 1941, starring herself and [[Raymond Massey]].<ref>Tad Mosel, \"Leading Lady:  The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell,\" Little, Brown & Co., Boston (1978)</ref>\n\nA [[The Doctor's Dilemma (film)|film adaptation]] of the play, with the same title, was made in 1958, directed by [[Anthony Asquith]], starring [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Dirk Bogarde]].<ref>[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Doctors-Dilemma/listType/alpha ''The Doctors's Dilemma'' - 1958 film] - at ''Britmovie.co.uk''</ref>\n\nThe play\u2019s most recent high-profile revival was on the Lyttelton stage at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-doctors-dilemma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103232330/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-doctors-dilemma |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}</ref> The production was directed by Nadia Fall, with [[Aden Gillett]] playing the eponymous doctor, [[Genevieve O'Reilly]] as Jennifer Dubedat, and [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] as Louis Dubedat.

They lived in Brindavan, rearing animals and eking their livelihood by selling dairy products. Since Lord Sri Krishna spent his childhood among the Gollas, it is said that the [[Yadava]] clan of Sri Krishna is of the same community. It is also stated that they lived in Repalle village at the beginning of [[Kali Yuga|Kali Yug]]. During the reign of Rajaraja Narendra, it was said that they immigrated to southern regions from Repalle. It is because of the above inferences, the Gollas consider themselves to belong to the Yadava clan or Golla kings. The very term Golla kings asserts their kinship with [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]], besides asserting them to be of a higher stratum of the society.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya.

So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

Kumara Kampana was tasked with protecting the temple Endowments and recruiting many leaders to take on the responsibilities of Pandya Nadu.\n\nHis wife [[Gangadevi]], who was present during the invasion of Madurai, records the siege and conquest of Madurai in her Sanskrit treatise [[Madura Vijayam|Madhura Vijayam]].<ref name=\"Jackson2005\">{{cite book|author=William Joseph Jackson|title=Vijayanagara Voices: Exploring South Indian History and Hindu Literature|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3950-3|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=PxvDNBc4qwUC&pg=PA61 61]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/lA100/lA100pd1.jsp?bookid=224&pno=392 |title = Tvu}}</ref>\n\n==Sri Krishnadevaraya's Clan==\n\n[[File:vijayanagara.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sri Krishnadevaraya]]\n\n* The Below informations are Published by [[Archeological Survey of India]] in the book \"Annual Report of the Mysore Archeological Department\".\n\n===Nanjagud Taluk Inscription Translation===\nBe it well.

Victory to the Adorable (Padmanabha) who resembles the sky free\nfrom clouds.While the illustrious Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja seated on the stable throne, \u2018the prosperous king of kings, lord of kings, champion over those who wear moustaches in the great earth, kathdri-sahwa (dagger and kite), ruler over the southern sea,\nNarasimha-mahadhiraja\u2019s son ; a sun to the firmament that is the [[Yadava]] race of\nwhich he is a lineal descendant ; crest-jewel to righteousness, (delighter) of all the\nassemblage of bards, brother to the wives of others, support for purity, heroism and prowess; possessed of lotus-like feet on which bow the jewelled crowns of all the kings, kathari-trinitra (a Siva in the use of dagger) : was ruling the earth :\u2014 Under the orders of vira Krishnaraya, while he was pleased to go on a victorious\nexpedition to the south : \u2014the illustrious mahapradhana (chief minister) Saluva\nTimmarasa of Yajus-sakha, Khandava-gotra, and Apastambha-sutra made a gift to the best of the gods, Kirtinarayanadevaru of [[Talakadu|Talakad]] which is Rajarajapura, south Benares and Gajaranya-kshetra, of the village Kavahalli in Thayuru-sthala, with the right to enjoy the eight rights and powers in the village including all the rice-fields, dry lands, gardens, vegetable gardens (tudike), money income, treasure, deposits underground, water springs, rocks, imperishables, future accruals, existing rights and possibilities. The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

The track on the CD begins at the inside and spirals outward so a disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.\n\n[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (\u2300) and wavelength (\u03bb). -->]]\nThe program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is {{no wrap|86.05 cm<sup>2</sup> / 1.6 \u00b5m {{=}}}} {{no wrap|5.38 km.}} With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Compact disc bird scarers.JPG|thumb|Old CDs hanging from a tree to scare birds from the crops.]]\nAfter the fall in popularity of CDs, old discs or failed CD-R have been repurposed, since the reflections of the sun on a moving plate may [[bird scarer|scare birds]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n}}\n\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

The track on the CD begins at the inside and spirals outward so a disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.\n\n[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (\u2300) and wavelength (\u03bb). -->]]\nThe program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is {{no wrap|86.05 cm<sup>2</sup> / 1.6 \u00b5m {{=}}}} {{no wrap|5.38 km.}} With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n}}\n\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

[[Ful medames]] (dish of cooked fava beans), one of Egypt's several national dishes, is typical. It is seasoned with salt and cumin, garnished with vegetable oil and optionally with [[tahini]], chopped parsley, chopped tomato, garlic, onion, lemon juice, chili pepper and often served topped with a boiled egg. It is scooped up and eaten with the staple whole wheat pita bread called ''Eish Masri'' or ''Eish Baladi'' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: {{lang|arz|\u0639\u064a\u0634}} {{IPA-arz|\u0295e\u02d0\u0283|}}; [[Modern Standard Arabic]]: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfay\u0161}}'') and usually accompanied by ''ta\u02bfamiya'' ({{lang-arz|\u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629}}) which is the local variant of [[falafel]] made with fava beans, fresh cut homemade [[French fries]] and various fresh or pickled vegetables (called [[torshi]]). Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as ''koko''. For the south western [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] people (Il\u00e9 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1) one of the most common breakfasts is ''[[\u00d2g\u00ec]]''\u2014 a porridge made from corn, usually served with [[evaporated milk]]. \u00d2g\u00ec is eaten with ''[[Acaraj\u00e9]]'' (akara) or ''[[Moin Moin|Moi moi]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/food/fo-44786_1_nigerian-bean-cakes|title=Nigerian Bean Cakes Make a Hearty Breakfast|last=Dosti|first=Rose|date=25 February 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> Both are made from ground bean paste; akara is fried in oil, and moi moi is wrapped in leaves or foil and then steamed. \u00d2g\u00ec can also be steamed in leaves to harden it and eaten with akara or moi moi for breakfast.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

[[Indiana University Press]]. p. 331.</ref> Breakfast also often consists of open sandwiches. The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese.

Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy). Fried eggs with [[pastirma]] is also a common breakfast food in Egypt.\n\n=== Malawi ===\nFor breakfast, some children in Malawi eat porridge, [[cornbread]], savory [[fritter]]s, boiled starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, or [[pumpkin]], and drink [[Sweet tea|sweet black tea]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html|title=What Kids Around the World Eat for Breakfast|last=Whitaker|first=Hannah|date=2014-10-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Morocco===\n[[File:Rghaif (detalle).jpg|thumb|right|[[Msemen]], a common breakfast in [[Moroccan cuisine]]]]\nFor breakfast, many Moroccans eat bread, harsha (semolina griddle cakes), or [[msemen]] (oiled pancakes) with olive oil, tea, and different kinds of Moroccan crepes.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine \u2013 Cooking Classes in Morocco &#124; Fes Cooking and Cultural Tours|author=Special Events|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Fescooking.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[Nigeria]] has over 250 different ethnic groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov}}</ref> with a corresponding variety of cuisines.

Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as ''koko''.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. ''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast. Thus there is no single standard Indian breakfast, with items changing with regions. However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into two types: North Indian and South Indian.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

Frequently breakfast can be as simple as butter and jam on bread with tea. Iranians prefer to drink their hot black tea with sugar. Traditional cooked dishes for breakfast include [[haleem]] (wheat and chicken/lamb/turkey porridge eaten with cinnamon) or [[Khash (dish)|kale pache]] (sheep's feet, stomach, and other offal), adasi (green lentil soup), fried/boiled/soft-boiled eggs, ''omlet'' (eggs cooked in tomato sauce).\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Israeli breakfast}}\n[[File:The 7 Breakfasts - Espresso Bar.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Israeli breakfast]]]]\nThe Israeli breakfast is a mix of culinary influences from eastern Europe, [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Yishuv]] culture, [[Maghreb cuisine|North African cuisine]], and [[Levantine cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonvoyageurs.com/2016/05/15/israeli-breakfast/|title=The Israeli breakfast \u2013 Best in the world!|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lynn|date=15 May 2016|website=BonVoyageurs|publisher=|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref> It usually consists of a range of cheeses along with sliced vegetables, scrambled eggs (or another kind of fried egg)<ref name=\"Dubois\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GDy_1w83KEUC&pg=PA122&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22#v=onepage&q=%22Israeli%20breakfast%22&f=false|title=Cultures of the World: Israel|last=Dubois|first=Jill|last2=Rosh|first2=Mair|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2004|isbn=9780761416692|location=[[Singapore]]|page=122|jfm=}}</ref><ref name=\"Marks\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT563&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|last=Marks|first=Gil|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2010|isbn=9780544186316|location=[[Boston]]|jfm=|authorlink=Gil Marks}}</ref> and bread, served with spreads like butter, jam, or honey.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

His books were published in 27 languages and sold more than 60 million copies worldwide.  Each new book he wrote after he became an established writer sold more than one million copies.<ref name = \"outsider\"/>\n\nWest's works were often focused on international politics and the role of the Roman Catholic Church in international affairs. One of his best known works, ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' (1963), described the election and career of a Slav as Pope, 15 years before the historic election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. The sequel, ''The Clowns of God'', described a successor Pope who resigned the papacy to live in seclusion, 32 years before the abdication of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2013.\n\n==Early Life==\nWest was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], the son of a commercial salesman. Due to the large size of his family, he was sent to live with his grandparents. He attended the [[Christian Brothers College, St Kilda]] where he was was awarded the prize of Dux by Archbishop Mannix  in 1929.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, he entered the Christian Brothers seminary at St Patricks in Strathfield, Sydneym \"as a kind of refuge\" from a difficult childhood.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/12/books/morris-west-popular-novelist-focusing-on-faith-dies-at-83.html Honan, William H., \"Morris West, Popular Novelist Focusing on Faith, Dies at 83\", ''New York Times'', 12 October 1999]</ref> \n\nIn 1934 he began teaching at St Thomas's Primary School, Lewisham, living in that community until 1936. He taught at schools in Tasmania and New South Wales in between 1937 and 1939, while also studying at the University of Tasmania. \n\nHe left the Christian Brothers Order in 1940, unable to follow a celibate lifestyle.

Of the 18 novels he was to write post-1957, 15 are on this subject This discovery was particularly felicitous for West because, it suited his talents admirably. An interesting comparison may be made with [[David Williamson]], another writer from whom profound thinking and significant insights are not to be expected. What they have in common is a keen eye for the real world around them. By fleshing out the partially familiar, they make perceptive sense of it, demonstrating in the process that the general uneasiness and suspicion ordinary people feel about many aspects of contemporary life are well-founded.

It has a foreword by [[Thomas Keneally]], an editor's note by his publisher Angelo Loukakis and an epilogue co-written by his assistant Beryl Barraclough and his widow Joy West.\n\n==Personal life==\nMorris West was born on 26 April 1916, in St Kilda.  He and his first wife, Elizabeth Harvey, had two children: Elizabeth, who became a nun, and Julian, who was a wine-maker before his death in 2005. Julian and his wife Helen Grimaux, had a daughter named Juliana Harriett West.\n\nWest and Elizabeth Harvey divorced, and West then married Joyce \"Joy\" Lawford. Since his first wife, Elizabeth, was still alive when he married Joy, he struggled for a church annulment of his first marriage. He was out of communion with the Roman Catholic Church for many years because of this marital situation, and he had significant issues with the church's teachings. However, he never considered himself as anything other than a committed Catholic. Joy West said that he was a believer who attended Mass every Sunday.<ref name = \"last writes\"/>\n\nWest and Joy had four children together.  One son, C. Chris O'Hanlon, born in 1954, changed his name at the age of 26 as a gesture of independence.

His books were published in 27 languages and sold more than 60 million copies worldwide.  Each new book he wrote after he became an established writer sold more than one million copies.<ref name = \"outsider\"/>\n\nWest's works were often focused on international politics and the role of the Roman Catholic Church in international affairs. One of his best known works, ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' (1963), described the election and career of a Slav as Pope, 15 years before the historic election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. The sequel, ''The Clowns of God'', described a successor Pope who resigned the papacy to live in seclusion, 32 years before the abdication of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2013.\n\n==Early Life==\nWest was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], the son of a commercial salesman.

An interesting comparison may be made with [[David Williamson]], another writer from whom profound thinking and significant insights are not to be expected. What they have in common is a keen eye for the real world around them. By fleshing out the partially familiar, they make perceptive sense of it, demonstrating in the process that the general uneasiness and suspicion ordinary people feel about many aspects of contemporary life are well-founded.

Julian and his wife Helen Grimaux, had a daughter named Juliana Harriett West.\n\nWest and Elizabeth Harvey divorced, and West then married Joyce \"Joy\" Lawford. Since his first wife, Elizabeth, was still alive when he married Joy, he struggled for a church annulment of his first marriage.

However, he never considered himself as anything other than a committed Catholic.
