Following the dissolution of [[NATO]], the United States [[Greenlandic independence|recognizes Greenland's independence]] from [[Denmark]], in exchange for using the newly-independent Kalaallit Nunaat fleet of [[icebreaker]]s to move the ghost fleet through the [[Northwest Passage]]. An eccentric [[Silicon Valley]] billionaire, using his personal wealth and resources, seizes control of the [[Chinese large modular space station|Chinese space station]] and neutralizes China's anti-satellite systems. Simultaneously, another Silicon Valley magnate wages his own separate campaign against China by using his connections to get into contact with the hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The group manages to launch their own cyberattack, which cripples the Directorate's cyberwarfare capabilities indefinitely. The United States' military is ultimately able to liberate Hawaii, aided by the Ghost Fleet, the [[United States Special Operations Command]] and aircraft reactivated from the [[United States Air Force]] [[Aircraft boneyard|boneyard]].

It is implied in the text that she was previously the victim of systematic sexual and physical abuse at the hands of her father and was recovering with the help of her fianc\u00e9. He is subsequently killed during the invasion when his F-35 is compromised due to the malware in the Chinese-made microchips. Now psychologically changed, she begins a systematic campaign of killing Chinese soldiers who are occupying Honolulu. Earning her the moniker, the \"Black Widow.\" Her killings come to the attention of both General Yu Xilai, the Chinese commander of the occupation and his subordinate, Russian Colonel Vladimir Markov. Her actions culminate in Shin and Markov establishing a grudging respect for one another and she feigns capture in order to get close to Yu, whom she violently strangles to death at his headquarters with Markov's silent consent; just as the U.S. counterattack begins.\n\n==Characters in ''Ghost Fleet''==\n* [[Commander (United States)#Naval|Commander]] Jamie Simmons.

It is the successor of the [[Berlin Observatory]] founded in 1700 and of the [[Astrophysical Institute Potsdam#Foundation of the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam .28AOP.29|Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam]] (AOP) founded in 1874. The latter was the world's first observatory to emphasize explicitly the research area of [[astrophysics]].  The AIP was founded in 1992, in a re-structuring following the [[German reunification]].\n\nThe AIP is privately funded and member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]]. It is located in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]] in the state of [[Brandenburg]], just west of [[Berlin]], though the [[Einstein Tower]] solar observatory and the great [[Refracting telescope|refractor telescope]]<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\">[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/Telegrafenberg_Observatory.Grosser_Refraktor.html Great Refractor telescope] at Telegrafenberg</ref> on [[Telegrafenberg]] in [[Potsdam]] belong to the AIP.\n\nThe key topics of the AIP are cosmic [[magnetic field]]s ([[magnetohydrodynamics]]) on various scales and [[extragalactic astrophysics]].  Astronomical and astrophysical fields studied at the AIP range from [[Solar physics|solar]] and [[stellar physics]] to [[Stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]] to [[cosmology]].\n\nThe institute also develops research technology in the fields of [[spectroscopy]] and [[robotic telescope]]s.  It is a partner of the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] in Arizona, has erected robotic telescopes in [[Tenerife]] and the Antarctic, develops astronomical instrumentation for large telescopes such as the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] of the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]].  Furthermore, work on several [[e-Science]] projects<ref name=\"E-SCIENCE\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aip.de/groups/escience/ |title=e-Science at the AIP |access-date=2009-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181455/http://www.aip.de/groups/escience/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are carried out at the AIP.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe history of astronomy in [[Potsdam]] really began in Berlin in 1700. Initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried W. Leibniz]], on July 11, 1700 the \"Brandenburgische Societ\u00e4t\" (later called the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]) was founded by the elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich III]] in Berlin. Two months earlier the national calendar monopoly provided the funding for an observatory. By May 18 the first director, [[Gottfried Kirch]], had been appointed. This happened in a hurry, because the profits from the national basic calendar, calculated and sold by the observatory, should have been the financial source for the academy. This kind of financing existed until the beginning of the 19th century, but the basic calendar was calculated until very recently (it stopped after the ''[[Die Wende|Wende]]'' in 1991).\n\n[[Image:Sternwarte Berlin Schinkel.jpg|thumb|200px|Alte ''New [[Berliner Sternwarte]]'' at Linden Street]]\n\nIn 1711 the first observatory was built in Dorotheen Street in Berlin and in 1835 a new observatory building, which was designed by the famous architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], was completed in Linden Street (near Hallesches Tor). [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was then promoting astronomy by his famous \"Kosmos\" lectures in 1827\u201328. He played an important role in providing the funds for both observatory and instruments.\n\nThe [[Berlin Observatory]] became known worldwide when [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] discovered the planet [[Neptune]] in 1846. The discoveries of the [[Anode ray|canal rays]] by [[Eugen Goldstein]] in 1886 in the physical laboratory of the observatory and of the variation in the altitude of the Earth's pole by [[Karl Friedrich K\u00fcstner]] in 1888 were likewise important.\n\nThe last two scientific events took place when [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]] was director of the observatory, which was meanwhile attached to the University of Berlin. He prepared the basis for the astronomical observatories in Potsdam: in 1874 the foundation of the AOP on the Telegrafenberg and in 1913 the removal of the Berlin Observatory to Babelsberg.\n\n=== Foundation of the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam (AOP) ===\n[[Image:AOP-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ''Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam'' isn't used as observatory any more. Nowadays it hosts the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] as part of the [[Albert Einstein Science Park]]]]\n[[Image:L-Observatorium.png|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of the ''Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam'']]\n[[Image:Great Refractor Potsdam.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The \"Gro\u00dfe Refraktor\" of 1899, a double telescope with a 80cm (31.5\") and 50 cm (19.5\") lenses]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] was developed by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]]. It enabled the acquisition of information on the physical parameters and chemical abundances of stars, by the spectral analysis of their light. Foerster recognized these possibilities and initiated the building of a solar observatory in 1871 as a memorial to the crown prince, in which he emphasized the importance and profit of solar research. This idea was soon extended to the whole of astrophysics.\n\nThe site of the observatory was chosen on a hill south of [[Potsdam]], the Telegrafenberg, on which had been, from 1832 to 1848, a relay station of the military telegraph from Berlin to Koblenz. On 1 July 1874 the AOP was founded. Even before the construction of the observatory had started in the autumn of 1876, solar observations were being made from the tower of the former military orphanage in Linden Street in Potsdam by [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer]]. The construction work started in 1876; the main observatory building and its equipment were finished in the autumn of 1879.\n\nThe AOP was managed by a board of directors comprising [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Arthur Auwers]]. In 1882 [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Carl Hermann Vogel]] was appointed as sole director of the observatory. The main focus of his work was now on stellar astrophysics. He was the first successfully to determine radial velocities of stars photographically and as a result he discovered the [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]].\n\nIn 1899 one of the biggest [[Refracting telescope|refractor]] in the world, [[Great Refractor]] of Potsdam,<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\" /> with lenses of 80 and 50&nbsp;cm, was manufactured by the firms of [[Carl August von Steinheil|Steinheil]] and [[Johann Georg Repsold|Repsold]], and mounted in a 24&nbsp;m dome. It was inaugurated in a great celebration by the German emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. Although it did not realize all the hopes astronomers had for it, nevertheless two important discoveries should be mentioned: the [[Interstellar medium#The history of knowledge of interstellar space|interstellar calcium lines]] in the spectrum of the spectroscopic binary [[Delta Orionis]] by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904<ref>{{cite journal | title=Investigations on the spectrum and orbit of delta Orionis | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1904ApJ....19..268H | last1=Hartmann | first1=J. | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=19 | pages=268\u2013286 | year=1904 | bibcode=1904ApJ....19..268H | doi=10.1086/141112 }}</ref> and the presence of stellar calcium emission lines \u2014 a hint of stellar surface activity \u2014 by [[Gustav Eberhard]] and [[Hans Ludendorff]] about 1900.\n{{further|Potsdam Great Refractor}}\n\nTen years later one of the most famous astrophysicists of this century, [[Karl Schwarzschild]], became director of the observatory. In only a few years of work (by 1916 he had died from a chronic illness) he had made fundamental contributions in astrophysics and to [[General relativity|General Relativity Theory]]. Only a few weeks after the theory's publication by Einstein, Schwarzschild found the first solution of the [[Einstein field equations|Einstein equations]], which is now named after him as the \"[[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]]\" and which is of fundamental importance for the theory of black holes.\n\nThere exist further close links between the AOP and Einstein's Relativity Theory. In 1881 [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Albert A. Michelson]] first performed his [[interferometer]] experiments<ref>[http://www.aip.de/pr/Michelson.e.html The Michelson experiment in Potsdam]</ref> in the cellar of the main building of the AOP, that were to disprove the movement of the Earth through a hypothetical [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. His negative results were fundamentally reconciled only through Einstein's [[Special Relativity]] theory of 1905.\n\n[[Image:Einsteinturm 7443.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Einstein Tower]] at Telegrafenberg today. By [[Erich Mendelsohn]]]]\nTo prove the [[gravitational redshift]] of spectral lines of the Sun \u2014 an effect proposed by Einstein's theory of General Relativity \u2014 was the aim of a [[Einstein Tower|solar tower telescope]], which was built from 1921 to 1924 at the instigation of [[Erwin Finlay-Freundlich]]. Though at that time it was not yet technically possible to measure the gravitational redshift, important developments in solar and plasma physics were started here and the architect, [[Erich Mendelsohn]], created with this peculiarly expressionistic tower a unique scientific building.\n\nBesides the work of Schwarzschild, in the following decades important observational programmes such as the ''Potsdamer Photometrische Durchmusterung'' and the outstanding investigations of [[Walter Grotrian]] on the [[solar corona]] found recognition all over the world.\n\n=== Relocation of the Berlin Observatory to Babelsberg ===\n\n[[Image:Potsdam Astrophysical Institute.jpg|right|thumb|Institute buildings in [[Babelsberg]]]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the [[Berlin Observatory]], originally built outside the border of the town, was enclosed by blocks of flats, so scientific observations were almost impossible. Therefore, Foerster proposed the removal of the observatory to a place outside Berlin with better observational conditions. In 1904 he appointed [[Hermann Struve|Karl Hermann Struve]], former director of the observatory of K\u00f6nigsberg, as his successor to realize this project.\n\nAfter test observations by [[Paul Guthnick]] in the summer of 1906 a new site was found on a hill in the eastern part of the Royal Park of [[Babelsberg Park|Babelsberg]]. The ground was placed at the observatory's disposal by the crown free of charge. The costs of the new buildings and the new instruments amounted to 1.5 million Goldmark and could be covered by selling the landed property of the Berlin Observatory. The old observatory built by Schinkel was pulled down later. In June 1911 the construction of a new observatory began in Babelsberg and on 2 August 1913 the removal from Berlin to Babelsberg was complete.\n\nThe first new instruments were delivered in the spring of 1914. The 65&nbsp;cm [[Refracting telescope|refractor]]<ref name=\"ZEISS_REFRACTOR\">[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/Telescopes,_Instruments.Refraktor,_Babelsberg.html Zeiss refractor telescope] at AIP</ref> \u2014 the first big astronomical instrument manufactured by the famous enterprise of Carl Zeiss Jena \u2014 was mounted in 1915, whereas the completion of the 122&nbsp;cm reflector telescope<ref>[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/images/122cm.jpg 122 cm Reflecting Telescope] formerly in Babelsberg</ref> was delayed until 1924 by the First World War. Struve died in 1920 from an accident, and his successor was [[Paul Guthnick]], who introduced in 1913 photoelectric photometry into astronomy as the first objective method of measuring the brightness of stars. When the 122&nbsp;cm telescope (at this time the second largest in the world) was finished, the Babelsberg Observatory was the best-equipped observatory of Europe.\n\nThe development of the photoelectric method for investigating weakly variable stars and spectroscopic investigations with the 122&nbsp;cm telescope made the Babelsberg observatory well-known beyond Europe, too.\n\nAt the beginning of 1931 the [[Sonneberg Observatory]] founded by [[Cuno Hoffmeister]] was attached to the Babelsberg Observatory. For more than 60 years a photographic sky survey was carried out, which represents the second largest archive of astronomical photographic plates. This archive and the discovery and investigation of [[variable star]]s popularized the name Sonneberg all over the astronomical world.\n\nWith the beginning of the fascist regime, the fortunes of astronomy in Potsdam as well as in Babelsberg started to decline. The banishment of Jewish co-workers played an essential role in this process. The beginning of the Second World War practically marked the cessation of astronomical research.\n\n=== Developments after the Second World War ===\n[[File:Babelsberg telescope.jpg|thumb|right|The 122&nbsp;cm Babelsberg telescope in [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory|CrAO]].]]\nThe new start after the war was very difficult. In Potsdam the [[Einstein Tower]] had suffered heavy damage by bombs, in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]] valuable instruments, among them the 122&nbsp;cm telescope (whose former building now houses the AIP library), were dismounted and removed to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Now the 122&nbsp;cm telescope works in the [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory]].\n\nIn January 1947 the German Academy of Sciences took the AOP and the Babelsberg Observatory under its administration, but it was not until the beginning of the 1950s before astronomical research started anew.\n\nAOP director Hans Kienle took over the editorial duties of the professional journal [[Astronomische Nachrichten|Astronomical Notes]] (German: [[Astronomische Nachrichten]]), which is to this day edited at the AIP and moreover the oldest professional journal for astronomy.\n\nIn June 1954 the Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\">[http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/english/en_observatory.html Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923202618/http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/english/en_observatory.html |date=2018-09-23 }} \u2013 OSRA</ref> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf (17&nbsp;km southeast of Potsdam) began its work as a part of the AOP. Its history started in 1896: after the discovery of the radio waves by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1888, [[Johannes Wilsing]] and [[Julius Scheiner]], fellows of the AOP, tried to detect radio emission from the Sun. They did not succeed, because of the low sensitivity of their equipment. After the Second World War Herbert Daene started once again to attempt radio observations of the Sun in Babelsberg which were continued in Tremsdorf.\n\nIn October 1960 the 2&nbsp;m telescope built by Carl Zeiss Jena was inaugurated in the [[Tautenburg]] Forest near Jena and the new [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] was founded. The Schmidt variant of this telescope is to this day the largest astronomical wide-field camera in the world and it was the main observational instrument of the astronomers of the GDR.\n\nIn 1969 the four East-German astronomical institutes, Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam, Babelsberg Observatory, the Thuringian [[Sonneberg Observatory]], and [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] [[Tautenburg]], were joined in the course of academy reform to the Central Institute of Astrophysics of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. The solar observatory [[Einstein Tower]] and Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy were affiliated later.\n\nOne part of the scientific activities concerned cosmic magnetic fields and cosmic dynamos, phenomena of [[Sun#Convection zone|turbulence]], [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic and eruptive processes]] on the Sun, explosive energy dissipation processes in plasmas, [[variable stars]] and stellar activity. Another part was directed to the early phases of [[cosmic evolution]] and the origin of [[Large-scale structure of the universe|structures in the Universe]], large-scale structures up to those of [[supercluster]]s and to [[Active galactic nucleus|active galaxies]]. In this connection special methods of image processing have been developed. In addition, investigations in [[astrometry]] have also been performed.\n\nThe scientific work of the Central Institute for Astrophysics suffered strongly from the isolation of the GDR from the western world. It was very difficult to come into contact with western colleagues. After the autumn 1989 [[Berlin Wall#The fall, 1989|fall of the Berlin Wall]], new possibilities at once arose.\n\n=== Reunification and the founding of the AIP ===\n\nOn the basis of the prescriptions of the Unification Agreement for the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] of the [[East Germany|GDR]], the Central Institute of Astrophysics was dissolved on 31 December 1991. On the recommendation of the Science Council on 1 January 1992 the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, with a greatly reduced staff, was founded.  It occupies the former Babelsberg Observatory site in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg]].\n\nThe [[Sonneberg Observatory]] and the [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] are no longer affiliated with the AIP, but the AIP still operates the Observatory for Solar Rado Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\" /> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf and maintains the Great Refractor<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\" /> and [[Einstein Tower]] at Telegrafenberg.\n\nSince then, the AIP has broadened its research areas, initiated several new technical projects, and participates in several large international research projects (see below).\n\nOn April 15, 2011, the name of the AIP was changed to \"Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam\", to \nemphasize the affiliation of the institute with the Leibniz Association.  The institute retains the abbreviation \n\"AIP\", as well as the \"aip.de\" Internet domain.\n\n== Main research areas ==\n\n* [[Magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD): Magnetic fields and turbulence in stars, accretion disks and galaxies; computer simulations ao dynamos, magnetic instabilities and magnetic convection\n* [[Solar physics]]: Observation of sunspots and of solar magnetic field with spectro-polarimetry; [[Helioseismology]] and hydrodynamic numerical models; Study of coronal plasma processes by means of radio astronomy; Operation of the Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\" /> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf, with four radio antennas in different frequency bands from 40&nbsp;MHz to 800&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Stellar physics]]: Numerical simulations of convection in stellar atmospheres, determination of stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances, winds and dust shells of red giants; Doppler tomography of stellar surface structures, development of robotic telescopes, as well as simulation of magnetic flux tubes\n* [[Star#Formation and evolution|Star formation]] and the [[interstellar medium]]: Brown dwarfs and low-mass stars, circumstellar disks, Origin of double and multiple-star systems\n* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s: Mother galaxies and surroundings of quasars, development of quasars and active galactic cores, structure and the story of the origin of the Milky Way, numerical computer simulations of the origin and development of galaxies\n* [[Cosmology]]: Numerical simulation of the formation of large-scale structures.

Grahams in Arizona. The LBT consists of 2 huge 8.4 m telescopes on a common mount. With their 110 square meter area, the LBT is the largest telescope in the world on a single mount, only surpassed by the combined VLTs and Kecks.\n\n=== RAVE ===\n\nThe [[Radial Velocity Experiment]]<ref>[http://www.rave-survey.aip.de/rave/ Radial Velocity Experiment] \u2013 RAVE</ref> measures until 2010 the radial velocities and elemental abundances of a million stars, predominantly in the southern celestial hemisphere. The 6dF multi-object [[spectrograph]] on the 1.2&nbsp;m UK Schmidt telescope of the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]] will be applied for this purpose.\n\n=== Sloan Digital Sky Survey ===\n\nThe [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) will investigate in detail a quarter of the whole sky and determine the position and absolute brightness of more than 100 million sky objects. Besides that, the distances of more than a million galaxies and quasars will be estimated. With the help of this study, astronomers will be able to assess the distribution of large-scale structures in the Universe. This can provide hints about the story of the development of the Universe.\n\n=== LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) ===\n\n[[LOFAR]] is a European radio interferometer, that measures radio waves with many individual antennas in different places which it combines to a single signal.

It is a new type of solar telescope,  which supersedes the previous 45&nbsp;cm Gregory-Coud\u00e9 telescope. GREGOR is equipped with [[adaptive optics]] and will achieve a resolution of 70&nbsp;km of the Sun's surface. The investigation of these small structures is important for the understanding of the underlying processes of the interaction of magnetic fields with plasma turbulence on the Sun. The development of the Gregor telescope will be led by the Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS)<ref name=\"KIS\">[http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS)]</ref> with the participation of several institutes. The telescope is named after [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]], the inventor of the [[Gregorian telescope]].\n\n=== AGWs of the Large Binocular Telescope ===\n\nThe AIP is a partner in the LBT Consortium (LBTC) and contributes financially and materially in the construction of the [[Large Binocular Telescope]]. This entails both the development and the fabrication of the optics and the mechanical and electronic components as well as the development of the software for the acquisition, guiding and wavefront sensing units<ref name=\"AGWs\">[http://www.aip.de/groups/lbt/AGW.html AGW-units] for the LBT by the AIP</ref> (AGWs).

It is the successor of the [[Berlin Observatory]] founded in 1700 and of the [[Astrophysical Institute Potsdam#Foundation of the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam .28AOP.29|Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam]] (AOP) founded in 1874. The latter was the world's first observatory to emphasize explicitly the research area of [[astrophysics]].  The AIP was founded in 1992, in a re-structuring following the [[German reunification]].\n\nThe AIP is privately funded and member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]]. It is located in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]] in the state of [[Brandenburg]], just west of [[Berlin]], though the [[Einstein Tower]] solar observatory and the great [[Refracting telescope|refractor telescope]]<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\">[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/Telegrafenberg_Observatory.Grosser_Refraktor.html Great Refractor telescope] at Telegrafenberg</ref> on [[Telegrafenberg]] in [[Potsdam]] belong to the AIP.\n\nThe key topics of the AIP are cosmic [[magnetic field]]s ([[magnetohydrodynamics]]) on various scales and [[extragalactic astrophysics]].  Astronomical and astrophysical fields studied at the AIP range from [[Solar physics|solar]] and [[stellar physics]] to [[Stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]] to [[cosmology]].\n\nThe institute also develops research technology in the fields of [[spectroscopy]] and [[robotic telescope]]s.  It is a partner of the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] in Arizona, has erected robotic telescopes in [[Tenerife]] and the Antarctic, develops astronomical instrumentation for large telescopes such as the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] of the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]].  Furthermore, work on several [[e-Science]] projects<ref name=\"E-SCIENCE\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aip.de/groups/escience/ |title=e-Science at the AIP |access-date=2009-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181455/http://www.aip.de/groups/escience/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are carried out at the AIP.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe history of astronomy in [[Potsdam]] really began in Berlin in 1700. Initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried W. Leibniz]], on July 11, 1700 the \"Brandenburgische Societ\u00e4t\" (later called the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]) was founded by the elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich III]] in Berlin. Two months earlier the national calendar monopoly provided the funding for an observatory. By May 18 the first director, [[Gottfried Kirch]], had been appointed. This happened in a hurry, because the profits from the national basic calendar, calculated and sold by the observatory, should have been the financial source for the academy. This kind of financing existed until the beginning of the 19th century, but the basic calendar was calculated until very recently (it stopped after the ''[[Die Wende|Wende]]'' in 1991).\n\n[[Image:Sternwarte Berlin Schinkel.jpg|thumb|200px|Alte ''New [[Berliner Sternwarte]]'' at Linden Street]]\n\nIn 1711 the first observatory was built in Dorotheen Street in Berlin and in 1835 a new observatory building, which was designed by the famous architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], was completed in Linden Street (near Hallesches Tor). [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was then promoting astronomy by his famous \"Kosmos\" lectures in 1827\u201328. He played an important role in providing the funds for both observatory and instruments.\n\nThe [[Berlin Observatory]] became known worldwide when [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] discovered the planet [[Neptune]] in 1846. The discoveries of the [[Anode ray|canal rays]] by [[Eugen Goldstein]] in 1886 in the physical laboratory of the observatory and of the variation in the altitude of the Earth's pole by [[Karl Friedrich K\u00fcstner]] in 1888 were likewise important.\n\nThe last two scientific events took place when [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]] was director of the observatory, which was meanwhile attached to the University of Berlin. He prepared the basis for the astronomical observatories in Potsdam: in 1874 the foundation of the AOP on the Telegrafenberg and in 1913 the removal of the Berlin Observatory to Babelsberg.\n\n=== Foundation of the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam (AOP) ===\n[[Image:AOP-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ''Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam'' isn't used as observatory any more. Nowadays it hosts the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] as part of the [[Albert Einstein Science Park]]]]\n[[Image:L-Observatorium.png|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of the ''Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam'']]\n[[Image:Great Refractor Potsdam.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The \"Gro\u00dfe Refraktor\" of 1899, a double telescope with a 80cm (31.5\") and 50 cm (19.5\") lenses]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] was developed by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]]. It enabled the acquisition of information on the physical parameters and chemical abundances of stars, by the spectral analysis of their light. Foerster recognized these possibilities and initiated the building of a solar observatory in 1871 as a memorial to the crown prince, in which he emphasized the importance and profit of solar research. This idea was soon extended to the whole of astrophysics.\n\nThe site of the observatory was chosen on a hill south of [[Potsdam]], the Telegrafenberg, on which had been, from 1832 to 1848, a relay station of the military telegraph from Berlin to Koblenz. On 1 July 1874 the AOP was founded. Even before the construction of the observatory had started in the autumn of 1876, solar observations were being made from the tower of the former military orphanage in Linden Street in Potsdam by [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer]]. The construction work started in 1876; the main observatory building and its equipment were finished in the autumn of 1879.\n\nThe AOP was managed by a board of directors comprising [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Arthur Auwers]]. In 1882 [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Carl Hermann Vogel]] was appointed as sole director of the observatory. The main focus of his work was now on stellar astrophysics. He was the first successfully to determine radial velocities of stars photographically and as a result he discovered the [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]].\n\nIn 1899 one of the biggest [[Refracting telescope|refractor]] in the world, [[Great Refractor]] of Potsdam,<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\" /> with lenses of 80 and 50&nbsp;cm, was manufactured by the firms of [[Carl August von Steinheil|Steinheil]] and [[Johann Georg Repsold|Repsold]], and mounted in a 24&nbsp;m dome. It was inaugurated in a great celebration by the German emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. Although it did not realize all the hopes astronomers had for it, nevertheless two important discoveries should be mentioned: the [[Interstellar medium#The history of knowledge of interstellar space|interstellar calcium lines]] in the spectrum of the spectroscopic binary [[Delta Orionis]] by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904<ref>{{cite journal | title=Investigations on the spectrum and orbit of delta Orionis | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1904ApJ....19..268H | last1=Hartmann | first1=J. | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=19 | pages=268\u2013286 | year=1904 | bibcode=1904ApJ....19..268H | doi=10.1086/141112 }}</ref> and the presence of stellar calcium emission lines \u2014 a hint of stellar surface activity \u2014 by [[Gustav Eberhard]] and [[Hans Ludendorff]] about 1900.\n{{further|Potsdam Great Refractor}}\n\nTen years later one of the most famous astrophysicists of this century, [[Karl Schwarzschild]], became director of the observatory. In only a few years of work (by 1916 he had died from a chronic illness) he had made fundamental contributions in astrophysics and to [[General relativity|General Relativity Theory]]. Only a few weeks after the theory's publication by Einstein, Schwarzschild found the first solution of the [[Einstein field equations|Einstein equations]], which is now named after him as the \"[[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]]\" and which is of fundamental importance for the theory of black holes.\n\nThere exist further close links between the AOP and Einstein's Relativity Theory. In 1881 [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Albert A. Michelson]] first performed his [[interferometer]] experiments<ref>[http://www.aip.de/pr/Michelson.e.html The Michelson experiment in Potsdam]</ref> in the cellar of the main building of the AOP, that were to disprove the movement of the Earth through a hypothetical [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. His negative results were fundamentally reconciled only through Einstein's [[Special Relativity]] theory of 1905.\n\n[[Image:Einsteinturm 7443.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Einstein Tower]] at Telegrafenberg today. By [[Erich Mendelsohn]]]]\nTo prove the [[gravitational redshift]] of spectral lines of the Sun \u2014 an effect proposed by Einstein's theory of General Relativity \u2014 was the aim of a [[Einstein Tower|solar tower telescope]], which was built from 1921 to 1924 at the instigation of [[Erwin Finlay-Freundlich]]. Though at that time it was not yet technically possible to measure the gravitational redshift, important developments in solar and plasma physics were started here and the architect, [[Erich Mendelsohn]], created with this peculiarly expressionistic tower a unique scientific building.\n\nBesides the work of Schwarzschild, in the following decades important observational programmes such as the ''Potsdamer Photometrische Durchmusterung'' and the outstanding investigations of [[Walter Grotrian]] on the [[corona|solar corona]] found recognition all over the world.\n\n=== Relocation of the Berlin Observatory to Babelsberg ===\n\n[[Image:Potsdam Astrophysical Institute.jpg|right|thumb|Institute buildings in [[Babelsberg]]]]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the [[Berlin Observatory]], originally built outside the border of the town, was enclosed by blocks of flats, so scientific observations were almost impossible. Therefore, Foerster proposed the removal of the observatory to a place outside Berlin with better observational conditions. In 1904 he appointed [[Hermann Struve|Karl Hermann Struve]], former director of the observatory of K\u00f6nigsberg, as his successor to realize this project.\n\nAfter test observations by [[Paul Guthnick]] in the summer of 1906 a new site was found on a hill in the eastern part of the Royal Park of [[Babelsberg Park|Babelsberg]]. The ground was placed at the observatory's disposal by the crown free of charge. The costs of the new buildings and the new instruments amounted to 1.5 million Goldmark and could be covered by selling the landed property of the Berlin Observatory. The old observatory built by Schinkel was pulled down later. In June 1911 the construction of a new observatory began in Babelsberg and on 2 August 1913 the removal from Berlin to Babelsberg was complete.\n\nThe first new instruments were delivered in the spring of 1914. The 65&nbsp;cm [[Refracting telescope|refractor]]<ref name=\"ZEISS_REFRACTOR\">[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/Telescopes,_Instruments.Refraktor,_Babelsberg.html Zeiss refractor telescope] at AIP</ref> \u2014 the first big astronomical instrument manufactured by the famous enterprise of Carl Zeiss Jena \u2014 was mounted in 1915, whereas the completion of the 122&nbsp;cm reflector telescope<ref>[http://www.aip.de/image_archive/images/122cm.jpg 122 cm Reflecting Telescope] formerly in Babelsberg</ref> was delayed until 1924 by the First World War. Struve died in 1920 from an accident, and his successor was [[Paul Guthnick]], who introduced in 1913 photoelectric photometry into astronomy as the first objective method of measuring the brightness of stars. When the 122&nbsp;cm telescope (at this time the second largest in the world) was finished, the Babelsberg Observatory was the best-equipped observatory of Europe.\n\nThe development of the photoelectric method for investigating weakly variable stars and spectroscopic investigations with the 122&nbsp;cm telescope made the Babelsberg observatory well-known beyond Europe, too.\n\nAt the beginning of 1931 the [[Sonneberg Observatory]] founded by [[Cuno Hoffmeister]] was attached to the Babelsberg Observatory. For more than 60 years a photographic sky survey was carried out, which represents the second largest archive of astronomical photographic plates. This archive and the discovery and investigation of [[variable star]]s popularized the name Sonneberg all over the astronomical world.\n\nWith the beginning of the fascist regime, the fortunes of astronomy in Potsdam as well as in Babelsberg started to decline. The banishment of Jewish co-workers played an essential role in this process. The beginning of the Second World War practically marked the cessation of astronomical research.\n\n=== Developments after the Second World War ===\n[[File:Babelsberg telescope.jpg|thumb|right|The 122&nbsp;cm Babelsberg telescope in [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory|CrAO]].]]\nThe new start after the war was very difficult. In Potsdam the [[Einstein Tower]] had suffered heavy damage by bombs, in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]] valuable instruments, among them the 122&nbsp;cm telescope (whose former building now houses the AIP library), were dismounted and removed to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Now the 122&nbsp;cm telescope works in the [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory]].\n\nIn January 1947 the German Academy of Sciences took the AOP and the Babelsberg Observatory under its administration, but it was not until the beginning of the 1950s before astronomical research started anew.\n\nAOP director Hans Kienle took over the editorial duties of the professional journal [[Astronomische Nachrichten|Astronomical Notes]] (German: [[Astronomische Nachrichten]]), which is to this day edited at the AIP and moreover the oldest professional journal for astronomy.\n\nIn June 1954 the Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\">[http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/english/en_observatory.html Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923202618/http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/english/en_observatory.html |date=2018-09-23 }} \u2013 OSRA</ref> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf (17&nbsp;km southeast of Potsdam) began its work as a part of the AOP. Its history started in 1896: after the discovery of the radio waves by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1888, [[Johannes Wilsing]] and [[Julius Scheiner]], fellows of the AOP, tried to detect radio emission from the Sun. They did not succeed, because of the low sensitivity of their equipment. After the Second World War Herbert Daene started once again to attempt radio observations of the Sun in Babelsberg which were continued in Tremsdorf.\n\nIn October 1960 the 2&nbsp;m telescope built by Carl Zeiss Jena was inaugurated in the [[Tautenburg]] Forest near Jena and the new [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] was founded. The Schmidt variant of this telescope is to this day the largest astronomical wide-field camera in the world and it was the main observational instrument of the astronomers of the GDR.\n\nIn 1969 the four East-German astronomical institutes, Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam, Babelsberg Observatory, the Thuringian [[Sonneberg Observatory]], and [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] [[Tautenburg]], were joined in the course of academy reform to the Central Institute of Astrophysics of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. The solar observatory [[Einstein Tower]] and Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy were affiliated later.\n\nOne part of the scientific activities concerned cosmic magnetic fields and cosmic dynamos, phenomena of [[Sun#Convection zone|turbulence]], [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic and eruptive processes]] on the Sun, explosive energy dissipation processes in plasmas, [[variable stars]] and stellar activity. Another part was directed to the early phases of [[cosmic evolution]] and the origin of [[Large-scale structure of the universe|structures in the Universe]], large-scale structures up to those of [[supercluster]]s and to [[Active galactic nucleus|active galaxies]]. In this connection special methods of image processing have been developed. In addition, investigations in [[astrometry]] have also been performed.\n\nThe scientific work of the Central Institute for Astrophysics suffered strongly from the isolation of the GDR from the western world. It was very difficult to come into contact with western colleagues. After the autumn 1989 [[Berlin Wall#The fall, 1989|fall of the Berlin Wall]], new possibilities at once arose.\n\n=== Reunification and the founding of the AIP ===\n\nOn the basis of the prescriptions of the Unification Agreement for the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] of the [[East Germany|GDR]], the Central Institute of Astrophysics was dissolved on 31 December 1991. On the recommendation of the Science Council on 1 January 1992 the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, with a greatly reduced staff, was founded.  It occupies the former Babelsberg Observatory site in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg]].\n\nThe [[Sonneberg Observatory]] and the [[Karl Schwarzschild Observatory]] are no longer affiliated with the AIP, but the AIP still operates the Observatory for Solar Rado Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\" /> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf and maintains the Great Refractor<ref name=\"Refractor_Telegrafenberg\" /> and [[Einstein Tower]] at Telegrafenberg.\n\nSince then, the AIP has broadened its research areas, initiated several new technical projects, and participates in several large international research projects (see below).\n\nOn April 15, 2011, the name of the AIP was changed to \"Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam\", to \nemphasize the affiliation of the institute with the Leibniz Association.  The institute retains the abbreviation \n\"AIP\", as well as the \"aip.de\" Internet domain.\n\n== Main research areas ==\n\n* [[Magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD): Magnetic fields and turbulence in stars, accretion disks and galaxies; computer simulations ao dynamos, magnetic instabilities and magnetic convection\n* [[Solar physics]]: Observation of sunspots and of solar magnetic field with spectro-polarimetry; [[Helioseismology]] and hydrodynamic numerical models; Study of coronal plasma processes by means of radio astronomy; Operation of the Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy<ref name=\"osra\" /> (OSRA) in Tremsdorf, with four radio antennas in different frequency bands from 40&nbsp;MHz to 800&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Stellar physics]]: Numerical simulations of convection in stellar atmospheres, determination of stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances, winds and dust shells of red giants; Doppler tomography of stellar surface structures, development of robotic telescopes, as well as simulation of magnetic flux tubes\n* [[Star#Formation and evolution|Star formation]] and the [[interstellar medium]]: Brown dwarfs and low-mass stars, circumstellar disks, Origin of double and multiple-star systems\n* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s: Mother galaxies and surroundings of quasars, development of quasars and active galactic cores, structure and the story of the origin of the Milky Way, numerical computer simulations of the origin and development of galaxies\n* [[Cosmology]]: Numerical simulation of the formation of large-scale structures. Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution. Predictions for future large observational surveys.\n\n== Participation in large international research projects ==\n\n=== Large Binocular Telescope ===\n[[Image:LBT-Gebaeude.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Large Binocular Telescope]] in [[Arizona]]]]\n\nThe [[Large Binocular Telescope]] (LBT) is a new telescope on Mt. Grahams in Arizona. The LBT consists of 2 huge 8.4 m telescopes on a common mount. With their 110 square meter area, the LBT is the largest telescope in the world on a single mount, only surpassed by the combined VLTs and Kecks.\n\n=== RAVE ===\n\nThe [[Radial Velocity Experiment]]<ref>[http://www.rave-survey.aip.de/rave/ Radial Velocity Experiment] \u2013 RAVE</ref> measures until 2010 the radial velocities and elemental abundances of a million stars, predominantly in the southern celestial hemisphere. The 6dF multi-object [[spectrograph]] on the 1.2&nbsp;m UK Schmidt telescope of the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]] will be applied for this purpose.\n\n=== Sloan Digital Sky Survey ===\n\nThe [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) will investigate in detail a quarter of the whole sky and determine the position and absolute brightness of more than 100 million sky objects. Besides that, the distances of more than a million galaxies and quasars will be estimated. With the help of this study, astronomers will be able to assess the distribution of large-scale structures in the Universe. This can provide hints about the story of the development of the Universe.\n\n=== LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) ===\n\n[[LOFAR]] is a European radio interferometer, that measures radio waves with many individual antennas in different places which it combines to a single signal. One of these international [[LOFAR]] stations will be presently constructed by the AIP in Bornim by Potsdam.\n\n== Technical projects ==\n\n=== Virtual observatory ===\n\nThe German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory<ref name=\"GAVO\">[http://www.g-vo.org/www/ GAVO] \u2013 German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory</ref> (GAVO) is an [[e-Science]] project,<ref name=\"E-SCIENCE\" /> that creates a virtual observation platform to support modern astrophysical research in Germany. It is the German contribution to international efforts to establish a general [[Virtual Observatory]]. GAVO enables standardized access to German and international data archives.\n\n=== GREGOR ===\n[[Image:Solar Telescope GREGOR.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Solar telescope GREGOR]]\n\nGREGOR<ref name=\"GREGOR\">[http://gregor.kis.uni-freiburg.de/ GREGOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406004817/http://gregor.kis.uni-freiburg.de/ |date=2005-04-06 }} \u2013 solar telescope</ref> is a 1.5&nbsp;m telescope for solar research of the [[Teide Observatory]] on Tenerife. It is a new type of solar telescope,  which supersedes the previous 45&nbsp;cm Gregory-Coud\u00e9 telescope. GREGOR is equipped with [[adaptive optics]] and will achieve a resolution of 70&nbsp;km of the Sun's surface. The investigation of these small structures is important for the understanding of the underlying processes of the interaction of magnetic fields with plasma turbulence on the Sun. The development of the Gregor telescope will be led by the Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS)<ref name=\"KIS\">[http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS)]</ref> with the participation of several institutes. The telescope is named after [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]], the inventor of the [[Gregorian telescope]].\n\n=== AGWs of the Large Binocular Telescope ===\n\nThe AIP is a partner in the LBT Consortium (LBTC) and contributes financially and materially in the construction of the [[Large Binocular Telescope]]. This entails both the development and the fabrication of the optics and the mechanical and electronic components as well as the development of the software for the acquisition, guiding and wavefront sensing units<ref name=\"AGWs\">[http://www.aip.de/groups/lbt/AGW.html AGW-units] for the LBT by the AIP</ref> (AGWs). The AGW units are essential components of the telescope and indispensable for the [[adaptive optics]].\n\n=== Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer ===\n{{main|Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer}}\nThe Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer<ref name=\"MUSE\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aip.de/groups/muse/ |title=Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer - MUSE |access-date=2009-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220082215/http://www.aip.de/groups/muse/ |archive-date=2009-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (MUSE) is an instrument of the second generation for the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] of the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]. MUSE is optimized for the observation of normal galaxies out to very high redshift. It will furthermore deliver detailed studies of nearby normal, interacting, and starburst galaxies.\n\n=== Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric & Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) ===\n\nPEPSI<ref>[http://www.aip.de/pepsi/ PEPSI] \u2013 instrument for the LBT</ref> is a high-resolution [[spectrograph]] for the [[Large Binocular Telescope|LBT]].  It will enable the simultaneous observation of circularly and linearly polarized light with high spectral and temporal resolution.  The spectrograph is situated in a temperature- and pressure-stabilized room within the telescope column.  The light will be conducted by fiber optics from the telescope to the spectrograph.\n\n=== STELLA ===\n[[Image:Stella-robotic-observatory.jpg|thumb|200px|STELLA Robotic Observatory on [[Tenerife]]]]\n\nSTELLA<ref name=\"STELLA\">[http://www.aip.de/stella STELLA robotic observatory]</ref> is a robotic observatory that consists of two 1.2&nbsp;m telescopes. It is a long-term project to observe indicators of stellar activity of Sun-like stars. The operation occurs unattended \u2014 the telescopes decide the appropriate observation strategy automatically.\n\n=== Observatory for Solar Radio Astronomy (OSRA) ===\n[[Image:Astro Tremsdorf1.JPG|thumb|200px|OSRA Radio Antenna in [[Tremsdorf]]]]\n\nThe robotic radio observatory OSRA<ref name=\"osra\" /> will record radio emissions of the Sun's corona with four different four antennas in the frequency bands 40\u2013100&nbsp;MHz, 100\u2013170&nbsp;MHz, 200\u2013400&nbsp;MHz and 400\u2013800&nbsp;MHz.

The satellite operated until it was destroyed in orbit on September 13, 1985 to test the [[ASM-135 ASAT]] anti-satellite missile.\n\n== Construction and payload ==\nThe satellite's [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO) platform included a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. [[Ball Aerospace]] was the primary contractor for design and construction, and provided the [[attitude control]] and determination computer programs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070612043842/http://www.robins.ball.com/p78.html Space Test Program P78-1 at Ball Aerospace]</ref> The P78-1 carried a [[gamma-ray]] [[spectrometer]], a white-light [[coronagraph]], an extreme-[[ultraviolet]] imager, an [[X-ray]] [[spectrometer]], a high-latitude particle spectrometer, an [[aerosol]] monitor, and an [[X-ray]] monitor. The X-ray monitor, designated NRL-608 or XMON, was a collaboration between the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. The white-light [[coronagraph]] and the ultraviolet imager were combined in a single package, designated NRL-401 or SOLWIND, which was built by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].  The coronagraph was the flight spare of the white-light coronagraph on the [[OSO-7]] satellite.  The ultraviolet imager used a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] imager, one of the first uses of a CCD in space.\n\n== Discovery of comets ==\n\nP78-1 was the first satellite in space to discover a comet in general and a [[sungrazing comet]] in particular. In total, 9 sungrazing comets, all belonging to the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz group]], were discovered on images taken by the Solwind coronagraph:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Designation !!

Its [[perihelion distance]] of 0.1051 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] was at least ten times larger than that of the previously found true sungrazers.\n\n== Destruction ==\nBy 1985, the satellite's batteries were degrading. This caused more and more frequent \"under-voltage cutoffs\", a condition where the satellite detected a low main bus voltage and automatically shut down all non-vital systems. In addition, the last of the three tape recorders failed in the spring of 1985, so data collection could only occur while the spacecraft was in contact with a ground station.<ref name=gunter /> A normal contact lasted only about 15 minutes, so this was a serious impediment.  Special arrangements could be made to string several contacts together.  As a result of these failures, an ever-increasing amount of time and network resources were spent reconfiguring the satellite for normal operation. Data collection from the few remaining payloads was severely limited. Because of the additional burden on the [[Air Force Satellite Control Network]] (e.g., extra support and antenna time at the tracking stations), discussions were already underway to terminate the mission.\n\nThis led to the satellite being chosen as a test target for an [[ASM-135 ASAT]] anti-satellite missile. The mission was extended for several weeks solely to support the test. During this final phase, the satellite was often allowed to remain in the under-voltage condition for several days at a time.\n\nOn September 13, 1985, the satellite was destroyed in orbit at 2043 [[UTC]] at {{coord|35|N|126|W||display=inline}} with an altitude of {{convert|525|km|mi}}<ref name=\"NASA 2008\" /> by an ASM-135 ASAT launched from a [[US Air Force]] [[F-15 Eagle]] [[fighter aircraft]]. The test resulted in 285 cataloged pieces of [[space debris|orbital debris]]. 1 piece of debris remained in orbit to at least May 2004,<ref>{{cite book |url=

although five of P78-1's instruments had failed at the time of the test, two instruments remained in operation, and the satellite was what one [[solar physics|solar]] [[physicist]] called \"the

24, 1979. The satellite operated until it was destroyed in orbit on September 13, 1985 to test the [[ASM-135 ASAT]] anti-satellite missile.\n\n== Construction and payload ==\nThe satellite's [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO) platform included a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. [[Ball Aerospace]] was the primary contractor for design and construction, and provided the [[attitude control]] and determination computer programs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070612043842/http://www.robins.ball.com/p78.html Space Test Program P78-1 at Ball Aerospace]</ref> The P78-1 carried a [[gamma-ray]] [[spectrometer]], a white-light [[coronagraph]], an extreme-[[ultraviolet]] imager, an [[X-ray]] [[spectrometer]], a high-latitude particle spectrometer, an [[aerosol]] monitor, and an [[X-ray]] monitor. The X-ray monitor, designated NRL-608 or XMON, was a collaboration between the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. The white-light [[coronagraph]] and the ultraviolet imager were combined in a single package, designated NRL-401 or SOLWIND, which was built by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].  The coronagraph was the flight spare of the white-light coronagraph on the [[OSO-7]] satellite.  The ultraviolet imager used a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] imager, one of the first uses of a CCD in space.\n\n== Discovery of comets ==\n\nP78-1 was the first satellite in space to discover a comet in general and a [[sungrazing comet]] in particular. In total, 9 sungrazing comets, all belonging to the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz group]], were discovered on images taken by the Solwind coronagraph:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Designation !!

Its [[perihelion distance]] of 0.1051 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] was at least ten times larger than that of the previously found true sungrazers.\n\n== Destruction ==\nBy 1985, the satellite's batteries were degrading. This caused more and more frequent \"under-voltage cutoffs\", a condition where the satellite detected a low main bus voltage and automatically shut down all non-vital systems. In addition, the last of the three tape recorders failed in the spring of 1985, so data collection could only occur while the spacecraft was in contact with a ground station.<ref name=gunter /> A normal contact lasted only about 15 minutes, so this was a serious impediment.  Special arrangements could be made to string several contacts together.  As a result of these failures, an ever-increasing amount of time and network resources were spent reconfiguring the satellite for normal operation. Data collection from the few remaining payloads was severely limited. Because of the additional burden on the [[Air Force Satellite Control Network]] (e.g., extra support and antenna time at the tracking stations), discussions were already underway to terminate the mission.\n\nThis led to the satellite being chosen as a test target for an [[ASM-135 ASAT]] anti-satellite missile. The mission was extended for several weeks solely to support the test. During this final phase, the satellite was often allowed to remain in the under-voltage condition for several days at a time.\n\nOn September 13, 1985, the satellite was destroyed in orbit at 2043 [[UTC]] at {{coord|35|N|126|W||display=inline}} with an altitude of {{convert|525|km|mi}}<ref name=\"NASA 2008\" /> by an ASM-135 ASAT launched from a [[US Air Force]] [[F-15 Eagle]] [[fighter aircraft]]. The test resulted in 285 cataloged pieces of [[space debris|orbital debris]]. 1 piece of debris remained in orbit to at least May 2004,<ref>{{cite book |url= http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/satellitefraghistory/13theditionofbreakupbook.pdf |title= History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations |edition= 13th |publisher= NASA Orbital Debris Program Office |pages= 12, 136 |date= May 2004 }}</ref> but had deorbited by 2008.<ref name=\"NASA 2008\">{{cite book |url= http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/SatelliteFragHistory/TM-2008-214779.pdf |title= History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations |edition= 14th |publisher= NASA Orbital Debris Program Office |pages= 15, 144 |date= May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe test outraged some scientists because although five of P78-1's instruments had failed at the time of the test, two instruments remained in operation, and the satellite was what one [[solar physics|solar]] [[physicist]] called \"the backbone of [[corona]]l research through the last seven years\".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Science News |date=Sep 28, 1985 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ASAT+target+was+working+research+satellite.-a03952265 |title=ASAT target was working research satellite |first=Jonathan |last=Eberhart}} <!-- alternate URL: https://archive.is/20120709124052/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_v128/ai_3952265/ --><!--official (paywalled) URL: https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/asat-target-was-working-research-satellite --></ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:ASM-135 ASAT 5.jpg|F-15A ''Celestial Eagle'' launching the ASAT missile that destroyed the P78-1\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test]]\n* [[USA 193]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/p78-1.html NASA page about the satellite]\n* [http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/biblio/p78-1_ads.html List of research papers based on P78-1 observations]\n* {{Webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120719001503/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&sd=01/01/1970&ed=12/31/1989 |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Air Force Link, Milestones Thursday, January 01, 1970 \u2013 Sunday, December 31, 1989}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105073429/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/solwind.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica Solwind Page]\n\n{{Sun spacecraft}}\n\n{{Orbital launches in 1979}}\n\n[[Category:NASA space probes]]\n[[Category:Intentionally destroyed artificial satellites]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 1979]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDestruction:post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solwind"}
