Since then, Australian crews have produced many films, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers started their careers in Australian films, many of whom have acquired international reputations, and a number of whom have found greater financial benefits in careers in larger film-producing centres, such as in the United States.\n\nThe first public screenings of films in Australia took place in October 1896, within a year of the world's first screening in Paris by [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The first Australian exhibition took place at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Hall]] in [[Collins Street, Melbourne]], to provide alternative entertainment for the dance-hall patrons. Commercially successful Australian films have included: ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', and [[Chris Noonan]]'s [[Babe (film) | ''Babe'']]. Other award-winning productions include [[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)| ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'']], [[Gallipoli (1981 film)| ''Gallipoli'']], [[The Tracker (2002 film)| ''The Tracker'']], [[Shine (film)| ''Shine'']] and ''[[Ten Canoes]]''.\n\nAustralian actors of renown include [[Errol Flynn]], [[Peter Finch]], [[Rod Taylor]], [[Paul Hogan]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Bryan Brown]], [[Judy Davis]], [[Jacki Weaver]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Anthony LaPaglia]], [[David Wenham]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Sam Worthington]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Sarah Snook]], [[Mia Wasikowska]] and [[Margot Robbie]].\n\nCinema in Australia is subject to [[censorship in Australia|censorship]], called classification, though films may be refused classification, resulting in them being effectively banned.\n\n==History==\nThe Australian film history has been characterized as one of 'boom and bust' due to the unstable and cyclical nature of its industry; there have been deep troughs when few films were made for decades and high peaks when a glut of films reached the market.<ref>David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Sydney: Pan Macmillan, 1990</ref>\n\n===Pioneer days \u2013 1890s\u20131910===\nThe [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athanaeum Hall]] in Collins Street, [[Melbourne]], was a dance hall from the 1880s, which from time to time would provide alternative entertainment to patrons. In October 1896, it exhibited the first [[movie film]] shown in Australia, within a year of the first public screening of a film in Paris on 28 December 1895 by the French [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The Athanaeum would continue screenings, but these early screenings were all short films.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSome of the earliest movie film shot in Australia consisted of films of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] dancers in [[Central Australia]], shot by anthropologists [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] and [[F.J. Gillen]] between 1900 and 1903. They pioneered [[sound recording]] on [[wax cylinder]]s and shot their films under very difficult conditions.<ref>{{cite dictionary| title = Spencer, Sir Walter Baldwin (1860\u20131929) | dictionary = Australian Dictionary of Biography|via=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University | url = http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120043b.htm | date = 14 July 1929 |accessdate=8 January 2020|quote=First published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, (MUP), 1990|first=D.J.|last=Mulvaney }}</ref>\n\nhe earliest [[feature length]], [[narrative film]] in the world was the Australian-produced ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), shown at the Athenaeum. The film was written and directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]] and included several of his family. The film was also exhibited in the United Kingdom, and was commercially very successful.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nMelbourne was also home of one of the world's first film studios, the [[Limelight Department]], operated by [[The Salvation Army]] between 1897 and 1910.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/limelight/docs/lime/default.htm |title=Information at ABS website |access-date=7 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903014817/http://www.abc.net.au/limelight/docs/lime/default.htm |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Limelight Department produced evangelical material for use by the Salvation Army, as well as private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it the largest film producer of its time. The major innovation of the Limelight Department came in 1899 when [[Herbert Booth]] and [[Joseph Perry (cinematographer)|Joseph Perry]] began work on ''Soldiers of the Cross'', described by some as the first feature-length film ever produced. ''Soldiers of the Cross'' fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film industry. The Limelight Department was commissioned to film the Federation of Australia.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Boom and bust \u2013 1910s\u20131920s===\nThe 1910s was a \"boom\" period in Australian cinema. It began slowly in the 1900s, and 1910 saw 4 narrative films released, then 51 in 1911, 30 in 1912, and 17 in 1913, and back to 4 in 1914, when the beginning of World War I brought an end to film making.<ref>Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900\u20131977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 1 \u2013 49</ref> While these numbers may seem small, Australia was one of the most prolific film-producing countries at the time. In all, between 1906 and 1928, 150 narrative feature films were made, of which almost 90 were made between 1910 and 1912.<ref>Albert Moran & Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 32</ref>\n\nThere was a general consolidation in the early 1910s in the production, distribution and exhibition of films in Australia which saw by 1912 the merger of numerous independent producers into [[Greater Union|Australasian Films and Union Theaters]] (now known as [[Event Cinemas]]) which established control over film distributors and cinemas and required smaller producers to deal with the cartel. Some view the arrangement as opening the way for American distributors in the 1920s to sign exclusive deals with Australian cinemas to exhibit only their products, thereby shutting out the local product and crippling the local film industry.<ref>''Australian screen'', http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/picture-show-man/clip1/</ref>\n\nThere are various other explanations for the decline of the industry in the 1920s. Some historians point to falling audience numbers, a lack of interest in Australian product and narratives, and Australia's participation in the war. Also, there was an [[Bushranger ban|official ban on bushranger films]] in 1912.<ref>Reade, Eric (1970) ''Australian Silent Films: A Pictorial History of Silent Films from 1896 to 1926''.

The banning of bushranger films in NSW is fictionalised in [[Kathryn Heyman]]'s 2006 novel, ''Captain Starlight's Apprentice''.</ref> With the suspension of local film production, Australian cinema chains sought alternative products in the United States and realised that Australian-produced films were much more expensive than the imported product, which were priced cheaply as production expenses had already been recouped in the home market. To redress this imbalance, the federal government imposed a tax on imported film in 1914, but this was removed by 1918.\n\nWhatever the explanation, by 1923, American films dominated the Australian market with 94% of all exhibited films coming from that country.<ref>Albert Moran & Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 30</ref>\n\n===1930s\u20131960s===\n[[File:Buladelah.jpg|thumb|left|The old Pacific Cinema at [[Bulahdelah, New South Wales]], a classic example of an early small country town cinema.]]\n\nIn 1930, [[F. W. Thring]] (1883\u20131936) established the [[Efftee Studios]] based in [[Melbourne]] to make talking films using optical sound equipment imported from the USA. The first sound films produced were in 1931, when the company produced ''[[Diggers (1931 film)|Diggers]]'' (1931), ''[[A Co-respondent's Course]]'' (1931), ''[[The Haunted Barn]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Sentimental Bloke (1932 film)|The Sentimental Bloke]]'' (1932). During the five years of its existence, Efftee produced nine features, over 80 shorts and several stage productions. Notable collaborators included [[C. J. Dennis]], [[George Wallace (Australian comedian)|George Wallace]] and [[Frank Harvey (Australian screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]]. Film production continued only until 1934, when it ceased as a protest over the refusal of the Australian government to set Australian film quotas, followed soon by Thring's death.

It was particularly successful with the ''[[On Our Selection (1932 film)|On Our Selection]]'' (1932) series of comedies, based on the popular writings of author [[Steele Rudd]], which featured the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, '[[Dad and Dave]]'. Despite its ambitions, Cinesound produced only 17 feature films, all but one being directed by Ken Hall. The company was financially successful.

Rafferty's onscreen image as a lanky, laconic bushman struck a chord with filmgoers and he appeared in iconic early Australian films such as ''[[Forty Thousand Horsemen]]'', ''[[The Rats of Tobruk (1944 film)|The Rats of Tobruk]]'', ''[[The Overlanders (film)|The Overlanders]]'' and ''[[Eureka Stockade (1949 film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (''Overlanders'' and ''Eureka'' were part of a series of Australian themed films produced by Britain's iconic [[Ealing Studios]]). In Hollywood, Rafferty also appeared in Australian themed films, including ''[[The Desert Rats (film)|The Desert Rats]]'', ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' and ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. Similarly, Peter Finch starred in quintessentially Australian roles (such as ''Digger'' or stockman) through a series of popular films and had a successful and diverse screen career in Britain and the United States.\n\nBoth [[Ron Randell]] and [[Rod Taylor]] began their acting careers in Australia initially in radio and on stage before appearing in such Australian films as ''[[Smithy (1946 film)|Smithy]]'' (1946) for the former and ''[[Long John Silver (film)|Long John Silver]]'' (1954) for the latter before transferring to the United States to become Hollywood leading men in a number of films of the late 1940s (Randell) and both from the 1950s onwards' Taylor had with starring roles in ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) as well as several American TV series such as ''[[Hong Kong (TV series)|Hong Kong]]''.\n\nSeveral notable films based on stories from [[Australian literature]] (generally with strong rural themes) were made in Australia in the 1950s \u2013 but by British and American production companies, including ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' (1956) which starred [[Virginia McKenna]] and Peter Finch; ''[[The Shiralee (1957 film)|The Shiralee]]'' (1957) also starring Peter Finch with Australian actors [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Kerr]] and [[Ed Devereaux]] in supporting roles; ''[[Robbery Under Arms (1957 film)|Robbery Under Arms]]'', again starring Finch in 1957; and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1959), starring [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[John Mills]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]; and in 1960, ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' was shot partly in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of [[New South Wales]] with foreign leads [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] but a supporting cast including Australians Chips Rafferty, [[John Meillon]] and [[Leonard Teale]].\n\nIn 1958, the [[Australian Film Institute]] was formed and in the same year began awarding the [[Australian Film Institute Awards]].\n\nAustralian film production was reaching a low ebb with few notable productions during the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&Section=Past_Winners |title=The Australian Film Institute &#124; Past Winners |access-date=29 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723062132/http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&Section=Past_Winners |archive-date=23 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The 1966 comedy ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'', starring [[Walter Chiari]], [[Chips Rafferty]] and [[Claire Dunne]] was a rare hit of the period which also documented something of the changing face of Australian society: telling the story of a newly arrived Italian immigrant who, working as a labourer in Sydney, becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with [[Australian slang]] and culture. The film foreshadowed the successful approaching \"[[Australian New Wave|New Wave]]\" of Australian cinema of the 1970s that would often showcase colloquial Australian culture.\n\nThere continued to be an appeal for Australian actors in Hollywood as \"action-men\", with the casting of Australian [[George Lazenby]] to replace [[Sean Connery]] portraying the superspy [[James Bond]] in the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\n===Film renaissance \u2013 1970s and 1980s===\n[[File:JohnGorton1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] initiated several avenues of government support for Australian cinema.]]\n\n[[John Gorton]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1968\u20131971, initiated several forms of government support for film and the arts. The [[Gough Whitlam]] government (1972\u201375) continued to support Australian film and state governments also established assistance programs. These measures led to the resurgence of Australian film called the [[Australian New Wave]], which lasted until the mid-late [[Australian films of the 1980s|1980s]]. The era also marked the emergence of the \"[[Ozploitation]]\" style \u2013 characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.\n\nFilms such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' ([[Peter Weir]], 1975) and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' ([[Ken Hannam]], 1975) made an impact on the international arena. The 1970s and '80s are regarded by many as a 'golden age' of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the dark dystopian fiction of ''[[Mad Max]]'' ([[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], 1979) to the romantic comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' ([[Peter Faiman]], 1986) and the emergence of such film directing auteurs as [[Gillian Armstrong]], [[Phillip Noyce]] and [[Bruce Beresford]].\n\nA major theme of Australian cinema which matured in the 1970s was one of survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A&nbsp;number of thrillers and horror films dubbed \"outback gothic\" have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'', ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' in the 1980s and ''[[Japanese Story]]'', ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' and ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' in the 2000s. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max series]]. 1971's ''Walkabout'' was a British film set in Australia which was a forerunner to many Australian films related to Indigenous themes and introduced [[David Gulpilil]] to cinematic audiences. 1976's ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' directed by [[Fred Schepisi]] was an award-winning historical drama from a book by [[Thomas Keneally]] about the tragic story of an Aboriginal [[bushranger]].\n\nClassic stories from [[Australian literature]] and [[Australian history]] continued to be popular subjects for cinematic adaptation during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979) featured [[Judy Davis]] and [[Sam Neill]] in early lead roles. 1982's ''[[We of the Never Never]]'' followed up on the theme of the female experience of life in the [[Australian bush]]. 1982's ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' starring [[Tom Burlinson]] and [[Sigrid Thornton]] dramatised the classic [[Banjo Paterson]] poem of that name and became one of the all time box-office successes of Australian cinema. In addition to the serious historical dramas popular in the 1970s, a number of films celebrating and satirizing Australian colloquial culture were produced over the decade, including: ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'' (1972), ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973), and ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'' (1974). The Barry McKenzie films saw performing-artist and writer [[Barry Humphries]] collaborating with director [[Bruce Beresford]]. In 1976, [[Peter Finch]] was awarded a posthumous [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in the American satire ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'', becoming the first Australian to win an Oscar for best actor.<ref>http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/australian_productions/F_A_Success/Academy_42_89.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226195718/http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/australian_productions/F_A_Success/Academy_42_89.asp |date=26 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n1980's ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Edward Woodward]] dramatised the controversial trial of an Australian soldier during the [[Boer War]] and was followed by 1981's [[World War&nbsp;I]] drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' directed by [[Peter Weir]] and starring [[Mel Gibson]]. These films, now considered classics of Australian cinema explored contemporary Australian identity through dramatic episodes in Australian history. Gibson went on to further success in 1982's ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' before transferring to pursue his Hollywood career as an actor and director. Many other Australian stars would follow his path to international stardom in the coming decades. ''The Year of Living Dangerously'' was directed by Peter Weir, who also made a successful transition to Hollywood. Weir contributed to the screenplay along with its original author Christopher Koch, and playwright [[David Williamson]]. Williamson rose to prominence in the early 1970s, and has gone on to write several other original scripts and screenplays made into successful Australian films including: ''[[Don's Party]]'' (1976); ''Gallipoli'' (1981), ''[[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'' (2009).<ref>[[IMDbName:0932011|David Williamson \u2013 IMDb]]</ref>\n\nActor/comedian [[Paul Hogan]] wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role in his first film, ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986), about a down-to-earth hunter who travelled from the Australian Outback to New York City. The movie became the most successful Australian film ever, and launched Hogan's international film career. Following the success of \"Crocodile\" Dundee Hogan starred in the sequel, ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' in 1988. 1988 also saw the release of the drama ''[[Evil Angels (film)|Evil Angels]]'' (released outside of Australia and New Zealand as ''A Cry in the Dark'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094924/releaseinfo#akas|title=A Cry in the Dark (1988) \u2013 Release dates |publisher= IMDb.com|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> about the [[Lindy Chamberlain]] saga, in which a baby was taken by a [[dingo]] at [[Ayers Rock]] and her mother was accused of having murdered the child.\n\n[[Nicole Kidman]] began appearing in Australian children's TV and film in the early 1980s \u2013 including starring roles in ''[[BMX Bandits (film)|BMX Bandits]]'' and ''[[Bush Christmas]]''. During the 1980s, she appeared in several Australian productions, including ''[[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Bangkok Hilton]]'' (1989), and in 1989, Kidman starred in ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' alongside [[Sam Neill]] and [[Billy Zane]]. The thriller garnered strong reviews and Hollywood roles followed.<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790280.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 Dead Calm]. Variety.com. 1 January 2007.

Low budget films such as the comedy/drama ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'', starring [[Toni Collette]],<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/muriels-wedding/ ''Muriel's Wedding'' (1994) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> the gently satirical suburban comedy ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' directed by [[Rob Sitch]] (which cast [[Eric Bana]] in his first prominent film role), and [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s flamboyant ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]''<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/strictly-ballroom/ Strictly Ballroom (1992) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> each attained commercial and critical success, and explored quirky characters inhabiting contemporary Australian suburbia \u2013 marking something of a departure from the [[Outback]] and historical sagas which obtained success in the 1970s and 1980s. [[Stephan Elliott]]'s 1994 film ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' mixed traditional outback cinematography and landscape with contemporary urban sub-culture: following three [[drag queen]]s on a road trip to Central Australia.\n\nWhile a number of major international stars gained early prominence in Australia over the period, an important stable of established and emerging local stars with prodigious film credits remained prominent, including screen veterans [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Bryan Brown]] and [[Chris Haywood]].\n\nThe World War II drama ''[[Blood Oath (film)|Blood Oath]]'' (1990) debuted both [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Jason Donovan]], in minor cinematic roles. Crowe demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this early period of his career by starring soon after as a street gang Melbourne [[skinhead]] in 1992's ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' and then as an inner-Sydney working class gay man in 1994's ''[[The Sum of Us (film)|The Sum of Us]]'' before transferring to the US to commence his Hollywood career.\n\nGeorge Miller's ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995) employed new digital effects to make a barnyard come alive and went on to become one of Australia's highest-grossing films. The 1996 drama ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'' achieved an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] award for [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Gregor Jordan]]'s 1999 film ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' gave [[Heath Ledger]] his first leading role. After Ledger's successful transition to Hollywood, Jordan and Ledger collaborated again in 2003 with Ledger playing the iconic [[bushranger]] title role in the film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', which co-starred British actress [[Naomi Watts]].\n\nThe canon of films related to [[Indigenous Australians]] also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century, with [[Nick Parsons]]' 1996 film ''[[Dead Heart (film)|Dead Heart]]'' featuring [[Ernie Dingo]] and [[Bryan Brown]];<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/dead-heart/ Dead Heart (1996) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[The Tracker (2002 film)|The Tracker]]'', starring [[Gary Sweet]] and [[David Gulpilil]];<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/tracker/ The Tracker (2002) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]''<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/rabbit-proof-fence/ Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> in 2002. In 2006, Rolf de Heer's ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' became the first major feature film to be shot in an Indigenous language and the film was recognised at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe shifting demographics of Australia following post-war multicultural immigration was reflected in Australian cinema through the period and in successful films like 1993's [[The Heartbreak Kid (1993 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]; 1999's [[Looking for Alibrandi (film)|Looking for Alibrandi]]; 2003's [[Fat Pizza]]; the [[Wog Boy]] comedies and 2007's [[Romulus, My Father (film)|Romulus, My Father]] which all dealt with aspects of the migrant experience or Australian subcultures.<ref>[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|date=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Rob Sitch]] and [[Working Dog Productions]] followed the success of ''The Castle'' with period comedy ''[[The Dish]]'', which was the highest grossing Australian film of the Year 2000 and entered the top ten list of highest grossing Australian films. Big budget Australian-international co-productions ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' ([[Baz Luhrmann]], 2001) and [[Happy Feet]] (which won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] for filmmaker [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] in 2006) also entered the top ten list during the first decade of the new century. Baz Luhrmann directed a series of international hits and returned to Australia for the production of 2008's ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', which showcased a host of Australian stars including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[David Wenham]] and went on to become the second highest-grossing film in Australian cinematic history.\n\n''[[Lantana (film)|Lantana]]'', directed by [[Ray Lawrence (film director)|Ray Lawrence]] attained critical and commercial success in 2001 for its examination of a complex series of relationships in suburban Sydney, and events surrounding a mysterious crime. It won seven [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Awards]] including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for [[Anthony LaPaglia]] and Best Actress for [[Kerry Armstrong]].\n\nEmerging star [[Sam Worthington]] had early lead roles in the 2002 mobster black comedy ''[[Dirty Deeds (2002 film)|Dirty Deeds]]'' and 2003's crime caper ''[[Gettin' Square]]''. ''Gettin Square'' also featured rising star [[David Wenham]] who demonstrated versatility with a string of critically acclaimed roles including the title role in [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]]'s 1999 biopic ''[[Molokai: The Story of Father Damien]]'' and the 2001 thriller ''[[The Bank (2001 film)|The Bank]]'', directed by the politically conscious film director [[Robert Connolly]].\n\nIn 2005, ''[[Little Fish (2005 film)|Little Fish]]'' marked a return to Australian film for actress [[Cate Blanchett]] and won five [[Australian Film Institute Awards]] including Best Actor for [[Hugo Weaving]], Best Actress for Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress for screen veteran [[Noni Hazlehurst]].\n\nIn 2008, the documentary film celebrating the romps of the [[Australian New Wave]] of 1970s and 1980s low-budget cinema: ''[[Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!]]'' The film was directed by Mark Hartley and interviews filmmakers including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Dennis Hopper]], George Miller and [[Barry Humphries]].\n\nThe early 2000s were generally not successful years for Australian cinema, with several confronting dramas proving unpopular at the box office. In 2008, no Australian movies made $3 million at the box office, but a conscious decision by filmmakers to broaden the types of films being made as well as the range of budgets produced a series of box-office hits at the close of the decade. Strong box office performances were recorded in 2009\u201310 by [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mao's Last Dancer (film)|Mao's Last Dancer]]''; the Aboriginal musical ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'' the dramatization of [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]]'s novel ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)|Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''; and the crime drama ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]'' which featured major Australian screen stars [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Jacki Weaver]]. ''Animal Kingdom'' achieved success at the 2010 [[Australian Film Institute Awards]] and was acclaimed at film festivals around the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/good-year-for-australian-films-as-they-switch-bleak-for-broad-20101210-18sss.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Garry | last=Maddox | title=Good year for Australian films as they switch bleak for broad | date=11 December 2010}}</ref> ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' became the highest-grossing domestic film of 2010 and it was nominated for nine Australian Film Institute Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watchoutfor.com.au/tomorrow-when-the-war-began-biggest-film-of-2010-movie-news|title=Tomorrow When The War Began Biggest Film Of 2010|first=Sean|last=Lynch|work=watchoutfor.com.au|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723234954/http://watchoutfor.com.au/tomorrow-when-the-war-began-biggest-film-of-2010-movie-news/|archive-date=23 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=11828&Section=AFI_Award_Winners_and_Nominees |title=The Australian Film Institute &#124; AFI Award Winners and Nominees Ceremony |publisher=Afi.org.au |accessdate=19 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216034823/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=11828&Section=AFI_Award_Winners_and_Nominees |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nOther award-winning films of the period included ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'' (2009) starring [[Anthony LaPaglia]]; Middle Eastern crime flick ''[[Cedar Boys]]'' (2009) directed by Serhat Caradee; and animated comedy drama ''[[Mary and Max]]''.\n===2010\u2013present===\nWorld War I drama ''[[Beneath Hill 60]]'' (2010), directed by [[Jeremy Sims]] and starring [[Brendan Cowell]] was nominated for numerous awards, and won three.\n\nContemporary Indigenous film-makers include [[Warwick Thornton]], [[Wayne Blair]], [[Trisha Morton-Thomas]] and [[Rachel Perkins]].\n\n==The industry in the 21st century==\n[[File:Olympic park sydney AIRSCREEN.jpg|thumb|Open-Air-Cinema in [[Sydney]]]]\nThe Australian film industry continues to produce a reasonable number of films each year, but in common with other English-speaking countries, Australia has often found it difficult to compete with the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2013/jul/18/australian-film-bigger-audiences|title=Why don't we watch more Australian films?|last=Swift|first=Brendan|date=2013-07-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> the latter helped by having a much larger home market.

In 2008 the three agencies were consolidated into [[Screen Australia]].\n\nThere is an ongoing debate of the need and role of government support for the Australian film industry. Some argue in favour of government support as being the only way that the local film industry can compete against the hegemony of Hollywood. The argument against government support is that the industry is viable without support and will become stronger if increasingly globalised market forces are allowed full and untrammeled play. Others argue that a film industry in itself has little value. The history of the industry in Australia is to some extent a result of the ascendancy of one position over the other.\n\n==Highest-grossing Australian films==\n{{main|List of highest-grossing films in Australia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+10 highest-grossing Australian films at the Australia box office<ref>http://www.mpdaa.org.au/customers/mpdaa/mpdaa.nsf/HistoricalBoxOffice?ReadForm</ref>\n|-\n!

ever made. Since then, Australian crews have produced many films, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers started their careers in Australian films, many of whom have acquired international reputations, and a number of whom have found greater financial benefits in careers in larger film-producing centres, such as in the United States.\n\nThe first public screenings of films in Australia took place in October 1896, within a year of the world's first screening in Paris by [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The first Australian exhibition took place at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Hall]] in [[Collins Street, Melbourne]], to provide alternative entertainment for the dance-hall patrons. Commercially successful Australian films have included: ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', and [[Chris Noonan]]'s [[Babe (film) | ''Babe'']]. Other award-winning productions include [[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)| ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'']], [[Gallipoli (1981 film)| ''Gallipoli'']], [[The Tracker (2002 film)| ''The Tracker'']], [[Shine (film)| ''Shine'']] and ''[[Ten Canoes]]''.\n\nAustralian actors of renown include [[Errol Flynn]], [[Peter Finch]], [[Rod Taylor]], [[Paul Hogan]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Bryan Brown]], [[Judy Davis]], [[Jacki Weaver]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Anthony LaPaglia]], [[David Wenham]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Sam Worthington]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Sarah Snook]], [[Mia Wasikowska]] and [[Margot Robbie]].\n\nCinema in Australia is subject to [[censorship in Australia|censorship]], called classification, though films may be refused classification, resulting in them being effectively banned.\n\n==History==\nThe Australian film history has been characterized as one of 'boom and bust' due to the unstable and cyclical nature of its industry; there have been deep troughs when few films were made for decades and high peaks when a glut of films reached the market.<ref>David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Sydney: Pan Macmillan, 1990</ref>\n\n===Pioneer days \u2013 1890s\u20131910===\nThe [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athanaeum Hall]] in Collins Street, [[Melbourne]], was a dance hall from the 1880s, which from time to time would provide alternative entertainment to patrons. In October 1896, it exhibited the first [[movie film]] shown in Australia, within a year of the first public screening of a film in Paris on 28 December 1895 by the French [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]. The Athanaeum would continue screenings, but these early screenings were all short films.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSome of the earliest movie film shot in Australia consisted of films of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] dancers in [[Central Australia]], shot by anthropologists [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] and [[F.J. Gillen]] between 1900 and 1903. They pioneered [[sound recording]] on [[wax cylinder]]s and shot their films under very difficult conditions.<ref>{{cite dictionary| title = Spencer, Sir Walter Baldwin (1860\u20131929) | dictionary = Australian Dictionary of Biography|via=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University | url = http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120043b.htm | date = 14 July 1929 |accessdate=8 January 2020|quote=First published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, (MUP), 1990|first=D.J.|last=Mulvaney }}</ref>\n\nhe earliest [[feature length]], [[narrative film]] in the world was the Australian-produced ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), shown at the Athenaeum. The film was written and directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]] and included several of his family. The film was also exhibited in the United Kingdom, and was commercially very successful.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nMelbourne was also home of one of the world's first film studios, the [[Limelight Department]], operated by [[The Salvation Army]] between 1897 and 1910.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/limelight/docs/lime/default.htm |title=Information at ABS website |access-date=7 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903014817/http://www.abc.net.au/limelight/docs/lime/default.htm |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Limelight Department produced evangelical material for use by the Salvation Army, as well as private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it the largest film producer of its time. The major innovation of the Limelight Department came in 1899 when [[Herbert Booth]] and [[Joseph Perry (cinematographer)|Joseph Perry]] began work on ''Soldiers of the Cross'', described by some as the first feature-length film ever produced.

It began slowly in the 1900s, and 1910 saw 4 narrative films released, then 51 in 1911, 30 in 1912, and 17 in 1913, and back to 4 in 1914, when the beginning of World War I brought an end to film making.<ref>Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900\u20131977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 1 \u2013 49</ref> While these numbers may seem small, Australia was one of the most prolific film-producing countries at the time. In all, between 1906 and 1928, 150 narrative feature films were made, of which almost 90 were made between 1910 and 1912.<ref>Albert Moran & Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 32</ref>\n\nThere was a general consolidation in the early 1910s in the production, distribution and exhibition of films in Australia which saw by 1912 the merger of numerous independent producers into [[Greater Union|Australasian Films and Union Theaters]] (now known as [[Event Cinemas]]) which established control over film distributors and cinemas and required smaller producers to deal with the cartel. Some view the arrangement as opening the way for American distributors in the 1920s to sign exclusive deals with Australian cinemas to exhibit only their products, thereby shutting out the local product and crippling the local film industry.<ref>''Australian screen'', http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/picture-show-man/clip1/</ref>\n\nThere are various other explanations for the decline of the industry in the 1920s. Some historians point to falling audience numbers, a lack of interest in Australian product and narratives, and Australia's participation in the war. Also, there was an [[Bushranger ban|official ban on bushranger films]] in 1912.<ref>Reade, Eric (1970) ''Australian Silent Films: A Pictorial History of Silent Films from 1896 to 1926''.

The banning of bushranger films in NSW is fictionalised in [[Kathryn Heyman]]'s 2006 novel, ''Captain Starlight's Apprentice''.</ref> With the suspension of local film production, Australian cinema chains sought alternative products in the United States and realised that Australian-produced films were much more expensive than the imported product, which were priced cheaply as production expenses had already been recouped in the home market. To redress this imbalance, the federal government imposed a tax on imported film in 1914, but this was removed by 1918.\n\nWhatever the explanation, by 1923, American films dominated the Australian market with 94% of all exhibited films coming from that country.<ref>Albert Moran & Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 30</ref>\n\n===1930s\u20131960s===\n[[File:Buladelah.jpg|thumb|left|The old Pacific Cinema at [[Bulahdelah, New South Wales]], a classic example of an early small country town cinema.]]\n\nIn 1930, [[F. W. Thring]] (1883\u20131936) established the [[Efftee Studios]] based in [[Melbourne]] to make talking films using optical sound equipment imported from the USA. The first sound films produced were in 1931, when the company produced ''[[Diggers (1931 film)|Diggers]]'' (1931), ''[[A Co-respondent's Course]]'' (1931), ''[[The Haunted Barn]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Sentimental Bloke (1932 film)|The Sentimental Bloke]]'' (1932).

Rafferty's onscreen image as a lanky, laconic bushman struck a chord with filmgoers and he appeared in iconic early Australian films such as ''[[Forty Thousand Horsemen]]'', ''[[The Rats of Tobruk (1944 film)|The Rats of Tobruk]]'', ''[[The Overlanders (film)|The Overlanders]]'' and ''[[Eureka Stockade (1949 film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (''Overlanders'' and ''Eureka'' were part of a series of Australian themed films produced by Britain's iconic [[Ealing Studios]]).

Similarly, Peter Finch starred in quintessentially Australian roles (such as ''Digger'' or stockman) through a series of popular films and had a successful and diverse screen career in Britain and the United States.\n\nBoth [[Ron Randell]] and [[Rod Taylor]] began their acting careers in Australia initially in radio and on stage before appearing in such Australian films as ''[[Smithy (1946 film)|Smithy]]'' (1946) for the former and ''[[Long John Silver (film)|Long John Silver]]'' (1954) for the latter before transferring to the United States to become Hollywood leading men in a number of films of the late 1940s (Randell) and both from the 1950s onwards' Taylor had with starring roles in ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) as well as several American TV series such as ''[[Hong Kong (TV series)|Hong Kong]]''.\n\nSeveral notable films based on stories from [[Australian literature]] (generally with strong rural themes) were made in Australia in the 1950s \u2013 but by British and American production companies, including ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' (1956) which starred [[Virginia McKenna]] and Peter Finch; ''[[The Shiralee (1957 film)|The Shiralee]]'' (1957) also starring Peter Finch with Australian actors [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Kerr]] and [[Ed Devereaux]] in supporting roles; ''[[Robbery Under Arms (1957 film)|Robbery Under Arms]]'', again starring Finch in 1957; and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1959), starring [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[John Mills]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]; and in 1960, ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' was shot partly in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of [[New South Wales]] with foreign leads [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] but a supporting cast including Australians Chips Rafferty, [[John Meillon]] and [[Leonard Teale]].\n\nIn 1958, the [[Australian Film Institute]] was formed and in the same year began awarding the [[Australian Film Institute Awards]].\n\nAustralian film production was reaching a low ebb with few notable productions during the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&Section=Past_Winners |title=The Australian Film Institute &#124; Past Winners |access-date=29 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723062132/http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&Section=Past_Winners |archive-date=23 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The 1966 comedy ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'', starring [[Walter Chiari]], [[Chips Rafferty]] and [[Claire Dunne]] was a rare hit of the period which also documented something of the changing face of Australian society: telling the story of a newly arrived Italian immigrant who, working as a labourer in Sydney, becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with [[Australian slang]] and culture. The film foreshadowed the successful approaching \"[[Australian New Wave|New Wave]]\" of Australian cinema of the 1970s that would often showcase colloquial Australian culture.\n\nThere continued to be an appeal for Australian actors in Hollywood as \"action-men\", with the casting of Australian [[George Lazenby]] to replace [[Sean Connery]] portraying the superspy [[James Bond]] in the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\n===Film renaissance \u2013 1970s and 1980s===\n[[File:JohnGorton1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] initiated several avenues of government support for Australian cinema.]]\n\n[[John Gorton]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1968\u20131971, initiated several forms of government support for film and the arts. The [[Gough Whitlam]] government (1972\u201375) continued to support Australian film and state governments also established assistance programs. These measures led to the resurgence of Australian film called the [[Australian New Wave]], which lasted until the mid-late [[Australian films of the 1980s|1980s]]. The era also marked the emergence of the \"[[Ozploitation]]\" style \u2013 characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.\n\nFilms such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' ([[Peter Weir]], 1975) and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' ([[Ken Hannam]], 1975) made an impact on the international arena. The 1970s and '80s are regarded by many as a 'golden age' of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the dark dystopian fiction of ''[[Mad Max]]'' ([[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], 1979) to the romantic comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' ([[Peter Faiman]], 1986) and the emergence of such film directing auteurs as [[Gillian Armstrong]], [[Phillip Noyce]] and [[Bruce Beresford]].\n\nA major theme of Australian cinema which matured in the 1970s was one of survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A&nbsp;number of thrillers and horror films dubbed \"outback gothic\" have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'', ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' in the 1980s and ''[[Japanese Story]]'', ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' and ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' in the 2000s. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max series]]. 1971's ''Walkabout'' was a British film set in Australia which was a forerunner to many Australian films related to Indigenous themes and introduced [[David Gulpilil]] to cinematic audiences. 1976's ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' directed by [[Fred Schepisi]] was an award-winning historical drama from a book by [[Thomas Keneally]] about the tragic story of an Aboriginal [[bushranger]].\n\nClassic stories from [[Australian literature]] and [[Australian history]] continued to be popular subjects for cinematic adaptation during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979) featured [[Judy Davis]] and [[Sam Neill]] in early lead roles. 1982's ''[[We of the Never Never]]'' followed up on the theme of the female experience of life in the [[Australian bush]]. 1982's ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' starring [[Tom Burlinson]] and [[Sigrid Thornton]] dramatised the classic [[Banjo Paterson]] poem of that name and became one of the all time box-office successes of Australian cinema. In addition to the serious historical dramas popular in the 1970s, a number of films celebrating and satirizing Australian colloquial culture were produced over the decade, including: ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'' (1972), ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973), and ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'' (1974). The Barry McKenzie films saw performing-artist and writer [[Barry Humphries]] collaborating with director [[Bruce Beresford]]. In 1976, [[Peter Finch]] was awarded a posthumous [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in the American satire ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'', becoming the first Australian to win an Oscar for best actor.<ref>http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/australian_productions/F_A_Success/Academy_42_89.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226195718/http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/australian_productions/F_A_Success/Academy_42_89.asp |date=26 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n1980's ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Edward Woodward]] dramatised the controversial trial of an Australian soldier during the [[Boer War]] and was followed by 1981's [[World War&nbsp;I]] drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' directed by [[Peter Weir]] and starring [[Mel Gibson]]. These films, now considered classics of Australian cinema explored contemporary Australian identity through dramatic episodes in Australian history. Gibson went on to further success in 1982's ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' before transferring to pursue his Hollywood career as an actor and director. Many other Australian stars would follow his path to international stardom in the coming decades. ''The Year of Living Dangerously'' was directed by Peter Weir, who also made a successful transition to Hollywood. Weir contributed to the screenplay along with its original author Christopher Koch, and playwright [[David Williamson]]. Williamson rose to prominence in the early 1970s, and has gone on to write several other original scripts and screenplays made into successful Australian films including: ''[[Don's Party]]'' (1976); ''Gallipoli'' (1981), ''[[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'' (2009).<ref>[[IMDbName:0932011|David Williamson \u2013 IMDb]]</ref>\n\nActor/comedian [[Paul Hogan]] wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role in his first film, ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986), about a down-to-earth hunter who travelled from the Australian Outback to New York City.

[[Stephan Elliott]]'s 1994 film ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' mixed traditional outback cinematography and landscape with contemporary urban sub-culture: following three [[drag queen]]s on a road trip to Central Australia.\n\nWhile a number of major international stars gained early prominence in Australia over the period, an important stable of established and emerging local stars with prodigious film credits remained prominent, including screen veterans [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Bryan Brown]] and [[Chris Haywood]].\n\nThe World War II drama ''[[Blood Oath (film)|Blood Oath]]'' (1990) debuted both [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Jason Donovan]], in minor cinematic roles. Crowe demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this early period of his career by starring soon after as a street gang Melbourne [[skinhead]] in 1992's ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' and then as an inner-Sydney working class gay man in 1994's ''[[The Sum of Us (film)|The Sum of Us]]'' before transferring to the US to commence his Hollywood career.\n\nGeorge Miller's ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995) employed new digital effects to make a barnyard come alive and went on to become one of Australia's highest-grossing films. The 1996 drama ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'' achieved an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] award for [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Gregor Jordan]]'s 1999 film ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' gave [[Heath Ledger]] his first leading role. After Ledger's successful transition to Hollywood, Jordan and Ledger collaborated again in 2003 with Ledger playing the iconic [[bushranger]] title role in the film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', which co-starred British actress [[Naomi Watts]].\n\nThe canon of films related to [[Indigenous Australians]] also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century, with [[Nick Parsons]]' 1996 film ''[[Dead Heart (film)|Dead Heart]]'' featuring [[Ernie Dingo]] and [[Bryan Brown]];<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/dead-heart/ Dead Heart (1996) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[The Tracker (2002 film)|The Tracker]]'', starring [[Gary Sweet]] and [[David Gulpilil]];<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/tracker/ The Tracker (2002) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]''<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/rabbit-proof-fence/ Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online]</ref> in 2002.

Baz Luhrmann directed a series of international hits and returned to Australia for the production of 2008's ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', which showcased a host of Australian stars including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[David Wenham]] and went on to become the second highest-grossing film in Australian cinematic history.\n\n''[[Lantana (film)|Lantana]]'', directed by [[Ray Lawrence (film director)|Ray Lawrence]] attained critical and commercial success in 2001 for its examination of a complex series of relationships in suburban Sydney, and events surrounding a mysterious crime.

In 2008, no Australian movies made $3 million at the box office, but a conscious decision by filmmakers to broaden the types of films being made as well as the range of budgets produced a series of box-office hits at the close of the decade. Strong box office performances were recorded in 2009\u201310 by [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mao's Last Dancer (film)|Mao's Last Dancer]]''; the Aboriginal musical ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'' the dramatization of [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]]'s novel ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)|Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''; and the crime drama ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]'' which featured major Australian screen stars [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Jacki Weaver]].

The [[South Australian Film Corporation]] was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the [[Australian Film Commission]] was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films.\n\nThe Federal Australian government had supported the Australian film industry through the funding and development agencies of [[Film Finance Corporation Australia]], the [[Australian Film Commission]] and [[Film Australia]]. In 2008 the three agencies were consolidated into [[Screen Australia]].\n\nThere is an ongoing debate of the need and role of government support for the Australian film industry. Some argue in favour of government support as being the only way that the local film industry can compete against the hegemony of Hollywood. The argument against government support is that the industry is viable without support and will become stronger if increasingly globalised market forces are allowed full and untrammeled play. Others argue that a film industry in itself has little value. The history of the industry in Australia is to some extent a result of the ascendancy of one position over the other.\n\n==Highest-grossing Australian films==\n{{main|List of highest-grossing films in Australia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+10 highest-grossing Australian films at the Australia box office<ref>http://www.mpdaa.org.au/customers/mpdaa/mpdaa.nsf/HistoricalBoxOffice?ReadForm</ref>\n|-\n!
