It was here the term '''''gradsect''''' was coined that coupled purposive, transect sampling with a hierarchical framework of environmental gradients considered to be key determinants of species distribution.\n\n== Methodology ==\nIn constructing a gradsect, existing information is initially reviewed in which a hierarchy of environmental gradients is first identified either by visual means (maps, aerial photographs etc..) or through [[numerical analysis]] or [[spatial analysis]] of institutional or other data sources. A typical regional gradsect for example may be constructed according to a '''primary climate gradient''' (temperature, moisture, seasonality) then a '''secondary gradient''' ([[geomorphology]], [[lithology]], major and minor drainage systems), a '''tertiary gradient''' possibly represented by a local soil [[catena (soil)|catena]] or local land use farming system or finer scale gradient levels representing local vegetational sequences. Through an inspection of spatial overlays of all gradients, a minimum number of sample locations is then purposively located to reflect, as far as possible, total environmental variation. For logistic and other purposes (such as improving the capacity to locate rare species) the steepest gradients are usually selected. In this way an ''ideal'' gradsect is constructed that may then be modified to accommodate logistic tradeoffs. The selection discipline requires that the fullest possible range of each hierarchical level is sampled. This commonly results in a set of progressively nested clusters of sample sites contained within the overarching primary gradient that may not reflect a linear distribution. At relatively local landscape scale, a primary gradients may be represented by salinity levels or water depth as in tidal wetlands or micro-topographic relief as in forest margins or a [[riparian zone]]. For most practical purposes, transects are commonly laid out along contours perpendicular to the main direction of the gradient. Iterative spatial analysis of environmental layers over a [[digital elevation model]] can then be used to identify areas requiring additional sampling thereby improving environmental representativeness.<ref>Gillison, A.N. (2013). Plant Functional Types and Traits at the Community, Ecosystem and World Level, in ''Vegetation Ecology'', Second Edition (eds E. van der Maarel and J. Franklin), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Oxford, UK. Ch 12, pp.347-386.</ref>\n\n== Advantages and limitations ==\nInitial studies in gradsect development revealed considerable logistic and other advantages over more traditional non-gradient-based survey designs concerned primarily with random sampling. This finding is now widely supported especially in [[biodiversity]] and other areas of [[environmental surveying]] and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] design (see Applications next). Apart from improved logistic efficiency, the gradsect method seeks to maximise environmental representativeness which has the dual advantage of potentially improving location of rarities and enhancing spatial modelling of species distribution. Because the underlying statistical model is not based on [[probability theory]], gradsect sampling cannot be used to estimate numbers of species or other biological attributes per unit area. For that purpose some measure of random sampling needs to be built into the sample design.\n\n== Applications ==\nSince the publication of gradsect theory in 1984, subsequent vegetational and landscape studies in regional Australia (Austin and Heyligers 1989);<ref>Austin, M.P. and Heyligers, P.C. (1989). Vegetation survey design for conservation: gradsect sampling of forests in northeastern\nNew South Wales; ''Biological Conservation'' 50: 13\u201332.</ref> Ludwig and Tongway (1995<ref>Ludwig, J.A. and Tongway, D.J. (1995). Spatial organization of landscapes and its function in semi-arid woodlands, Australia.

(1998). An evaluation of the gradsect biological survey method. ''Biodiversity and Conservation''. 7: 1093\u20131121.</ref>).

At relatively local landscape scale, a primary gradients may be represented by salinity levels or water depth as in tidal wetlands or micro-topographic relief as in forest margins or a [[riparian zone]]. For most practical purposes, transects are commonly laid out along contours perpendicular to the main direction of the gradient. Iterative spatial analysis of environmental layers over a [[digital elevation model]] can then be used to identify areas requiring additional sampling thereby improving environmental representativeness.<ref>Gillison, A.N. (2013). Plant Functional Types and Traits at the Community, Ecosystem and World Level, in ''Vegetation Ecology'', Second Edition (eds E. van der Maarel and J. Franklin), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Oxford, UK. Ch 12, pp.347-386.</ref>\n\n== Advantages and limitations ==\nInitial studies in gradsect development revealed considerable logistic and other advantages over more traditional non-gradient-based survey designs concerned primarily with random sampling. This finding is now widely supported especially in [[biodiversity]] and other areas of [[environmental surveying]] and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] design (see Applications next). Apart from improved logistic efficiency, the gradsect method seeks to maximise environmental representativeness which has the dual advantage of potentially improving location of rarities and enhancing spatial modelling of species distribution. Because the underlying statistical model is not based on [[probability theory]], gradsect sampling cannot be used to estimate numbers of species or other biological attributes per unit area. For that purpose some measure of random sampling needs to be built into the sample design.\n\n== Applications ==\nSince the publication of gradsect theory in 1984, subsequent vegetational and landscape studies in regional Australia (Austin and Heyligers 1989);<ref>Austin, M.P. and Heyligers, P.C. (1989). Vegetation survey design for conservation: gradsect sampling of forests in northeastern\nNew South Wales; ''Biological Conservation'' 50: 13\u201332.</ref> Ludwig and Tongway (1995<ref>Ludwig, J.A. and Tongway, D.J. (1995). Spatial organization of landscapes and its function in semi-arid woodlands, Australia. ''Landscape Ecology''. 10: 51\u201363.</ref>) were followed by a successful evaluation of the method in faunal surveys in South Africa (Wessels et al.<ref>Wessels, K.J., Van Jaarsveld, A.S., Grimbeek, J.D. & Van der Linde, M.J. (1998). An evaluation of the gradsect biological survey method. ''Biodiversity and Conservation''. 7: 1093\u20131121.</ref>). Since then applications involving gradsects have ranged from habitat suitability studies of fungi (Shearer and Crane 2011<ref>Shearer, B.L. and Crane, C.E. (2011). Habitat suitability of soils from a topographic gradient across the Fitzgerald River National Park for invasion by ''Phytophthora cinnamomi''.

(2009). ''Report on a second habitat assessment for the Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus) within the island of Java''. International Rhino Foundation.</ref>). Vegetation studies using gradsects have been widely applied in many countries ranging from tidal wetlands (Parker et al. 2011<ref>Parker, V.T., L. M. Schile, M.C. Vasey, and J.C. Callaway. (2011).

{"title_page": "\u00d6sterreichische Alpenfahrt", "text_new": "The '''\u00d6sterreichische Alpenfahrt''' (also known as the '''Austrian Alpine Rally''' or the '''Rally of [[Austria]]''') was a [[rallying|rally]] that was part of the inaugural [[World Rally Championship]] in [[1973 World Rally Championship season|1973]].\n\n== History ==\nModelled on the German [[Prinz-Heinrich-Fahrt]], the Alpenfahrt was first run in 1910, making it older than the [[Rally Monte Carlo]]. The route across the [[Alps]] was considered as one of the hardest rallies in Europe before [[World War I]]. The cars at this time were unreliable and mountain roads were sometimes no more than steep insecure paths.  Nevertheless, between 1912 and 1914 [[Audi Type C]]s (''Alpensieger'') proved reliable and rapid enough to win the rally in three successive years.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 41</ref> In 1911, [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Austro-Daimler]] were awarded the team prize.\n\nThe last rally for more than three decades took place in 1914. After the First World War, [[Austrian First Republic|Austria]] couldn't finance the event alone, but with the participation of several automobile associations an ''Internationale Alpenfahrt'' rally could again be held from 1928 to 1936. The rally ran through Austria, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]].

The route across the [[Alps]] was considered as one of the hardest rallies in Europe before [[World War I]]. The cars at this time were unreliable and mountain roads were sometimes no more than steep insecure paths.  Nevertheless, between 1912 and 1914 [[Audi Type C]]s (''Alpensieger'') proved reliable and rapid enough to win the rally in three successive years.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 41</ref> In 1911, [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Austro-Daimler]] were awarded the team prize.\n\nThe last rally for more than three decades took place in 1914. After the First World War, [[Austrian First Republic|Austria]] couldn't finance the event alone, but with the participation of several automobile associations an ''Internationale Alpenfahrt'' rally could again be held from 1928 to 1936. The rally ran through Austria, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]].
