In Greater London, it operated all National Rail services (other than London Overground) in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the London Boroughs of Richmond-upon-Thames and Hounslow, and also served the London Boroughs of Merton, Wandsworth and Lambeth.\n\nMost SWT services ran on electrified lines using the 750&nbsp;[[volts|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[third-rail]] system. There is a diesel fleet for services on the West of England line to Salisbury, Exeter and Bristol, using the unelectrified track beyond [[Worting Junction]] just west of Basingstoke, and for Salisbury to Southampton via Romsey services which also served Eastleigh. SWT operated almost 1,700 train services per day.\n\nFrom [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]], SWT's London terminus, long-distance trains ran to southern England, including the major coastal population centres of Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth. There were also trains to Reading, Exeter and Bristol, but these are not the principal fast services from London to those cities, which are operated from {{stnlink|London Paddington}} by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]]. The majority of its passengers were on suburban commuter lines in inner and south-west London, Surrey, east Berkshire, and north-east Hampshire.\n\nSince privatisation in 1996, the network changed considerably. It no longer served [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]], [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]], 'Coastway' stations between [[Chichester railway station|Chichester]] and [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], or the [[Reading\u2013Basingstoke line|Reading to Basingstoke line]]. Services to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] (introduced in 2004 to replace withdrawn [[Arriva Trains Wales]] services), [[Mottisfont & Dunbridge railway station|Mottisfont and Dunbridge]] and [[Dean railway station|Dean]] were introduced after the start of the franchise. Its longstanding services beyond [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter]] to [[Paignton railway station|Paignton]], [[Plymouth railway station|Plymouth]] and [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]], which ran in competition with [[First Great Western]] and its predecessors, ceased in December 2009 so as to release stock for the hourly Waterloo to Exeter service.<ref>{{cite news |work=Rail |location =Peterborough |issue= 595 |date=2 July 2008|title=SWT Exeter \u2013 Paignton / Plymouth will stop in December 2009. |page =20}}</ref>\n\nAs with most rail companies, non-folding bicycles were banned from peak-time trains to and from London.

Quiet Zones are available on most outer-suburban services and on some express services and are indicated by notices in the windows and signs on the doors. Passengers in these zones are requested not to use mobile phones to take calls or play music out loud.\n\n===Routes===\nSouth West Trains operated suburban and long-distance trains.

Taken in order westwards from Waterloo, travelling down the SWML, they are:\n* [[Waterloo to Reading line]]: from [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]\n** The [[Hounslow Loop Line]] from Barnes to [[Whitton railway station|Whitton]] or [[Feltham railway station|Feltham]]\n** The [[Windsor & Eton Riverside railway station|Windsor]] branch from [[Staines railway station|Staines-upon-Thames]]\n** The [[Chertsey railway station|Chertsey]] loop line from [[Virginia Water railway station|Virginia Water]] to [[Weybridge railway station|Weybridge]]\n** The Ascot to [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford]] line via [[Aldershot railway station|Aldershot]]\n*  The [[Sutton & Mole Valley Line|Mole Valley Line]], from [[Raynes Park railway station|Raynes Park]] to [[Dorking railway station|Dorking]] via [[Epsom railway station|Epsom]]\n**  The [[Chessington Branch Line|Chessington branch]] from [[Motspur Park railway station|Motspur Park]]\n**  The branch to Guildford from [[Leatherhead railway station|Leatherhead]]\n* The [[Kingston Loop Line]], from [[New Malden railway station|New Malden]] (Main Line) to [[Twickenham railway station|Twickenham]] (Reading Line)\n** The [[Shepperton railway station|Shepperton]] branch from [[Teddington railway station|Teddington]]; normally, these services run via New Malden, some peak services run via Twickenham\n*  The [[New Guildford Line]], to Guildford via [[Cobham & Stoke d'Abernon railway station|Cobham]] from [[Surbiton railway station|Surbiton]] (travellers from Guildford to London can also travel via the main line through Woking)\n* The [[Hampton Court railway station|Hampton Court]] branch, also from Surbiton\n* The [[Alton Line|Alton]] branch, from [[Brookwood railway station|Brookwood]] also serves the [[Mid Hants Railway]], a heritage line\n\n===Other services===\n* Southampton local lines: [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]] to [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] via [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]] and [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] (previously this service ran to [[Totton railway station|Totton]])\n* [[Lymington Branch Line]] ([[Brockenhurst railway station|Brockenhurst]] to [[Lymington Pier railway station|Lymington Pier]])\n*[[Island Line, Isle of Wight]], [[Ryde Pier Head railway station|Ryde Pier Head]] to [[Shanklin railway station|Shanklin]]\n* Southampton Central to [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station|Portsmouth & Southsea]]\n\n==Ticketing==\n===Travelcards===\nLondon [[Travelcards]] were available and widely used for journeys into Greater London beyond any of the South West Trains stations. They were valid on [[London Buses]], [[Tramlink]], [[Docklands Light Railway]], [[London Underground]] and national rail services within the London travelcard area. All tickets and (London) Travelcards were available on weekly, monthly and annual bases (such tickets are traditionally known as [[season ticket]]s), a pre-requisite for which is a passport-sized photograph for a booking hall to issue a nationally valid railcard.  All ticket pricing structures are regulated by the [[Office of Rail & Road]].\n\nDaily tickets fell into four categories: Peak 'Anytime', Off Peak, Super Off Peak and Advance (pre-booked, long distance). These were broken down into whether the user requires a ''Single'', ''Return'' (valid for one calendar month) or a ''Day Return.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/comparetickets.aspx#175751 |date=21 November 2015 |title=Single and Return Tickets|publisher = South West Trains|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127111727/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/comparetickets.aspx|archive-date=27 November 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Smartcards===\n[[Oyster card|Oyster pay-as-you-go]] could be used on services within [[Greater London]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/oysteronnationalrail.aspx |title=Passengers to benefit from roll-out of Oyster pay as you go to South West Trains services |publisher= South West Trains |accessdate=19 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127063838/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/oysteronnationalrail.aspx |archive-date=27 November 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Oyster cards holding season tickets were accepted within the London Travelcard area, in the same way as normal paper Travelcards and season tickets.\n\nIn November 2010, the DfT announced that passengers would be able to top up Oyster cards at all stations operated by South West Trains in the London Travelcard area from May 2011. SWT was the last rail company franchise to offer this facility (except at Wimbledon and Richmond stations) for passengers using suburban rail services within the London Travelcard area.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oyster-top-up-expansion-makes-journeys-easier-for-rail-users |title=Top up expansion makes journeys easier for rail users |date=12 November 2010 |publisher = Department for Transport}}</ref>\n\nThe smartcard scheme for tickets on the national rail system was extended in early 2010 to cover the lines from Weymouth to Basingstoke and from Staines to Wokingham, and on the Isle of Wight, in addition to the current trial area between Staines and Windsor.

However, the company had planned to install at least one self-service ticket machine at each of its served stations in the bid to stop [[fare evasion]]. In 2009, ticket gates were installed at Waterloo to improve revenue protection.<ref>\"Waterloo ticket gates longest in Europe\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1295 March 2009 page 76</ref>\n\n===Megatrain===\n{{Main|Megatrain}}\nStagecoach, SWT's parent company, sold seats on some off-peak services under the [[Megatrain]] brand from Mondays to Saturdays. This used a similar low-cost model to its [[Megabus (United Kingdom)|Megabus]] service. Megatrain tickets were available on certain services expected to be lightly loaded. Tickets were generally between London Waterloo and other principal stations, and ticket-holders are assigned to a specific train.\n\n==Performance==\nLatest performance figures released by [[Network Rail]] for period 5 (2014/15) were 88.2% ([[Public Performance Measure]] \u2013 PPM) and 88.9% (Moving Annual Average \u2013 MAA) for the 12&nbsp;months up to 16 August 2014.<ref name=\"PerfP7\">{{cite web| title = Rail performance results period 7 | url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performance/ | publisher = Network Rail | accessdate = 7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rolling stock==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Electric===\n====Desiro fleet====\nThe introduction of [[Desiro]] rolling stock built by [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] was to replace the old {{brc|411}}, {{brc|412}}, {{brc|421}} and {{brc|423}} [[slam-door trains]] which were coming to the end of their useful lives, and which did not meet modern health and safety requirements.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Desiro trains have on-board information systems and full air-conditioning. Their faster acceleration is counterbalanced by the need to dwell longer at each station, since they have fewer doors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe Desiro stock comes in two variants \u2013 {{brc|450}} units which have four 20&nbsp;m cars and are mainly used on suburban and outer-suburban services, and {{brc|444}} units which have five 23&nbsp;m cars as well as intercity-style door layouts and are used on longer-distance services to {{Stnlnk|Weymouth}} and {{Stnlnk|Portsmouth Harbour}}.\n\n====British Rail EMUs (Class 455)====\nSouth West Trains operated a fleet of {{brc|455}} metro-style commuter trains on services from London Waterloo to Shepperton, Hampton Court, Woking, Guildford, Dorking and Chessington, as well as services on the Kingston and Hounslow loops and occasionally on Windsor line services.

Deliveries of these trains began in 1998.\n\nThe class suffered major technical problems, so in the end, none of the older trains were withdrawn from service at that time. It was six more years, in 2004, before the full fleet was in service. In 2003 and 2004, reliability was so poor that, although they were only six years old, South West Trains decided that the units should be replaced by 2005 with the newer {{brc|450}} ''[[Desiro]]'' units.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3388679.stm |title=Train firm to replace new fleet |date=12 January 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Only a handful of units were required each day to help maintain services from Waterloo to Reading, and these had been expected to cease after 31 July 2006, when the lease with the rolling stock company expired. An application by SWT to extend this by six months was refused, as the class did not meet all the requirements of disability legislation.\n\nHowever, later it was decided that, on or before the start of the new franchise in February 2007, the class would be reinstated and take over all operations on the Waterloo to Reading line, indirectly covering the loss of the Class 442. They have been fitted with new, larger destination screens that comply with the disability legislation, but the trains still fall foul in some other areas, such as the height of the door-open buttons.\n\nAll 30 Class 458 trains were split up and the 120 vehicles reconfigured into 36 five-car sets, incorporating 60 extra vehicles from the mechanically similar {{brc|460}} formerly used on [[Gatwick Express]] services.<ref name=Rail25Jan12>{{cite news |title= Class 460 driving vehicles made redundant |author=Clinnick, Richard |work=Rail |location=Peterborough |date=25 January 2012 |page=28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Junipers United: Darth Vader goes suburban |author=Walmsley, Ian |work=Modern Railways |location=London |date=February 2012 |page=40}}</ref> The five-car sets are now designated Class 458/5 and coupled together to form ten-car trains from 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a342m for longer Waterloo trains |work=Rail |location=Peterborough |date=11 January 2012 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=SWT23Dec11>{{cite press release |url= http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/extracapacity.aspx |title=London commuters to benefit from longer peak time trains |publisher=South West Trains |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117060738/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/extracapacity.aspx |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first two of the five-car sets were delivered in October 2013, and underwent testing ahead of the introduction of the first ten-car train into service in December 2013.

In Greater London, it operated all National Rail services (other than London Overground) in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the London Boroughs of Richmond-upon-Thames and Hounslow, and also served the London Boroughs of Merton, Wandsworth and Lambeth.\n\nMost SWT services ran on electrified lines using the 750&nbsp;[[volts|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[third-rail]] system. There is a diesel fleet for services on the West of England line to Salisbury, Exeter and Bristol, using the unelectrified track beyond [[Worting Junction]] just west of Basingstoke, and for Salisbury to Southampton via Romsey services which also served Eastleigh. SWT operated almost 1,700 train services per day.\n\nFrom [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]], SWT's London terminus, long-distance trains ran to southern England, including the major coastal population centres of Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth. There were also trains to Reading, Exeter and Bristol, but these are not the principal fast services from London to those cities, which are operated from {{stnlink|London Paddington}} by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]]. The majority of its passengers were on suburban commuter lines in inner and south-west London, Surrey, east Berkshire, and north-east Hampshire.\n\nSince privatisation in 1996, the network changed considerably. It no longer served [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]], [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]], 'Coastway' stations between [[Chichester railway station|Chichester]] and [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], or the [[Reading\u2013Basingstoke line|Reading to Basingstoke line]]. Services to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] (introduced in 2004 to replace withdrawn [[Arriva Trains Wales]] services), [[Mottisfont & Dunbridge railway station|Mottisfont and Dunbridge]] and [[Dean railway station|Dean]] were introduced after the start of the franchise. Its longstanding services beyond [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter]] to [[Paignton railway station|Paignton]], [[Plymouth railway station|Plymouth]] and [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]], which ran in competition with [[First Great Western]] and its predecessors, ceased in December 2009 so as to release stock for the hourly Waterloo to Exeter service.<ref>{{cite news |work=Rail |location =Peterborough |issue= 595 |date=2 July 2008|title=SWT Exeter \u2013 Paignton / Plymouth will stop in December 2009. |page =20}}</ref>\n\nAs with most rail companies, non-folding bicycles were banned from peak-time trains to and from London. However, these restrictions applied only to cyclists boarding or alighting in the area bounded by Hook, Alton, Guildford, Reading and Dorking.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/cycle-policy.aspx |title=Cycle policy |publisher=South West Trains |accessdate=26 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430185237/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/cycle-policy.aspx|archive-date=30 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim was to maximise available passenger space on the most crowded trains.\n\nSouth West Trains had Quiet Zones, similar to the Quiet Coaches on trains operated by certain other Train Operating Companies. Quiet Zones are available on most outer-suburban services and on some express services and are indicated by notices in the windows and signs on the doors. Passengers in these zones are requested not to use mobile phones to take calls or play music out loud.\n\n===Routes===\nSouth West Trains operated suburban and long-distance trains. Main destinations included: [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]], [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]], {{stnlnk|Barnes}}, [[Richmond (London) station|Richmond]], [[Twickenham railway station|Twickenham]], [[Hounslow railway station|Hounslow]], [[Ascot railway station|Ascot]], [[Staines railway station|Staines]], [[Reading railway station|Reading]], [[Windsor & Eton Riverside railway station|Windsor & Eton Riverside]], [[Kingston (London) railway station|Kingston]], [[Raynes Park railway station|Raynes Park]], [[Motspur Park railway station|Motspur Park]], [[New Malden railway station|New Malden]], [[Chessington South railway station|Chessington South]], [[Surbiton railway station|Surbiton]], [[Leatherhead railway station|Leatherhead]], [[Weybridge railway station|Weybridge]], [[Dorking railway station|Dorking]], [[Effingham Junction railway station|Effingham Junction]], [[Woking railway station|Woking]], [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford]], [[Aldershot railway station|Aldershot]], [[Alton railway station|Alton]], [[Farnborough Main railway station|Farnborough Main]], [[Fleet railway station|Fleet]], [[Basingstoke railway station|Basingstoke]], [[Haslemere railway station|Haslemere]], [[Andover railway station|Andover]], [[Winchester railway station|Winchester]], [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]], [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]], [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]], [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]], [[Fareham railway station|Fareham]], [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station|Portsmouth & Southsea]], [[Brockenhurst railway station|Brockenhurst]], [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth Harbour]], [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]], [[Westbury railway station|Westbury]], [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]], [[Yeovil Junction railway station|Yeovil Junction]] and [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]].\n\n===Main lines===\n[[File:444029 at Woking.jpg|thumb|right|A [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444 Desiro]] unit used on longer-distance services on the electrified railway lines.]]\n[[File:Gb-emudc-455732-2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[British Rail Class 455|Class 455]] suburban unit at [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]].

The semi-fast service continues as a stopping service to Portsmouth. The fast services run approximately half-hourly Mondays-Saturdays, 2 trains per hour (1 fast, 1 stopping from Guildford) on Sundays.\n* The [[West of England Main Line]] to [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]], [[Yeovil Junction railway station|Yeovil Junction]] and {{stnlink|Exeter St Davids}}: leaves the main line at [[Basingstoke railway station|Basingstoke]].\n* [[Wessex Main Line]] (part): Salisbury to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]].

Hourly service off-peak Mondays-Saturdays, merges with the Poole train on Sundays.\n* London Waterloo to Reading via [[Staines-upon-Thames]], [[Ascot railway station|Ascot]] and {{Stnlnk|Wokingham}}.\n\n===Suburban services===\nSuburban services diverged from the above routes. Taken in order westwards from Waterloo, travelling down the SWML, they are:\n* [[Waterloo to Reading line]]: from [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]\n** The [[Hounslow Loop Line]] from Barnes to [[Whitton railway station|Whitton]] or [[Feltham railway station|Feltham]]\n** The [[Windsor & Eton Riverside railway station|Windsor]] branch from [[Staines railway station|Staines-upon-Thames]]\n** The [[Chertsey railway station|Chertsey]] loop line from [[Virginia Water railway station|Virginia Water]] to [[Weybridge railway station|Weybridge]]\n** The Ascot to [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford]] line via [[Aldershot railway station|Aldershot]]\n*  The [[Sutton & Mole Valley Line|Mole Valley Line]], from [[Raynes Park railway station|Raynes Park]] to [[Dorking railway station|Dorking]] via [[Epsom railway station|Epsom]]\n**  The [[Chessington Branch Line|Chessington branch]] from [[Motspur Park railway station|Motspur Park]]\n**  The branch to Guildford from [[Leatherhead railway station|Leatherhead]]\n* The [[Kingston Loop Line]], from [[New Malden railway station|New Malden]] (Main Line) to [[Twickenham railway station|Twickenham]] (Reading Line)\n** The [[Shepperton railway station|Shepperton]] branch from [[Teddington railway station|Teddington]]; normally, these services run via New Malden, some peak services run via Twickenham\n*  The [[New Guildford Line]], to Guildford via [[Cobham & Stoke d'Abernon railway station|Cobham]] from [[Surbiton railway station|Surbiton]] (travellers from Guildford to London can also travel via the main line through Woking)\n* The [[Hampton Court railway station|Hampton Court]] branch, also from Surbiton\n* The [[Alton Line|Alton]] branch, from [[Brookwood railway station|Brookwood]] also serves the [[Mid Hants Railway]], a heritage line\n\n===Other services===\n* Southampton local lines: [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]] to [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] via [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]] and [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] (previously this service ran to [[Totton railway station|Totton]])\n* [[Lymington Branch Line]] ([[Brockenhurst railway station|Brockenhurst]] to [[Lymington Pier railway station|Lymington Pier]])\n*[[Island Line, Isle of Wight]], [[Ryde Pier Head railway station|Ryde Pier Head]] to [[Shanklin railway station|Shanklin]]\n* Southampton Central to [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station|Portsmouth & Southsea]]\n\n==Ticketing==\n===Travelcards===\nLondon [[Travelcards]] were available and widely used for journeys into Greater London beyond any of the South West Trains stations. They were valid on [[London Buses]], [[Tramlink]], [[Docklands Light Railway]], [[London Underground]] and national rail services within the London travelcard area. All tickets and (London) Travelcards were available on weekly, monthly and annual bases (such tickets are traditionally known as [[season ticket]]s), a pre-requisite for which is a passport-sized photograph for a booking hall to issue a nationally valid railcard.  All ticket pricing structures are regulated by the [[Office of Rail & Road]].\n\nDaily tickets fell into four categories: Peak 'Anytime', Off Peak, Super Off Peak and Advance (pre-booked, long distance). These were broken down into whether the user requires a ''Single'', ''Return'' (valid for one calendar month) or a ''Day Return.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/comparetickets.aspx#175751 |date=21 November 2015 |title=Single and Return Tickets|publisher = South West Trains|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127111727/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/comparetickets.aspx|archive-date=27 November 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Smartcards===\n[[Oyster card|Oyster pay-as-you-go]] could be used on services within [[Greater London]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/oysteronnationalrail.aspx |title=Passengers to benefit from roll-out of Oyster pay as you go to South West Trains services |publisher= South West Trains |accessdate=19 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127063838/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/oysteronnationalrail.aspx |archive-date=27 November 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Oyster cards holding season tickets were accepted within the London Travelcard area, in the same way as normal paper Travelcards and season tickets.\n\nIn November 2010, the DfT announced that passengers would be able to top up Oyster cards at all stations operated by South West Trains in the London Travelcard area from May 2011. SWT was the last rail company franchise to offer this facility (except at Wimbledon and Richmond stations) for passengers using suburban rail services within the London Travelcard area.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oyster-top-up-expansion-makes-journeys-easier-for-rail-users |title=Top up expansion makes journeys easier for rail users |date=12 November 2010 |publisher = Department for Transport}}</ref>\n\nThe smartcard scheme for tickets on the national rail system was extended in early 2010 to cover the lines from Weymouth to Basingstoke and from Staines to Wokingham, and on the Isle of Wight, in addition to the current trial area between Staines and Windsor.

However, the company had planned to install at least one self-service ticket machine at each of its served stations in the bid to stop [[fare evasion]]. In 2009, ticket gates were installed at Waterloo to improve revenue protection.<ref>\"Waterloo ticket gates longest in Europe\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1295 March 2009 page 76</ref>\n\n===Megatrain===\n{{Main|Megatrain}}\nStagecoach, SWT's parent company, sold seats on some off-peak services under the [[Megatrain]] brand from Mondays to Saturdays. This used a similar low-cost model to its [[Megabus (United Kingdom)|Megabus]] service. Megatrain tickets were available on certain services expected to be lightly loaded. Tickets were generally between London Waterloo and other principal stations, and ticket-holders are assigned to a specific train.\n\n==Performance==\nLatest performance figures released by [[Network Rail]] for period 5 (2014/15) were 88.2% ([[Public Performance Measure]] \u2013 PPM) and 88.9% (Moving Annual Average \u2013 MAA) for the 12&nbsp;months up to 16 August 2014.<ref name=\"PerfP7\">{{cite web| title = Rail performance results period 7 | url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performance/ | publisher = Network Rail | accessdate = 7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rolling stock==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Electric===\n====Desiro fleet====\nThe introduction of [[Desiro]] rolling stock built by [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] was to replace the old {{brc|411}}, {{brc|412}}, {{brc|421}} and {{brc|423}} [[slam-door trains]] which were coming to the end of their useful lives, and which did not meet modern health and safety requirements.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Desiro trains have on-board information systems and full air-conditioning. Their faster acceleration is counterbalanced by the need to dwell longer at each station, since they have fewer doors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe Desiro stock comes in two variants \u2013 {{brc|450}} units which have four 20&nbsp;m cars and are mainly used on suburban and outer-suburban services, and {{brc|444}} units which have five 23&nbsp;m cars as well as intercity-style door layouts and are used on longer-distance services to {{Stnlnk|Weymouth}} and {{Stnlnk|Portsmouth Harbour}}.\n\n====British Rail EMUs (Class 455)====\nSouth West Trains operated a fleet of {{brc|455}} metro-style commuter trains on services from London Waterloo to Shepperton, Hampton Court, Woking, Guildford, Dorking and Chessington, as well as services on the Kingston and Hounslow loops and occasionally on Windsor line services.

Deliveries of these trains began in 1998.\n\nThe class suffered major technical problems, so in the end, none of the older trains were withdrawn from service at that time. It was six more years, in 2004, before the full fleet was in service. In 2003 and 2004, reliability was so poor that, although they were only six years old, South West Trains decided that the units should be replaced by 2005 with the newer {{brc|450}} ''[[Desiro]]'' units.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3388679.stm |title=Train firm to replace new fleet |date=12 January 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Only a handful of units were required each day to help maintain services from Waterloo to Reading, and these had been expected to cease after 31 July 2006, when the lease with the rolling stock company expired. An application by SWT to extend this by six months was refused, as the class did not meet all the requirements of disability legislation.\n\nHowever, later it was decided that, on or before the start of the new franchise in February 2007, the class would be reinstated and take over all operations on the Waterloo to Reading line, indirectly covering the loss of the Class 442. They have been fitted with new, larger destination screens that comply with the disability legislation, but the trains still fall foul in some other areas, such as the height of the door-open buttons.\n\nAll 30 Class 458 trains were split up and the 120 vehicles reconfigured into 36 five-car sets, incorporating 60 extra vehicles from the mechanically similar {{brc|460}} formerly used on [[Gatwick Express]] services.<ref name=Rail25Jan12>{{cite news |title= Class 460 driving vehicles made redundant |author=Clinnick, Richard |work=Rail |location=Peterborough |date=25 January 2012 |page=28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Junipers United: Darth Vader goes suburban |author=Walmsley, Ian |work=Modern Railways |location=London |date=February 2012 |page=40}}</ref> The five-car sets are now designated Class 458/5 and coupled together to form ten-car trains from 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a342m for longer Waterloo trains |work=Rail |location=Peterborough |date=11 January 2012 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=SWT23Dec11>{{cite press release |url= http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/extracapacity.aspx |title=London commuters to benefit from longer peak time trains |publisher=South West Trains |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117060738/http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/extracapacity.aspx |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first two of the five-car sets were delivered in October 2013, and underwent testing ahead of the introduction of the first ten-car train into service in December 2013.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when [[AT&T]], owner of [[DirecTV]], came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.  Disputes in negotiations  included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an [[A la carte pay television|\"a la carte\"]] basis.\n\n==History==\n\nIn late 2012, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended. Reports published at that time indicated that the team was negotiating with other potential broadcasters, such as the recently established [[Time Warner Cable SportsNet (Los Angeles)|Time Warner Cable SportsNet]], and contemplating forming an in-house network with [[Dick Clark Productions]], a television production company recently purchased by the Dodgers' new parent company, [[Guggenheim Partners]].<ref name=forbes-dcdodgers>{{cite web|last=Ozanian|first=Mark|date=December 14, 2012|title=Dodgers Exploring TV Deal With Dick Clark Productions|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2012/12/14/dodgers-exploring-tv-deal-with-dick-clark-productions/|work=Forbes|access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2013, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that [[Time Warner Cable]] had signed a deal to partner with the Dodgers to form a new regional sports network, which would be majority-owned by the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaikin |first=Bill |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-time-warner-20130122,0,471512.story |title=Dodgers, Time Warner Cable have a deal |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=January 22, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn January 28, the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable signed a 25-year broadcast agreement valued at $8.35 billion,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodgers-tv-standoff-20140718-story.html?track=rss#page=1|title = Standoff over Dodgers games could be defining moment in sports TV|last = Flint|first = Joe|date = July 17, 2014|work = Los Angeles Times|access-date = November 2, 2016}}</ref> subject to the approval of Major League Baseball, which would see the establishment of a new channel known as '''SportsNet LA'''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa |first=Mike |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/21620862/dodgers-announce-deal-with-time-warner-launch-of-sportsnet-la |title=Dodgers announce deal with Time Warner, launch of SportsNet LA |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | date=January 28, 2013 | access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref> The deal ended long-standing broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West, which had aired Dodgers games on its ''Prime Ticket'' channel since [[1997 MLB season|1997]]; and with [[KCAL-TV]], an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] which had been the Dodgers' over-the-air broadcast television outlet since [[2006 MLB season|2006]]. TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by ''Prime Ticket'' in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of [[spring training]], and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future. While the channel is not directly branded with the Dodgers' name, its logo incorporates the team's interlocking \"LA\" insignia; team co-owner Todd Boehly stated that the decision was \"something [Time Warner Cable] thought was really valuable to their brand.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when [[AT&T]], owner of [[DirecTV]], came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.  Disputes in negotiations  included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an [[A la carte pay television|\"a la carte\"]] basis.\n\n==History==\n\nIn late 2012, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended.

TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by ''Prime Ticket'' in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of [[spring training]], and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future.
