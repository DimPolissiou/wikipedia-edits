At the lab, Patterson figures out too late that the dolls contain a powerful pathogen agent that gets released, putting the building in quarantine, with Rich, Patterson and Reade trapped in the lab and Jane trapped in the office. A biohazard team is sent to hazard the situation, but the lead officer sent was the one who created the bioweapon and was experimenting on the trapped FBI agents to test how effective it was.

After being captured, Barry is killed in an attack orchestrated by Masters. The team is forced to bring Burke for questioning, but she remains uncooperative. She finally gives Masters' private phone number to be hacked. The team finds and guns down Masters, but they unsuccessfully try to stop the plan: a computer virus is released into the system of a power grid that controls the Eastern Seaboard and the whole country is thrown into chaos after the power is cut.\n| LineColor       = BFC8D4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 89\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 22\n| Title           = The Gang Gets Gone\n| DirectedBy      = David McWhirter\n| WrittenBy       = Chris Pozzebon\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|5|31}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10072\n| Viewers         = 2.05<ref name=\"4.21&4.22\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = The disruption of the power grid continues to spread across the country, while divisions within the team become evident as a number of secrets come out.

They arrive to find it was a trap designed to incriminate them, but with help from a contact of Rich, Ice Cream, they escape and all meet up at a remote cottage. In New York, Rich tries to help the team and decrypt a Helios file. Before he can finish, Madeleine, with the assistance of Lucas Nash, and later her lawyer Richard Shirley, turn the tables on Director Weitz and force him to release her and recant the charges. As Madeline's intentions to destroy the FBI become evident, there are mounting accusations that the team has gone rogue, and Nash arranges a drone strike which destroys the cottage with everyone, save Jane, inside.\n| LineColor       = BFC8D4\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 5===\n<!--Per WP:TVUPCOMING, do not include 2020 until episodes have actually aired in 2020!-->\n{{Episode table|background=#0CA1F1|overall=5|season=5|title=27|director=11|writer=20|writerR=<ref name=\"WGA\" />|airdate=13|airdateR=<ref name=futoncritic>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/blindspot/listings/|title=Shows A-Z blindspot on nbc|author=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>|prodcode=8|viewers=11|country=US|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 90\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = I Came To Sleigh\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = Chris Pozzebon\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|30}}\n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 91\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = We Didn't Start The Fire\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = Eric Buchman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|7}}\n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 92\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Existential Ennui\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = Ryan Johnson & Peter Lalayanis\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|14}}\n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 93\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = And My Axel\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 94\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Head Games\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 95\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = Fire & Brimstone\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 96\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Awl In\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 97\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Ghost Train\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 98\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Brass Tacks\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 99\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Love You To Bits and Bytes\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 100\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Iunne Ennul\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 0CA1F1\n}}\n}}\n\nThe writers of the next five episodes of the fifth season are Matt Young, Brendan Gall, Rachel Caris Love, Anne Hecker, and Eric Buchman, respectively.

They also find an older [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] tattoo that was covered up. One of her tattoos is an address in Chinese characters, leading them to the terrorist Chao. Jane and Weller stop him, which triggers a memory of Jane running a shooting course supervised by an unknown man. This man also appears at the hospital to kill Chao. A flashback shows how the same man has given Jane the amnesia drug at her request.

He attains control over an armed drone and kills both his former boss and another pilot who had turned him in as a whistleblower. Gibson intends to destroy the drone program by bombing the pilots' operation center. Patterson locates his signal and Weller and Jane stop him. Jane is haunted by flashbacks of killing a nun and suffers from remorse. She eventually remembers that it was really a disguised soldier from whom she took a USB key. Weller notices a scar on Jane's neck which coincides with a scar of Taylor Shaw, a childhood friend who went missing 25 years ago, and he becomes certain that Jane is Taylor. His father was accused of kidnapping and murdering Taylor, which split up their family.

Casey Robek is injured while robbing a jewelry store. He has the same Navy SEALs tattoo as Jane. When he wakes up in the hospital after surgery, he signals Jane that he knows her, but then his brother Travis abducts him. Travis lets himself get killed rather than be arrested, and Casey whispers the word \"Orion\" to Jane before he dies. A DNA test confirms that Jane is Taylor Shaw, Weller's childhood neighbor. To Reade's dismay, Jane becomes an official member of the team. Mayfair meets with Tom Carter, Deputy Director of the [[CIA]], to discuss the secret operation \"Daylight\".

Patterson asks Mayfair to see the non-redacted Guerrero file, but is denied, presumably to protect agents in the field. Carter demands to interrogate Jane himself, but Mayfair refuses. Weller tells Jane about Taylor's past. However, a test that Patterson ran on Jane's tooth shows that she was born in Africa \u2013 this contradicts the DNA which matched Taylor Shaw.

Dodi is rescued by his team and builds a [[Dirty bomb|radiological bomb]], but is stopped by the FBI. Carter shows up on site and is about to shoot Jane, but Mayfair stops him. He openly demands either Dodi or Jane for the CIA, so Mayfair gives up Dodi. Weller's father, Bill, visits Sarah, but Weller refuses to reconcile.

Lee wants the Book of Secrets in return for the stem cells, which leads Patterson and Rich to a treasure hunt throughout [[Peru]], following the last bits of Roman's trail. They find the missing information that Roman wasn't able to find by himself. Over in the mountains of [[Machu Picchu]], Rich digs up the Book of Secrets from the ground. It is revealed that Lee was planning to double-cross them, but Weller and the team were one step ahead and have the local police stop him. Defeated, Lee accepts a deal: the stem cells for house arrest. Upon retrieving the cells, Jane is cured and her sight is restored. Meanwhile, Zapata takes Boston in place of Del Toro.

Things get complicated when the real Del Toro shows up. Seeing that Madeline is onto them, Zapata convinces Boston to save the people aboard. Meanwhile, the team brings in the head of security of HCI Global's rival company Bradley Dynamics, who reveals that the plane they worked on was the new Air Force One. The team later realizes that Weitz is aboard there for a meeting. In Madeline's building, Zapata manages to kill Del Toro, and Boston takes control of his computer, which ultimately prevents the plane from crashing. Unbeknownst to both, Madeline had her henchman Dominic plant explosives throughout the building. After the explosion, Zapata disappears while Madeline and Dominic manage to get away. Back at the FBI, the house arrest on Boston is dropped and Reade offers him a job, which he turns down. Burke goes into hiding, planning on initiating an operation called Helios. Later that night, Jane and Weller receive an envelope from a lawyer looking after Shepherd's estate, which contains a new picture puzzle for her to solve. Zapata calls Reade, telling him that she's heading off to Zurich, planning to retrieve files that contain evidence against Madeline, as a way to show her loyalty to him.

With the woman responsible in prison, everything points to a copycat. The FBI receives a call from the copycat, claiming that Lilly, the woman imprisoned, was set up by someone from the team. A flashback reveals that it was Weitz who pressured Stuart to alter evidence from a video that showed Lilly dropping off a package to the site of one of the bombings. A new lead points the team to suspect Lilly's father. Weitz blocks them from making an arrest and authorizes a drone strike to take him out in order to cover his own tracks. Just as he thinks he is clear, Weitz receives a call from the real copycat, who is revealed to be Dominic. He threatens to expose Weitz unless he cooperates for a favor.

He wants to create a dirty bomb that will detonate in a military meeting as a means to avenge his firing. A guilt-ridden Jane confesses to him that she was the one responsible for getting him fired in the first place. An unstable Cameron aims to detonate the device anyways, but is shot by Weller. Meanwhile, Keaton awakens from his coma.

The team competes in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]], after winning promotion out of the [[National League (division)|National League]] in the 2018\u201319 season. They have played home fixtures at [[Moor Lane]] since 1978.\n\nThe club was founded as ''Salford Central'' in 1940 and played minor local league football until winning a place in the [[Manchester Football League|Manchester League]] in 1963. They won the Lancashire Amateur Cup in 1973, 1975 and 1977 and the [[Manchester Premier Cup]] in 1978 and 1979. They joined the [[Cheshire County League]] in 1980, which amalgamated into the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] two years later. They became ''Salford City'' in 1989 and secured promotion into the [[Northern Premier League]] at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nIn 2014, Salford were taken over by former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] players [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Phil Neville]], [[Paul Scholes]] and [[Nicky Butt]], who each own 10% of the club, with businessman [[Peter Lim]] owning the rest; [[David Beckham]] purchased a 10% share from [[Singapore]]an businessman Peter Lim in January 2019. They were crowned Northern Premier League Division One North champions in 2014\u201315, before winning the Premier Division play-offs in 2016. Salford won the [[National League North]] title in the 2017\u201318 campaign and then secured a place in the [[English Football League]] after winning the 2019 National League play-off final under the stewardship of [[Graham Alexander]].\n\n==History==\n===1940 to 1982: Salford Central===\nThe club was founded in 1940 as Salford Central. It competed in local leagues until 1963, when it was promoted to the [[Manchester Football League]] and changed its name to Salford Amateurs. Nicknamed \"the Ammies\", the club won the Lancashire Amateur Cup in 1973, 1975 and 1977 and the [[Manchester Premier Cup]] in 1978 and 1979.

In 1990, it returned to the final of the Manchester Premier Cup, losing to [[Curzon Ashton F.C.|Curzon Ashton]]; it also entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. They were relegated out of Division One into Division Two at the end of the [[1990\u201391 North West Counties Football League|1990\u201391]] season, though a league restructuring saw them promoted again [[1991\u201392 North West Counties Football League|the following season]]. The club made another appearance in the final of the Manchester Premier Cup in 2002, this time losing to [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]].\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, the club reached the third round of the [[FA Vase]]. In 2005\u201306, it reached the third qualifying round of the FA Cup and also won the North West Counties League Cup, beating [[Cammell Laird 1907 F.C.|Cammell Laird]] in the final.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season Salford, under the management of Gary Fellows, finished second in Division One of the North West Counties League and were thus promoted to Division One North of the [[Northern Premier League]], the eighth tier of the [[English football league system]].\n\n===2010 to 2014: Northern Premier League===\nThe club suffered a difficult start in the Northern Premier League, losing six of their first seven matches, which resulted in Fellows being relieved of his managerial duties in October 2008<ref>{{cite news |last=Rodgers |first=Tom |date=3 October 2008 |title=Salford City Gaffer sacked |url=http://www.salfordonline.com/sport_page/8837-salford_city_gaffer_sacked.html |url-status=dead |publisher=Salford Online News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102108/http://www.salfordonline.com/sport_page/8837-salford_city_gaffer_sacked.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref> and former [[Bridlington Town A.F.C.|Bridlington Town]] and [[Stockport Sports F.C.|Stockport Sports]] boss Ashley Berry taking over.<ref>{{cite news |title=City appoint Berry as boss |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-appoint-berry-as-boss-971066 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> After only two months, with results still not improving, Berry left and was replaced by former [[Flixton F.C.|Flixton]] boss Paul Wright.<ref>{{cite news |title=City get Wright man for the job |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-get-wright-man-for-the-job-906660 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> Due to a pre-existing suspension from [[the Football Association]], Wright was unable to start work until March, so his assistant manager, Neil Hall, deputised for the first two months of 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Salford City FC \u2013 The Great Escape |url=http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=44 |publisher=Salford Star |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> By the time Wright took up his position, Salford were languishing at the bottom of the league, having achieved one win and a total of eight points from their first 26 games, leaving them 15 points adrift from safety.

Results improved under Giggs with team finishing the season in 12th position. The club began well in [[2011\u201312 Northern Premier League|2011\u201312]] with hopes of a playoff push, however a poor run of form at the start of 2012, combined with the frequent departure of the club's top players, resulted in a mid-table finish.
