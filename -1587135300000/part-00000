In 1917, he was a leader of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], supporting the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]]. He was the uncle of [[Alexander Berkman]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nMark Natanson was born in 1850 in [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]], [[Lithuania]] to a [[Jewish]] family. His parents died while he was still young, so he was brought up by his uncle. He graduated from the Kovno men's grammar school in 1868, studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868\u201371) and then at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. \n\n===The populist movement===\nTogether with his first wife, he was one of the organizers of the populist [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. They opposed the '[[nihilistic]]' tendency of [[Sergei Nechaev]], who believed that any means were acceptable for achieving revolutionary goals. The Circle of Tchaikovsky, on the contrary, preached high morality and self-improvement <ref>{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/memoirs/memoirstoc.html|date=1899|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>. In 1869-71 he was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and in 1872 he was exiled to the [[Arkhangelsk]] province. In the same 1872 he converted to [[Orthodoxy]] in order to formally marry the noblewoman [[:ru:\u0428\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Olga Alexandrovna Shleisner]] who followed him into exile <ref>{{cite article|title=Nathanson Mark|publisher=[[Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia]]|language=ru}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1876, Natanson returned to [[Petrograd]]. He organized the escape abroad of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a comrade from the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In the same year, he began work on the unification of the [[Narodnik]] circles into a single revolutionary organization, which in 1878 was called \"[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]].\" In December 1876, together with [[Georgi Plekhanov]], he organized a demonstration in [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan square]]. In 1877, he was once again arrested and, after serving his term in the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]].<ref name=MH>Mandred Hildermeier, ''The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382.</ref> Upon returning from exile in 1889, he settled in [[Saratov]], where he got a job on the local railway.\n\nAfter 'Land and Liberty' split, he once again began work on the unification of disparate revolutionary circles. He set himself the goal of uniting the populist, social democratic and liberal movements in the Russian liberation movement. In September 1893, at the constituent congress in Saratov, a single party, '[[The People's Will]]' (Narodnaya Volya), was created. The organization's headquarters were in [[Oryol]] and they ran a printing house in [[Smolensk]], which printed the group's manifesto and revolutionary brochures. Narodnaya Volya favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals, rather than spreading propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the '[[Black Repartition]]' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881, they assassinated [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]. Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act. In April 1894, Narodnaya Volya was liquidated by the police administrator [[Sergei Zubatov]], and its leaders were arrested. In exile in [[Yakutsk]], he married [[Varvara Alexandrova]].\n\nWhen a shipyard was organized for the construction of a ferry crossing on [[Lake Baikal]], the Corps of Ship Engineers needed an experienced and honest accountant, and Natanson took the job. His merits in organizing the construction are confirmed by the fact that on June 17, 1899, at the gala dinner in honor of the launch of the icebreaker \"Baikal\", there was a toast pronounced in honor of the political exile.\n\n===People's Rights Party===\nAfter his release he returned to [[European Russia]] and became active in [[Saratov]], where in 1893 he founded the party [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).''<ref name=MH /> Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.<ref>Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64.</ref> However, the People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years.<ref name=MH /> Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.<ref name=MH />\n\nUpon returning from exile, he lived in [[Baku]], where he worked as an accountant in the city government. In 1904 he emigrated to [[Switzerland]], where he met with [[Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov]]<ref>{{cite book|first=N.K.|last=Krupskaya|title=Memoirs of V.I. Lenin|chapter=Memories of Lenin|date=1979}}</ref>. By this time, the Russian liberation movement had finally divided into [[social-democratic]], [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[populist]] movements. In 1902, the followers of the [[Narodniks]] united into the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]]. After some hesitation, Nathanson joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became one of their leaders. The successful assassination of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], Natanson began to support the terrorist tactics of the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nThe tactical position adopted by the SRs represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by [[Peoples of the Caucasus|South Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] populists, the factory organisation favoured by the People's Rights Party and the terrorist tactics embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and Petrograd. In September 1904, together with [[Viktor Chernov]] and [[Yevno Azef]], he negotiated with Plekhanov, Ulyanov and other social democrats in order to convince them to take part in the common cause. During the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], Natanson moved in [[Finland]]. At the first congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in early 1906, he was elected a member of the Party Central Committee. After the revolution was put down, he returned to exile in Switzerland.\n\nNatanson still held a reserved position in relation to the party\u2019s terrorist tactics. In 1906, he was an opponent of the assassination of [[George Gapon]], the decision on which was made without his consent <ref>{{cite book|last=Khazan|first=V.|title=Pinchas Rutenberg. From terrorist to Zionist.|publisher=Gesharim|date=2008}}</ref>. At his insistence, the party refused to take responsibility for this murder <ref>{{cite article|last=Rutenberg|first=Pinchas|title=The assassination of Gapon|publisher=Leningrad|date=1925}}</ref>. In 1907, he opposed the plan for the murder of [[Nicholas II]], developed by Azef and [[Grigory Gershuni]] <ref>{{cite article|last=Nikolaevsky|first=B.|title=The story of a traitor (Azef).|date=1991|url=https://archive.is/20120713004215/readr.ru/b-nikolaevskiy-istoriya-odnogo-predatelya.html%23page=2|accessdate=April 13, 2020|language=ru}}</ref>. However, in 1908, when [[Vladimir Burtsev]] began a campaign to expose Azef as an [[Agent provocateur|agent provocateur]], Nathanson defended Azef. Until the very end, he refused to believe in Azef\u2019s cooperation with the [[secret police]]. In his memoirs, Burtsev wrote that Natanson was the most evil of his opponents <ref>{{cite book|last=Burtsev|first=Vladimir|title=In pursuit of provocateurs|publisher=Contemporary|date=1989}}</ref>.\n\n===Years of exile===\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, the SRs, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Internationalists]]' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] and one at [[Kienthal Conference|Kienthal]] in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists.<ref name=MH />\n\nNatanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the SRs.\n\n===Founder of the Left SRs===\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] broke out, Natanson returned to Russia through German territory \u201cin a sealed wagon\u201d <ref name=\"Chernov\">{{cite article|last=Chernov|first=V.M.|title=In the party of socialist revolutionaries: Memories of eight leaders. |date=2007|url=http://ldn-knigi.lib.ru/R/Tshernow.htm|language=ru}}</ref>. He became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the SRs, which became increasingly disenchanted with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and with [[Alexander Kerensky]] and sharply criticized the defensive position of the of the SR central committee. Natanson advocated the \u201cdeepening\u201d of the revolution - the transfer of all land to peasants, and power to the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]. Natanson and the \"Left SRs\" supported the [[October Revolution]], causing a split in the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In November 1917, he initiated the creation of the party of [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]]. At the first Left SR congress, he was elected to the Presidium, and then to the Central Committee of the new party. \n\nThe Left SRs rejected the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] (later superseded by the [[Versailles treaty]]), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia. The Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some [[Left SR uprising|took up arms]] against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the [[Party of Revolutionary Communism]], which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the [[Communist Party of the USSR]]. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union. In 1919, due to fear of arrest, he once again went into exile. \u201cI have complete discord with Lenin ... I no longer believe in Lenin,\u201d he told his relatives <ref name=\"Chernov\"/>.\n\n===Death and legacy===\nIn July 1919, Mark Natanson died in Switzerland from complications (thromboembolism and purulent pneumonia) after a surgical operation for a prostate tumor. He is buried in Bern.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition, Moscow, 1970\u20131979.\n* Aptekman, O.

In 1917, he was a leader of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], supporting the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]]. He was the uncle of [[Alexander Berkman]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nMark Natanson was born in 1850 in [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]], [[Lithuania]] to a [[Jewish]] family. His parents died while he was still young, so he was brought up by his uncle. He graduated from the Kovno men's grammar school in 1868, studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868\u201371) and then at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. \n\n===The populist movement===\nTogether with his first wife, he was one of the organizers of the populist [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. They opposed the '[[nihilistic]]' tendency of [[Sergei Nechaev]], who believed that any means were acceptable for achieving revolutionary goals. The Circle of Tchaikovsky, on the contrary, preached high morality and self-improvement <ref>{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/memoirs/memoirstoc.html|date=1899|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>. In 1869-71 he was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and in 1872 he was exiled to the [[Arkhangelsk]] province. In the same 1872 he converted to [[Orthodoxy]] in order to formally marry the noblewoman [[:ru:\u0428\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Olga Alexandrovna Shleisner]] who followed him into exile <ref>{{cite article|title=Nathanson Mark|publisher=[[Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia]]|language=ru}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1876, Natanson returned to [[Petrograd]]. He organized the escape abroad of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a comrade from the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In the same year, he began work on the unification of the [[Narodnik]] circles into a single revolutionary organization, which in 1878 was called \"[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]].\" In December 1876, together with [[Georgi Plekhanov]], he organized a demonstration in [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan square]]. In 1877, he was once again arrested and, after serving his term in the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]].<ref name=MH>Mandred Hildermeier, ''The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382.</ref> Upon returning from exile in 1889, he settled in [[Saratov]], where he got a job on the local railway.\n\nAfter 'Land and Liberty' split, he once again began work on the unification of disparate revolutionary circles. He set himself the goal of uniting the populist, social democratic and liberal movements in the Russian liberation movement. In September 1893, at the constituent congress in Saratov, a single party, '[[The People's Will]]' (Narodnaya Volya), was created. The organization's headquarters were in [[Orel]] and they ran a printing house in [[Smolensk]], which printed the group's manifesto and revolutionary brochures. Narodnaya Volya favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals, rather than spreading propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the '[[Black Repartition]]' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881, they assassinated [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]. Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act. In April 1894, Narodnaya Volya was liquidated by the police administrator [[Sergei Zubatov]], and its leaders were arrested. In exile in [[Yakutsk]], he married [[Varvara Alexandrova]].\n\nWhen a shipyard was organized for the construction of a ferry crossing on [[Lake Baikal]], the Corps of Ship Engineers needed an experienced and honest accountant, and Natanson took the job. His merits in organizing the construction are confirmed by the fact that on June 17, 1899, at the gala dinner in honor of the launch of the icebreaker \"Baikal\", there was a toast pronounced in honor of the political exile.\n\n===People's Rights Party===\nAfter his release he returned to [[European Russia]] and became active in [[Saratov]], where in 1893 he founded the party [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).''<ref name=MH /> Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.<ref>Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64.</ref> However, the People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years.<ref name=MH /> Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.<ref name=MH />\n\nUpon returning from exile, he lived in [[Baku]], where he worked as an accountant in the city government. In 1904 he emigrated to [[Switzerland]], where he met with [[Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov]]<ref>{{cite book|first=N.K.|last=Krupskaya|title=Memoirs of V.I. Lenin|chapter=Memories of Lenin|date=1979}}</ref>. By this time, the Russian liberation movement had finally divided into [[social-democratic]], [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[populist]] movements. In 1902, the followers of the [[Narodniks]] united into the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]]. After some hesitation, Nathanson joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became one of their leaders. The successful assassination of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], Natanson began to support the terrorist tactics of the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nThe tactical position adopted by the SRs represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by [[Peoples of the Caucasus|South Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] populists, the factory organisation favoured by the People's Rights Party and the terrorist tactics embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and Petrograd. In September 1904, together with [[Viktor Chernov]] and [[Yevno Azef]], he negotiated with Plekhanov, Ulyanov and other social democrats in order to convince them to take part in the common cause. During the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], Natanson moved in [[Finland]]. At the first congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in early 1906, he was elected a member of the Party Central Committee. After the revolution was put down, he returned to exile in Switzerland.\n\nNatanson still held a reserved position in relation to the party\u2019s terrorist tactics. In 1906, he was an opponent of the assassination of [[George Gapon]], the decision on which was made without his consent <ref>{{cite book|last=Khazan|first=V.|title=Pinchas Rutenberg. From terrorist to Zionist.|publisher=Gesharim|date=2008}}</ref>. At his insistence, the party refused to take responsibility for this murder <ref>{{cite article|last=Rutenberg|first=Pinchas|title=The assassination of Gapon|publisher=Leningrad|date=1925}}</ref>. In 1907, he opposed the plan for the murder of [[Nicholas II]], developed by Azef and [[Grigory Gershuni]] <ref>{{cite article|last=Nikolaevsky|first=B.|title=The story of a traitor (Azef).|date=1991|url=https://archive.is/20120713004215/readr.ru/b-nikolaevskiy-istoriya-odnogo-predatelya.html%23page=2|accessdate=April 13, 2020|language=ru}}</ref>. However, in 1908, when [[Vladimir Burtsev]] began a campaign to expose Azef as an [[Agent provocateur|agent provocateur]], Nathanson defended Azef. Until the very end, he refused to believe in Azef\u2019s cooperation with the [[secret police]]. In his memoirs, Burtsev wrote that Natanson was the most evil of his opponents <ref>{{cite book|last=Burtsev|first=Vladimir|title=In pursuit of provocateurs|publisher=Contemporary|date=1989}}</ref>.\n\n===Years of exile===\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, the SRs, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Internationalists]]' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] and one at [[Kienthal Conference|Kienthal]] in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists.<ref name=MH />\n\nNatanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the SRs.\n\n===Founder of the Left SRs===\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] broke out, Natanson returned to Russia through German territory \u201cin a sealed wagon\u201d <ref name=\"Chernov\">{{cite article|last=Chernov|first=V.M.|title=In the party of socialist revolutionaries: Memories of eight leaders. |date=2007|url=http://ldn-knigi.lib.ru/R/Tshernow.htm|language=ru}}</ref>. He became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the SRs, which became increasingly disenchanted with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and with [[Alexander Kerensky]] and sharply criticized the defensive position of the of the SR central committee. Natanson advocated the \u201cdeepening\u201d of the revolution - the transfer of all land to peasants, and power to the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]. Natanson and the \"Left SRs\" supported the [[October Revolution]], causing a split in the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In November 1917, he initiated the creation of the party of [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]]. At the first Left SR congress, he was elected to the Presidium, and then to the Central Committee of the new party. \n\nThe Left SRs rejected the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] (later superseded by the [[Versailles treaty]]), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia. The Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some [[Left SR uprising|took up arms]] against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the [[Party of Revolutionary Communism]], which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the [[Communist Party of the USSR]]. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union. In 1919, due to fear of arrest, he once again went into exile. \u201cI have complete discord with Lenin ... I no longer believe in Lenin,\u201d he told his relatives <ref name=\"Chernov\"/>.\n\n===Death and legacy===\nIn July 1919, Mark Natanson died in Switzerland from complications (thromboembolism and purulent pneumonia) after a surgical operation for a prostate tumor. He is buried in Bern.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition, Moscow, 1970\u20131979.\n* Aptekman, O.

These operations are known as [[Animal feeding operation|AFO]] or [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation|CAFO]] in the U.S. In this system of pig production, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are housed in [[gestation crate]]s or pens and give birth in farrowing crates.\n\nThe use of gestation crates for pregnant sows has resulted in lower birth production costs; however, this practice has led to more significant [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]]. Many of the world's largest producers of pigs ([[United States|US]], [[China]], [[Mexico]]) use gestation crates but some nations and nine US states have banned and removed these crates. The [[European Union]] has banned the use of gestation crates after the 4th week of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Werblow|first1=Steve|title=Gestation crates: News from the front lines|url=http://www.porknetwork.com/pork-magazine/Gestation-crates-News-from-the-front-lines-242240401.html|accessdate=3 October 2015|publisher=Pork Network|date=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pig-breeding-factory.jpg|thumb|Sows in gestation crates.]]\n[[File:Cerdo Iberico Los Valhondos Pelayos Salamanca.jpg|thumb|A young piglet, note the dismembered tail to the left.]]\n[[File:Results of tail docking a piglet at Iowa Select Farms, taken by Mercy for Animals in 2011.jpg|thumb|The result of [[Docking (animal)|tail docking]] a piglet.]]\n[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb|Indoor group pens, note the slatted floor designed for waste removal.]]\nIntensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings or barns with little exposure to sunlight or the outdoors.

Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated.\n\nMost domestic pig varieties are susceptible to sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio.

Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills. Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group in age groups. Larger swine operations use slotted floors for waste removal, and deliver bulk feed into feeders in each pen; feed is available ad libitum.\n\nPigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]). Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[vitamins]] and [[Subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine|antibiotic]]s are administered preemptively.\n\nIndoor systems allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a [[anaerobic lagoon|lagoon system]] or other waste-management system. However, waste smell remains a problem which is difficult to manage.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://asae.frymulti.com/abstract.asp?aid=15521&t=2 |title=Spatial Variability Of Odor Emissions From Anaerobic Piggery Lagoons In Queensland |author1=G.

Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.) They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as [[denitrification]] of soil<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/agro/pdf/2002/07/19.pdf|title=The fate of nitrogen in outdoor pig production|website=Edpsciences.org|accessdate=28 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831180921/http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/agro/pdf/2002/07/19.pdf|archive-date=31 August 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625192517/http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> and erosion.

Some breeds of pig commonly used in intensive farming have been selectively bred to suit intensive conditions. Lean pink-pigmented pigs are unsuited for outdoor agriculture, as they suffer sunburn and heat stress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In certain environmental conditions \u2013 for example, a temperate climate \u2013 outdoor pig farming of these breeds is possible. However, there are many other breeds of pig suited to outdoor rearing, as they have been used in this way for centuries, such as [[Gloucester Old Spot]] and [[Oxford Forest]]. Following the UK ban of sow stalls, the British Pig Executive indicates that the pig farming industry in the UK has declined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpex.org/technical/general/pdf/marketupdate-sept05.pdf|title=British Pig Executive market update September 2005|website=Bpex.org|accessdate=28 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227150253/http://www.bpex.org/technical/general/pdf/marketupdate-sept05.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The increase in production costs<ref>[http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/another-move-away-pork-crates-/25/59594 \"Another Move Away from Pork Crates,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725210103/http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/another-move-away-pork-crates-/25/59594 |date=2012-07-25 }} Farm Futures, May 8, 2012.</ref> has led to British pig-products being more expensive than those from other countries, leading to increased imports and the need to position UK pork as a product deserving a price premium.\n\nIn 1997, [[Grampian Country Foods]], then the UK's largest pig producer, pointed out that pigmeat production costs in the UK were 44 p/kg higher than on the continent. Grampian stated that only 2 p/kg of this was due to the ban on stalls; the majority of the extra costs resulted from the then strength of sterling and the fact that at that time meat and bone meal had been banned in the UK but not on the continent. A study by the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1999, the year that the gestation crate ban came into force, found that moving from gestation crates, to group housing added just 1.6 pence to the cost of producing 1&nbsp;kg of pigmeat. French and Dutch studies show that even in the higher welfare group housing systems \u2013 ones giving more space and straw \u2013 a kg of pigmeat costs less than 2 pence more to produce than in gestation crates.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\n===Sow breeding systems===\nOrganized campaigns by animal activists have focused on the use of the gestation crate, such as the 'gestation crate' and farrowing crate. The gestation crate has now been banned in the UK, certain US states, and other European countries, although it remains part of pig production in much of the US and European Union.\n\nThe sows selected for breeding will be confined in a gestation crate. Hogs (males) are kept confined in caged crates of the same size for the duration of their lives in order to have their sperm repeatedly extracted by workers. In an intensive system, the sow will be placed in a crate prior to insemination and will stay there for at least the start of her pregnancy, depending on each country's laws and local regulations. The typical length of the sow's pregnancy is 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days. In certain cases, sows may spend this time in the crate. However, a variety of farming systems are used and the time in the crate may vary from 4 weeks to the whole pregnancy.\n\nThere is also current controversy and criticism of 'farrowing crates'. A farrowing crate houses the sow in one section and her piglets in another. It allows the sow to lie down and roll over to feed her piglets, but keeps her piglets in a separate section. This prevents the large sow from sitting on her piglets and killing them, which is quite common where the sow is not separated from the piglets.<ref>[http://www.livestocktrail.illinois.edu/swinerepronet/paperDisplay.cfm?ContentID=6266 \u201cPiglet Losses,\u201d] University of Illinois Extension, November 5, 2003.</ref> Sows are also prevented from being able to move other than between standing and lying. Some models of farrowing crates may allow more space than others, and allow greater interaction between sow and young. Well-designed farrowing pens in which the sow has ample space can be just as effective as crates in preventing piglet mortality.<ref name=ciwf08/> Some crates may also be designed with cost-effectiveness or efficiency in mind and therefore be smaller.\n\nAuthoritative industry data indicate that moving from sow stalls to group housing added 2 pence to the cost of producing 1&nbsp;kg. of pigmeat.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\nMany English fattening pigs are kept in barren conditions and are routinely tail docked. Since 2003 EU legislation has required pigs to be given environmental enrichment and has banned routine tail docking. However, 80% of UK pigs are tail docked.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\nIn 2015, use of sow crates was made illegal on New Zealand pig farms.<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10691325\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10691325&ref=facebookheadlines |title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 |date=1 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on traditional rural communities===\nCommon criticism of intensive piggeries is that they represent a corporatization of the traditional rural lifestyle. Critics feel the rise of intensive piggeries has largely replaced family farming. Between 1982 and 1987 some 21% of [[Iowa]] hog farmers went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} By 1992, another 12% had gone out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In large part, this is because intensive piggeries are more economical than outdoor systems, pen systems, or the [[sty]]. In many pork-producing countries (e.g., [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Denmark]]) the use of intensive piggeries has led to market rationalization and concentration. ''The New York Times'' reported that keeping pigs and other animals in \"unnaturally overcrowded\" environments poses considerable health risks for workers, neighbors, and consumers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/books/20book.html|title=You Know That Chicken Is Chicken, Right?|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=20 November 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=28 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Waste management and public health concerns===\nContaminants from animal wastes can enter the environment through pathways such as through leakage of poorly constructed manure lagoons or during major precipitation events resulting in either overflow of lagoons and runoff from recent applications of waste to farm fields, or atmospheric deposition followed by dry or wet fallout. Runoff can leach through permeable soils to vulnerable aquifers that tap ground water sources for human consumption. Runoff of manure can also find its way into surface water such as lakes, streams, and ponds.

The [[enviropig]] is a genetically modified type of pig with the capability to digest plant phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary pigs, though the enviropig program ended in 2012 and did not reach commercial distribution.\n\nNutrient-rich runoff from CAFO's can contribute to [[Algal bloom]]s in rivers, lakes and seas.

The industry's shift from family-owned hog farms to factory hogging has contributed to the frequent targeting of these areas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wimberley, Ronald C., Morris, Libbly V. |title=The Southern Black Belt : A National Perspective |publisher=University of Kentucky |location=Lexington |year=1997 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThis swine production and pollution that accompanies factory hogging is concentrated in the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development.<ref>Raine J. Environmental Justice Issues of the North Carolina Swine Industry [Masters thesis]. Durham, NC:Duke University, Nicholas School of the Environment, 1998.</ref> Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO is made up of three parts: the hog house, the \u201clagoon,\u201d and the \u201cspray field.\u201d Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as [[fertilizer]] for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious [[sludge]] into North Carolina's [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.<ref>Orlando, Laura.

These operations are known as [[Animal feeding operation|AFO]] or [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation|CAFO]] in the U.S. In this system of pig production, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are housed in [[gestation crate]]s or pens and give birth in farrowing crates.\n\nThe use of gestation crates for pregnant sows has resulted in lower birth production costs; however, this practice has led to more significant [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]]. Many of the world's largest producers of pigs ([[United States|US]], [[China]], [[Mexico]]) use gestation crates but some nations and nine US states have banned and removed these crates.

Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death.

Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills. Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group in age groups. Larger swine operations use slotted floors for waste removal, and deliver bulk feed into feeders in each pen; feed is available ad libitum.\n\nPigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]). Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[vitamins]] and [[Subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine|antibiotic]]s are administered preemptively.\n\nIndoor systems allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a [[anaerobic lagoon|lagoon system]] or other waste-management system. However, waste smell remains a problem which is difficult to manage.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://asae.frymulti.com/abstract.asp?aid=15521&t=2 |title=Spatial Variability Of Odor Emissions From Anaerobic Piggery Lagoons In Queensland |author1=G.

Such systems usually refer not to a group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems. Those that support outdoor systems usually do so on the grounds that they are more animal friendly and allow pigs to experience natural activities (e.g., wallowing in mud, relating to young, rooting soil). Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.) They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as [[denitrification]] of soil<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/agro/pdf/2002/07/19.pdf|title=The fate of nitrogen in outdoor pig production|website=Edpsciences.org|accessdate=28 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831180921/http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/agro/pdf/2002/07/19.pdf|archive-date=31 August 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625192517/http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ea/03Projects/32gamle/_2002/pig%20farming.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> and erosion.

Some breeds of pig commonly used in intensive farming have been selectively bred to suit intensive conditions. Lean pink-pigmented pigs are unsuited for outdoor agriculture, as they suffer sunburn and heat stress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In certain environmental conditions \u2013 for example, a temperate climate \u2013 outdoor pig farming of these breeds is possible. However, there are many other breeds of pig suited to outdoor rearing, as they have been used in this way for centuries, such as [[Gloucester Old Spot]] and [[Oxford Forest]]. Following the UK ban of sow stalls, the British Pig Executive indicates that the pig farming industry in the UK has declined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpex.org/technical/general/pdf/marketupdate-sept05.pdf|title=British Pig Executive market update September 2005|website=Bpex.org|accessdate=28 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227150253/http://www.bpex.org/technical/general/pdf/marketupdate-sept05.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The increase in production costs<ref>[http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/another-move-away-pork-crates-/25/59594 \"Another Move Away from Pork Crates,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725210103/http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/another-move-away-pork-crates-/25/59594 |date=2012-07-25 }} Farm Futures, May 8, 2012.</ref> has led to British pig-products being more expensive than those from other countries, leading to increased imports and the need to position UK pork as a product deserving a price premium.\n\nIn 1997, [[Grampian Country Foods]], then the UK's largest pig producer, pointed out that pigmeat production costs in the UK were 44 p/kg higher than on the continent. Grampian stated that only 2 p/kg of this was due to the ban on stalls; the majority of the extra costs resulted from the then strength of sterling and the fact that at that time meat and bone meal had been banned in the UK but not on the continent. A study by the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1999, the year that the gestation crate ban came into force, found that moving from gestation crates, to group housing added just 1.6 pence to the cost of producing 1&nbsp;kg of pigmeat. French and Dutch studies show that even in the higher welfare group housing systems \u2013 ones giving more space and straw \u2013 a kg of pigmeat costs less than 2 pence more to produce than in gestation crates.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\n===Sow breeding systems===\nOrganized campaigns by animal activists have focused on the use of the gestation crate, such as the 'gestation crate' and farrowing crate. The gestation crate has now been banned in the UK, certain US states, and other European countries, although it remains part of pig production in much of the US and European Union.\n\nThe sows selected for breeding will be confined in a gestation crate. Hogs (males) are kept confined in caged crates of the same size for the duration of their lives in order to have their sperm repeatedly extracted by workers. In an intensive system, the sow will be placed in a crate prior to insemination and will stay there for at least the start of her pregnancy, depending on each country's laws and local regulations. The typical length of the sow's pregnancy is 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days. In certain cases, sows may spend this time in the crate. However, a variety of farming systems are used and the time in the crate may vary from 4 weeks to the whole pregnancy.\n\nThere is also current controversy and criticism of 'farrowing crates'. A farrowing crate houses the sow in one section and her piglets in another. It allows the sow to lie down and roll over to feed her piglets, but keeps her piglets in a separate section. This prevents the large sow from sitting on her piglets and killing them, which is quite common where the sow is not separated from the piglets.<ref>[http://www.livestocktrail.illinois.edu/swinerepronet/paperDisplay.cfm?ContentID=6266 \u201cPiglet Losses,\u201d] University of Illinois Extension, November 5, 2003.</ref> Sows are also prevented from being able to move other than between standing and lying. Some models of farrowing crates may allow more space than others, and allow greater interaction between sow and young. Well-designed farrowing pens in which the sow has ample space can be just as effective as crates in preventing piglet mortality.<ref name=ciwf08/> Some crates may also be designed with cost-effectiveness or efficiency in mind and therefore be smaller.\n\nAuthoritative industry data indicate that moving from sow stalls to group housing added 2 pence to the cost of producing 1&nbsp;kg. of pigmeat.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\nMany English fattening pigs are kept in barren conditions and are routinely tail docked. Since 2003 EU legislation has required pigs to be given environmental enrichment and has banned routine tail docking. However, 80% of UK pigs are tail docked.<ref name=ciwf08/>\n\nIn 2015, use of sow crates was made illegal on New Zealand pig farms.<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10691325\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10691325&ref=facebookheadlines |title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 |date=1 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on traditional rural communities===\nCommon criticism of intensive piggeries is that they represent a corporatization of the traditional rural lifestyle. Critics feel the rise of intensive piggeries has largely replaced family farming. Between 1982 and 1987 some 21% of [[Iowa]] hog farmers went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} By 1992, another 12% had gone out of business.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In large part, this is because intensive piggeries are more economical than outdoor systems, pen systems, or the [[sty]]. In many pork-producing countries (e.g., [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Denmark]]) the use of intensive piggeries has led to market rationalization and concentration. ''The New York Times'' reported that keeping pigs and other animals in \"unnaturally overcrowded\" environments poses considerable health risks for workers, neighbors, and consumers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/books/20book.html|title=You Know That Chicken Is Chicken, Right?|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=20 November 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=28 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Waste management and public health concerns===\nContaminants from animal wastes can enter the environment through pathways such as through leakage of poorly constructed manure lagoons or during major precipitation events resulting in either overflow of lagoons and runoff from recent applications of waste to farm fields, or atmospheric deposition followed by dry or wet fallout. Runoff can leach through permeable soils to vulnerable aquifers that tap ground water sources for human consumption. Runoff of manure can also find its way into surface water such as lakes, streams, and ponds. An example of weather induced runoff having been recently reported in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/10/16/factory-farming-practices-are-under-scrutiny-again-in-n-c-after-disastrous-hurricane-floods/|title=Factory farming practices are under scrutiny again in N.C. after disastrous hurricane floods|first1=Arelis R.

Improper disposal of animal carcasses and abandoned livestock facilities can also contribute to water quality problems in surrounding areas of CAFOs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nExposure to waterborne contaminants can result from both recreational use of affected surface water and from ingestion of drinking water derived from either contaminated surface water or ground water. High-Risk populations are generally the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. Dermal contact may cause skin, eye, or ear infections. Drinking water exposures to pathogens could occur in vulnerable private wells.<ref>Burkholder JoAnn; Bob Libra, Peter Weyer, Susan Heathcote, Dana Kolpin, Peter S.

The [[enviropig]] is a genetically modified type of pig with the capability to digest plant phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary pigs, though the enviropig program ended in 2012 and did not reach commercial distribution.\n\nNutrient-rich runoff from CAFO's can contribute to [[Algal bloom]]s in rivers, lakes and seas. The 2009 [[Harmful Algal Bloom]] event off the coast of [[Brittany|Brittany, France]] was attributed to runoff from an intensive pig farm.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Lethal algae take over beaches in northern France|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/france-brittany-coast-seaweed-algae|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===North Carolina===\nAs of 2010, North Carolina housed approximately ten million hogs, most of which are located in the eastern half of the state in industrialized [[CAFO]]s or Confined Animal Feeding Operations. This was not the case twenty years ago. The initial [[horizontal integration]] and the [[vertical integration]] that arose in this industry resulted in numerous issues, including issues of environmental disparity, loss of work, [[pollution]], [[animal rights]], and overall general public health. The most remarkable example of swine CAFO monopoly is found in the United States, where in 2001, 50 producers had control over 70% of total pork production. In 2001, the biggest CAFO had just over 710,000 [[Pig|sows]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.engormix.com/MA-pig-industry/management/articles/swine-production-global-perspective-t336/124-p0.htm|title=Swine production: a global perspective|website=En.engormix.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Murphy Family Farms [[Horizontal integration|horizontally integrated]] the North Carolina system.

The industry's shift from family-owned hog farms to factory hogging has contributed to the frequent targeting of these areas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wimberley, Ronald C., Morris, Libbly V. |title=The Southern Black Belt : A National Perspective |publisher=University of Kentucky |location=Lexington |year=1997 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThis swine production and pollution that accompanies factory hogging is concentrated in the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development.<ref>Raine J. Environmental Justice Issues of the North Carolina Swine Industry [Masters thesis]. Durham, NC:Duke University, Nicholas School of the Environment, 1998.</ref> Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO is made up of three parts: the hog house, the \u201clagoon,\u201d and the \u201cspray field.\u201d Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as [[fertilizer]] for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious [[sludge]] into North Carolina's [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.<ref>Orlando, Laura. McFarms Go Wild, Dollars and Sense, July/August 1998, cited in Scully, Matthew. Dominion, St. Martin's Griffin, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThe toxins emitted by the swine CAFOs can produce a variety of symptoms and illnesses ranging from respiratory disorders, headaches, and shortness of breath to hydrogen sulfide poisoning, bronchitis, and asthma. The potential for spray field runoff or lagoon leakage puts nearby residents in danger of contaminated drinking water, which can lead to diseases like [[Salmonellosis|samonellosis]], [[giardiasis]], [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[meningitis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[worm]]s, and [[influenza]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Donham K. |chapter=The impact of industrial swine production on human health |veditors=Thu K, Durrenberger E |title=Pigs, Profits, and Rural Communities |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |year=1998 |isbn= |pages=73\u201383 |chapter-url= }}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nSlaughterhouses and veterinarians are obliged to report pigs with injuries to the [[Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries|Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries]], which forwards cases to the police.

Afterward, Garrett was arrested for tax evasion and ended up having an affair with the federal agent who arrested him.

Freidman: ''\"Azad Hind\" and \"Chalo Delhi\" Stamps.'' Jal Cooper, Bombay 1972, p. 12.</ref> 1 million copies of each stamp were printed. Exceptions were those planned for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] without surcharge, which were only issued 500,000 times. A very small number were produced of the higher values 1+2 rupees, which exist in three different varieties. Due to the fact that this value was manufactured in a multicolour print, unfinished variants were discovered later. At the end the flag should be illustrated in orange, white and green colours. Unfinished prints in black and black/orange have been preserved. Of the black version the found quantity was 4500 pieces, of the black-orange 2000 pieces and of the final, finished version 7000 pieces. Except for the higher rupees values (only imperforated), all stamps exist both perforated and in practically the same number imperforated. The stamps planned for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were perforated L 10\u00bd. All other small nominal values were perforated differently, so there were issues with the following variants: L 9\u00bd:10\u00bd, 10\u00bd, 10\u00bd:9\u00bd and 11:10\u00bd. There are often stamps with irregular perforations.\n\nA large part of the 1+2 rupees stamp in black/orange exists only without gum. Of the 1+2 rupees stamp, very rare proofs have survived, including two sheets of proofs with dark purple instead of black tones and one sheet of proofs on cardboard paper with [[Optical brightener|brightener]]. This cardboard was provided with advertising on its reverse side. Moreover there exist proofs that were made on paper dyed orange on the front side. There are rupee stamps on which the colours appear blurred or have been printed in the wrong place (sometimes twice). There is a conspicuous plate error of the 3+3 annas stamp, which partly has a larger white, round spot left of the nurse's head.\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"1+2 rupees stamps (inclusive proofs)\">\nStamp Azad Hind.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange/green (VII a)\nStamp Azad Hind black.jpg|1+2 rupees black<br /> (VII b)\nStamp Azad Hind orange.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange (VII c)\nStamp Azad Hind Orange paper.JPG|Proof on orange coloured paper\nAzad Hind Karton.png|Proof on cardboard paper with optical brightener\nAzad Hind violett.png|Proof with dark purple tones\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Varieties and special features\">\nStamp PF Azad Hind 3a.png|3+3 annas stamp with a striking plate error\nAzad Hind gruen verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted green colour\nAzad Hind orange verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted orange colour\nAzad Hind Sample print back side.png|Reverse side of the proof on cardboard paper\n</gallery>\n\n== Cataloguing and publications ==\n[[File:Stamps Azad Hind Adaptation.png|thumb|180px|A modern design of Azad Hind stamps in a publication of the ''Netaji Birth Place Museum'' (India)]]\nThe stamps of Azad Hind are listed in the [[Michel catalog|Michel Germany catalogue]] under \"Nationales Indien\" (\"National India\") and bear the designations I to X ( perforated and imperforated).

These can usually be recognized by an unclear and washed-out looking print, as they are often produced using [[offset printing]] instead of photogravure. There are also imitations that are produced with [[Inkjet printer|inkjet printers]].\n\nAs the stamps have not been issued, it is not possible that they exist with a real [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]. In 1964 Subhas Chandra Bose was honoured in India by the Indian Post with two stamps. On this occasion [[First day cover|first day covers]] with Bose stamps were also published. On some of these letters, as a \"mixed franking\", Azad Hind stamps were additionally attached and then cancelled.

Exceptions were those planned for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] without surcharge, which were only issued 500,000 times. A very small number were produced of the higher values 1+2 rupees, which exist in three different varieties. Due to the fact that this value was manufactured in a multicolour print, unfinished variants were discovered later. At the end the flag should be illustrated in orange, white and green colours. Unfinished prints in black and black/orange have been preserved. Of the black version the found quantity was 4500 pieces, of the black-orange 2000 pieces and of the final, finished version 7000 pieces. Except for the higher rupees values (only imperforated), all stamps exist both perforated and in practically the same number imperforated. The stamps planned for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were perforated L 10\u00bd. All other small nominal values were perforated differently, so there were issues with the following variants: L 9\u00bd:10\u00bd, 10\u00bd, 10\u00bd:9\u00bd and 11:10\u00bd. There are often stamps with irregular perforations.\n\nA large part of the 1+2 rupees stamp in black/orange exists only without gum. Of the 1+2 rupees stamp, very rare proofs have survived, including two sheets of proofs with dark purple instead of black tones and one sheet of proofs on cardboard paper with [[Optical brightener|brightener]]. This cardboard was provided with advertising on its reverse side. Moreover there exist proofs that were made on paper dyed orange on the front side. There are rupee stamps on which the colours appear blurred or have been printed in the wrong place (sometimes twice).

Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential.

After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Julius Martov]] and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and the \"new guard\" led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov|Martov]]. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\n{{Quote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary.

But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\n\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]] (1882 &ndash; 1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (24 February 1906 \u2013 16 February 1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (21 March 1908 \u2013 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\n{{Quote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.<ref>Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129055537/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html |date=29 November 2005 }}</ref>}}\n\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly.

Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], which had co-founded the [[RSDLP]] in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.<ref name=\":3\">Trotsky, Leon.&nbsp;''My life: an attempt at an autobiography''. Courier Corporation, 2007.</ref>\n\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Menshevik|Mensheviks]], argued for a more massive and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|year=2003|title=The Bolshevik\u2013Menshevik Split|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|journal=History Today|volume=53|number=11|accessdate=22 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175007/http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|archive-date=22 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917, trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party.

Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions, while Plekhanov and other social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent. In [[Switzerland]], Trotsky briefly worked within the [[Swiss Socialist Party]], prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution.

In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) ''[[Nashe Slovo]]'' (\"Our Word\"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of \"peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.\" Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the [[Second International]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Lenin|last=Fischer|first=Louis|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson History|year=2001|isbn=978-1842122303|location=UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\nTrotsky attended the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a [[Third International]].

He stayed for nearly three months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in [[The Bronx]]. In New York he wrote articles for the local [[Russian language]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Novy Mir (1916 magazine)|Novy Mir]],'' and the [[Yiddish]]-language daily, [[The Jewish Daily Forward|''Der Forverts'' (''The Jewish Daily Forward'')]], in translation.

After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]], a regional social democratic organization in [[Saint Petersburg]], and became one of its leaders.

Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other socialist parties. By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading.

Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.<ref name=\"lsrm\" />\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Territory lost under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<ref>The \"Brest-Litovsk\" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; accessed 1 June 2018.</ref>{{Quote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}\n\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories.

Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s, [[Nikolai Krestinsky]]'s and [[Adolph Joffe]]'s) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk.

At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nGermany resumed [[Operation Faustschlag|military operations]] on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7\u20134.

The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight.

Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\n\n=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky Armored Train 1920.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky speaks from the Armoured Train, Russian Civil War in 1920]]\n\nThe failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination. Celebrated and feared [[Baltic Fleet]] sailors, one of the bastions of the new regime led by [[Pavel Dybenko]], fled from the German army at [[Narva]]. The notion that the Soviet state could have a capable voluntary or [[militia]] type military was seriously undermined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nTrotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognize the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on 4 March to create the [[Revolutionary Military Council|Supreme Military Council]], headed by the former chief of the Imperial General Staff [[Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) [[Nikolai Podvoisky]] and commander-in-chief [[Nikolai Krylenko]], protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the [[Military Opposition]] (Russian: [[:ru:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f|\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f]]), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918\u20131919.<ref name=\"Life XXXVI\">{{cite book|title=My Life|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|chapter=XXXVI|year=1930|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch36.htm|title-link=My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs \u2013 in place of Podvoisky \u2013 and chairman of the Supreme Military Council.

In May\u2013June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization|mobilisation]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution.

The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters \u2013 come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.}}\n\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Quote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us!

[[Jukums V\u0101cietis]]), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\n\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled{{by whom|date=February 2014}} from the front. Lenin and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\n\n==== 1919 ====\n[[File:\u041b. \u0414 . \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0435. 1919.jpg|right|thumb|Trotsky at a rally dedicated to the funeral of the victims of the explosion in Leontievsky lane (1919).]]\n[[File:Trotsky con la guardia roja.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Trotsky addressing soldiers of the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War.]]\n[[File:Trotsky on a Polish poster of 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|A Polish poster depicts Trotsky on a pile of skulls and holding a bloody knife, during the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1920]]\n\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIIIth Party Congress]] in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first [[Politburo]] after the Congress.

It was about to cross the [[Ural Mountains]] and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces. But in the south, General [[Anton Denikin]]'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]], ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander [[Sergey Kamenev]] (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members [[Ivar Smilga]], [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front. Trotsky, who had earlier had conflicts with the leadership of the Eastern Front, including a temporary removal of Kamenev in May 1919, supported V\u0101cietis.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAt the 3\u20134 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against V\u0101cietis and Trotsky.

Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, V\u0101cietis was suddenly arrested by the [[Cheka]] on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and then supported during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<ref>Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226084149/http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt |date=26 February 2006 }} re: the Smilga episode.

Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch35.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXV)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch35.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref> that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]] from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his actions in Petrograd.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n====1920====\n[[File:B\u00e9la Kun, Jacques Sadoul, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze, Sergey Gusev 1920.jpg|left|thumb|[[B\u00e9la Kun]], [[Jacques Sadoul (politician)|Jacques Sadoul]], Leon Trotsky, [[Mikhail Frunze]] and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergey Gusev]].

Trotsky spent the winter of 1919\u201320 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of [[War Communism]],<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXVIII)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210202136/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm |date=10 December 2005 }}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref> which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal. He put Trotsky in charge of the country's railroads (while retaining overall control of the Red Army), which he directed should be militarized in the spirit of War Communism. It was not until early 1921, due to economic collapse and social uprisings, that Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership abandoned War Communism in favor of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Kalinin Trotsky Polish\u2013Soviet War.jpg|riht|thumb|[[Mikhail Kalinin]] and Leon Trotsky greet [[Red Army]] troops.

In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued<ref name=\"My Life\" /> that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper.

Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\n\n===Trade union debate (1920\u20131921)===\n\nIn late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of [[trade unions in the Soviet Union]]. The discussion split the party into many \"platforms\" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the [[Workers' Opposition]] (headed by [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]) and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] were particularly active.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: <blockquote>\"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime.

He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\n\n[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]\n\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] and [[Leonid Serebryakov]]) supporting Trotsky.\n\nAt a meeting of his faction at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents. At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm \"More on the Suppression of Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref>\n\nYears later, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] and others criticised Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm \"Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073043/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | first=Emma | last=Goldman | title=Trotsky Protests too Much | date=1938 | publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation | location=Glasgow | via=UC Berkeley Library | accessdate=14 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118090914/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | archive-date=18 January 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some Trotskyists, most notably [[Abbie Bakan]], have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion.<ref>[[Abbie Bakan]].

He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919.

New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee.

Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\n\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).<ref>Document 103 (22 May 1922) in ''The Unknown Lenin''</ref> In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\".

Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\n\nIn mid-1923 the ''troika'' had Trotsky's friend and supporter [[Christian Rakovsky]] removed from his post as head of the Ukrainian government ([[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|USSR ''Radnarkom'']]) and sent to London as ambassador. When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Left opposition (1923\u20131924) ===\n{{main|Left Opposition}} \n[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Trotsky in a 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] \u2013 a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]\n\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"[[Workers' Truth]]\" and \"[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{Quote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.<ref>Leon Trotsky, \"The First Letter to the Central Committee\" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55\u201356.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>}}\n\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\n\n{{Quote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}\n\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''troika'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"<ref>Quoted in Max Shachtman.

The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16\u201318 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the [[Left Opposition]].<ref name=\"lom\">[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition Left Opposition ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716012705/https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition#left-opposition |date=16 July 2018 }}; Glossary of organizations on [[Marxists.org]]</ref>\n[[File:Bolsheviks writing a Repy to Englishman Curzon.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky with Soviet leaders write the letter of defiance to [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]], UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1923, a parody of [[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]]]\nSince the ''troika'' controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and ''Pravda'' through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"{{efn|The term \"Trotskyism\" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the ''troika'' was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's \"mistakes\" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===After Lenin's death (1924)===\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\n\nAt the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<ref>Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430065533/http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm |date=30 April 2006 }}<!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\n{{Quote|None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party.

It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program.\n\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the ''troika'' at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '[[Socialism in One Country]]'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\n\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''<ref>Leon Trotsky \"Lessons of October\" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'', pp. 199\u2013258.</ref> an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\n\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\n\n* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\n* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\n* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\n\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\n\n===A year in the wilderness (1925)===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] of the Soviet Union in May 1925]]\n\n1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts:  chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry.

The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used [[party discipline]] to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIV Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky addresses the meeting in the [[House of the Unions]] in March 1926]]\n\n=== United Opposition (1926\u20131927) ===\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition]].\n\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\n\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the \"History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n{{check quotation}}\nIn reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J.

Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.\n\n<br />\n\n===Defeat and exile (1927\u20131928)===\nIn October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XV Party Congress]], which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]], in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to [[Turkey]] in February 1929, accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and their eldest son, [[Lev Sedov|Lev]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Joshua |title=Leon Trotsky: a revolutionary's life |year=2011 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300137248 |pages=155\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929\u20131941)===\n[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: \"On the service of bourgeoisie\"]]\n\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the [[Soviet Union]], and was exiled to [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] in March 1933.

Trotsky's grave is located on its grounds. The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.\n\nTrotsky was never formally [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the [[Glasnost]]-era rehabilitation of most other [[Old Bolshevik|Old Bolsheviks]] killed during the Great Purges. His son, [[Sergei Sedov]], who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\n\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|General Prosecutor's Office]] (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").<ref>[http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html \u0412. \u0412. \u0418\u043e\u0444\u0435. \u041e\u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821184248/http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html |date=21 August 2011 }} \u041d\u0418\u0426 \u00ab\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u00bb</ref>\n\nIn the allegorical novel [[Animal Farm]] by [[George Orwell]] based on the [[Russian Revolution]], Trotsky is portrayed by the character Snowball, a pig.\n\n==Contributions to theory==\n{{Main|Trotskyism}}\n\nTrotsky considered himself a \"Bolshevik-Leninist,\" arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]]. He viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox Marxism.<ref>Michael Cox, \"Trotsky and his interpreters; or, will the real Leon Trotsky please stand up?\" ''Russian Review''  51#1 (1992) pp 84+.</ref>\n\nHis politics differed in some respects from those of Stalin or [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in his rejection of the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] and his declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]].\" Numerous [[Fourth International|Fourth Internationalist]] groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition. However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating [[political revolution]], and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.<ref>Erik Van Ree, \"Socialism in One Country: A Reassessment\" ''Studies in East European Thought'' 50#2 (1998) pp 77-117.</ref>\n\n=== Permanent Revolution ===\n{{Main|Permanent revolution}}\n[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural depicts Trotsky with [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] as a true champion of the workers' struggle]]\n\nPermanent Revolution is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:\n\n{{Quote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far \u2013 not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world \u2013 that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: '''The Permanent Revolution'''.}}\n\nTrotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904\u20131905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905''and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"[[Results and Prospects]].\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the [[Third World]] shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editorial Board|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529173202/http://wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|archive-date=29 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===The United Front===\n{{Main|United Front}}\nTrotsky was a central figure in the [[Comintern]] during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the [[united front]], a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\n\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party in]] [[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]], his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.<ref>Joseph Choonara, [http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 \"The United Front\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107230355/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 |date=7 January 2008 }}, ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'', 117</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal||Politics|Philosophy|History|Russia|Ukraine|Soviet Union|Mexico|Communism|Socialism|Religion}}\n* [[Fourth International]]\n* [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Group of Democratic Centralism]]\n* [[Labor army]]\n* [[List of books by Leon Trotsky]]\n* [[List of Trotskyist internationals]]\n* [[List of Trotskyist organizations by country]]\n* ''[[Frida]]'', 2002 film\n* ''[[Variations on the Death of Trotsky]]'', 1991 play\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Blackledge|date=2006|title=Leon Trotsky's Contribution to the Marxist Theory of History|journal=Studies in East European Thought|volume=58|issue= 1|pages=1\u201331|doi=10.1007/s11212-005-3677-z|ref=1\u201331}}\n* {{cite book|first=Tony|last=Cliff|date=1989\u201393|title=Trotsky|volume=4 Vols.|place=London|publisher= Bookmarks|ref=harv}}\n* Cox, Michael. \"Trotsky and His Interpreters; or, Will the Real Leon Trotsky Please Stand up?\" ''Russian Review'' 51#1, (1992), pp.&nbsp;84\u2013102 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/131248 online]\n* {{cite book|author=Isaac Deutscher|title=Trotsky: The Prophet Armed|date=1954|ref=harv|author-link=Isaac Deutscher}} [https://archive.org/details/prophetarmedtrot00deut online free to borrow]\n* Isaac Deutscher:\n** (1959) ''Trotsky: The Prophet Unarmed''\n** (1963) ''Trotsky: The Prophet Outcast''\n* Isaac Deutscher (1966) ''Ironies of History''.\n* Daniels, Robert V (1991) ''Trotsky, Stalin & Socialism''.

Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' (''The Spark,'') which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the ''Iskra'' position and began writing for the paper.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1965) pg. 67.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879\u20131921'', pg. 55.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2018}} Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents.

After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Julius Martov]] and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and the \"new guard\" led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov|Martov]]. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\n{{Quote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.<ref>Quoted in chapter XII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm 'My Life'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121230553/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm |date=21 November 2005 }}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\n\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]] (1882 &ndash; 1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (24 February 1906 \u2013 16 February 1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (21 March 1908 \u2013 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\n{{Quote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.<ref>Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129055537/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html |date=29 November 2005 }}</ref>}}\n\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\n\n===Split with Lenin (1903\u20131904)===\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898, ''Iskra'' succeeded in convening the party's [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], which had co-founded the [[RSDLP]] in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.<ref name=\":3\">Trotsky, Leon.&nbsp;''My life: an attempt at an autobiography''. Courier Corporation, 2007.</ref>\n\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Menshevik|Mensheviks]], argued for a more massive and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]].

Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<ref>The \"Brest-Litovsk\" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; accessed 1 June 2018.</ref>{{Quote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}\n\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories.

Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s, [[Nikolai Krestinsky]]'s and [[Adolph Joffe]]'s) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk.

At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nGermany resumed [[Operation Faustschlag|military operations]] on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7\u20134.

The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight.

Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\n\n=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky Armored Train 1920.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky speaks from the Armoured Train, Russian Civil War in 1920]]\n\nThe failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination.

The notion that the Soviet state could have a capable voluntary or [[militia]] type military was seriously undermined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nTrotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognize the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on 4 March to create the [[Revolutionary Military Council|Supreme Military Council]], headed by the former chief of the Imperial General Staff [[Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) [[Nikolai Podvoisky]] and commander-in-chief [[Nikolai Krylenko]], protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the [[Military Opposition]] (Russian: [[:ru:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f|\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f]]), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918\u20131919.<ref name=\"Life XXXVI\">{{cite book|title=My Life|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|chapter=XXXVI|year=1930|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch36.htm|title-link=My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs \u2013 in place of Podvoisky \u2013 and chairman of the Supreme Military Council.

In May\u2013June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization|mobilisation]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution.

The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters \u2013 come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.}}\n\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Quote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us!

The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the [[Latvian Riflemen]], [[Ioakim Vatsetis|Loakim Vatsetis]] (a.k.a. [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]]), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\n\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled{{by whom|date=February 2014}} from the front.

It was about to cross the [[Ural Mountains]] and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces. But in the south, General [[Anton Denikin]]'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]], ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander [[Sergey Kamenev]] (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members [[Ivar Smilga]], [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front.

Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, V\u0101cietis was suddenly arrested by the [[Cheka]] on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and then supported during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<ref>Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226084149/http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt |date=26 February 2006 }} re: the Smilga episode.

He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned.

The discussion split the party into many \"platforms\" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the [[Workers' Opposition]] (headed by [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]) and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] were particularly active.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: <blockquote>\"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\"<ref>[[Tony Cliff]]; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html Trotsky: The Sword of the Revolution 1917-1923] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715195155/https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html |date=15 July 2018 }}; Chapter 11: War Communism at an impasse; paragraph \"The militarisation of all labour\"; Bookmarks, London 1990</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Lenin, Trotsky and Voroshilov with Delegates of the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Klim Voroshilov]] among soldiers in [[Petrograd]] in 1921.]]\n\nLenin sharply criticized Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks.\" His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\n\n[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]\n\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] and [[Leonid Serebryakov]]) supporting Trotsky.\n\nAt a meeting of his faction at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents. At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm \"More on the Suppression of Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref>\n\nYears later, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] and others criticised Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm \"Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073043/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} by Leon Trotsky</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | first=Emma | last=Goldman | title=Trotsky Protests too Much | date=1938 | publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation | location=Glasgow | via=UC Berkeley Library | accessdate=14 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118090914/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | archive-date=18 January 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some Trotskyists, most notably [[Abbie Bakan]], have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion.<ref>[[Abbie Bakan]].

He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919. He was replaced by [[Elena Stasova]], and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.\n\nAfter Krestinsky's ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky's authority, since he was not a full Politburo member.

Stalin's power of patronage{{efn|The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country's ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary's hands.}} in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\n\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).<ref>Document 103 (22 May 1922) in ''The Unknown Lenin''</ref> In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\".

If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????}}\n\nFrom then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in ''[[Lenin's Testament]].'' As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\".<ref>Document 109 in ''The Unknown Lenin''.</ref>\n\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy.<ref>Chapter XXXIX of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch39.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212213/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch39.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref> Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), further centralising state control.

The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIIth Party Congress]].\n\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.<ref>Chapter 11 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051005/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html |date=29 June 2007 }}</ref> Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the ''troika.''{{efn|Trotsky explained in Chapter 12 of his unfinished book [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] that he refused to deliver the report because \"it seemed to me equivalent to announcing my candidacy for the role of Lenin's successor at a time when Lenin was fighting a grave illness.}} Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.<ref>Chapter 12 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712104730/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html |date=12 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a [[standing ovation]].

When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Left opposition (1923\u20131924) ===\n{{main|Left Opposition}} \n[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Trotsky in a 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] \u2013 a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]\n\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"[[Workers' Truth]]\" and \"[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{Quote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization.

[...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.<ref>Leon Trotsky, \"The First Letter to the Central Committee\" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55\u201356.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>}}\n\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\n\n{{Quote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life.

[...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}\n\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''troika'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"<ref>Quoted in Max Shachtman.

Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"{{efn|The term \"Trotskyism\" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the ''troika'' was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's \"mistakes\" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===After Lenin's death (1924)===\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\n\nAt the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<ref>Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430065533/http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm |date=30 April 2006 }}<!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\n{{Quote|None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party.

It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program.\n\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the ''troika'' at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '[[Socialism in One Country]]'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\n\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''<ref>Leon Trotsky \"Lessons of October\" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923\u20131925'', pp. 199\u2013258.</ref> an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\n\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\n\n* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\n* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\n* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\n\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\n\n===A year in the wilderness (1925)===\n[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] of the Soviet Union in May 1925]]\n\n1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts:  chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in ''My Life''<ref name=\":5\">Chapter 22 of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212234/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}</ref> that he \"was taking a rest from politics\" and \"naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\".<ref>Leon Trotsky, ''My Life'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1970) p. 520.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man.<ref>Nikolai Valentinov-Volsky's account of his work with Trotsky in 1925 in ''Novaia Ekonomicheskaia Politika i Krizis Partii Posle Smerti Lenina: Gody Raboty v VSNKh vo Vremia NEP'', Moscow, Sovremennik, 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist [[Max Eastman]] in his book ''Since Lenin Died'' (1925). The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used [[party discipline]] to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIV Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky addresses the meeting in the [[House of the Unions]] in March 1926]]\n\n=== United Opposition (1926\u20131927) ===\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition]].\n\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\n\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the \"History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n{{check quotation}}\nIn reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" \u2014 the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, \"The Prospects of Revolution in China\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\" contained in ''J.

Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.\n\n<br />\n\n===Defeat and exile (1927\u20131928)===\nIn October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XV Party Congress]], which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]], in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to [[Turkey]] in February 1929, accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and their eldest son, [[Lev Sedov|Lev]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Joshua |title=Leon Trotsky: a revolutionary's life |year=2011 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300137248 |pages=155\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929\u20131941)===\n[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: \"On the service of bourgeoisie\"]]\n\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the [[Soviet Union]], and was exiled to [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist [[Jean Van Heijenoort]], together with his fellow activist [[Pierre Frank]], unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul.<ref name=\"yedlin\">Tova Yedlin, ''Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography'', Praeger/Greenwood, [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], 1992, p.201-202. {{ISBN|978-0-275-96605-8}}</ref> According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.<ref name=\"yedlin\"/> Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" (his letter to ''[[Pravda]]'', titled ''There Should Be No Mercy'', depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German [[Gestapo]]\").<ref>Medvedev, p.169</ref> Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">Feofanov & Barry, p. 22</ref> However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of [[Sergey Kirov]], and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the [[Great Purge]].<ref name=\"faganoppexile\">Fagan, Gus; Biographical Introduction to Christian Rakovsky; chapter ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm Opposition and Exile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715212757/https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm |date=15 July 2018 }}''</ref>\n\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the [[Great Purge]]s of 1936\u20131938, although Rakovsky survived until the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]] of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]].

Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:\n\n{{Quote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far \u2013 not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world \u2013 that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: '''The Permanent Revolution'''.}}\n\nTrotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904\u20131905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905''and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"[[Results and Prospects]].\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the [[Third World]] shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editorial Board|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529173202/http://wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|archive-date=29 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===The United Front===\n{{Main|United Front}}\nTrotsky was a central figure in the [[Comintern]] during its first four congresses.

He wanted a place where individuals and organizations could meet in a distraction-free, neutral environment to openly exchange ideas and share opinions on important matters of the day. The purpose, of course, was to ignite thought and inspire collective action. / The development of Dr. Head's vision was a success. He integrated modern meeting facilities and accommodations with the lush, natural setting of the Airlie estate. In 1961, [[Airlie Center]] opened its doors and Life Magazine declared it an innovative \"Island of Thought.\" / With this innovative platform, Dr. Head initiated a variety of programs dedicated to education, environmental research, public health, and social progress.

Groome rebuilt the house on its original foundation, but reduced it from three to two stories. / When Dr. Head purchased Airlie Farm in 1956, he laid down the foundation for the course of the structure for the next 50 years. Dr. Head had a vision of creating one of the first conference facilities of its kind in the country. He wanted a place where individuals and organizations could meet in a distraction-free, neutral environment to openly exchange ideas and share opinions on important matters of the day. The purpose, of course, was to ignite thought and inspire collective action. / The development of Dr. Head's vision was a success. He integrated modern meeting facilities and accommodations with the lush, natural setting of the Airlie estate. In 1961, [[Airlie Center]] opened its doors and Life Magazine declared it an innovative \"Island of Thought.\" / With this innovative platform, Dr. Head initiated a variety of programs dedicated to education, environmental research, public health, and social progress. During the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Head established [[Airlie Center]] as a safe zone for dialogue. [[Airlie Productions]], Dr. Head's studio facilities based at Airlie Center, created hundreds of documentaries on the full spectrum of social and environmental issues and received more than 20 Emmy awards recognizing 20 years of work. / Today, Airlie remains committed to its founding ideals of environmental stewardship and the open exchange of ideas in a distraction-free setting. / Airlie, a member of Historic Hotels of America since 2015, dates back to 1899.\"\n*[[Williamsburg Inn]], Williamsburg, Virginia\n*[[Williamsburg Lodge, Autograph Collection, and Colonial Houses]], Williamsburg, Virginia\n\n==Washington==\n*[[Mayflower Park Hotel]] (1927), Seattle, Washington.
