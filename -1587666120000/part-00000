Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of valuable{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} commodities.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} and China{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} where there are abundant coal resources.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=April 18, 2020|date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); ''Bob\u2019s Burgers'' is consistently amusing; and even ''Family Guy'', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But ''Bless The Harts'' is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from ''King of the Hill'', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented ''Son of Zorn'' (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as ''Bless The Harts'') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=April 18, 2020|date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. ''The Simpsons'' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); ''Bob\u2019s Burgers'' is consistently amusing; and even ''Family Guy'', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But ''Bless The Harts'' is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from ''King of the Hill'', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented ''Son of Zorn'' (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as ''Bless The Harts'') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'

{"title_page": "Women in the Protestant Reformation", "text_new": "The status of '''women in the [[Protestant Reformation]]''' was the role of [[wife]] and [[mother]], just as the men's role was that of husband, father, or son. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Gender roles== \n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Marriage===\nA wife was expected to be a companion to her other wife, but she was always her subordine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Obedience was demanded by husbands, and women were restricted in their actions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\nThere were some women during the Reformation who were not as restricted as other women. [[Katharina von Bora]] who married the well known reformer Martin Luther set the standard of more roles given to a pastor's wife. She was also considered to be a horrible role model for those women who, like herself, had also dated into the clergy.\n\n[[Elisabeth of Hesse, Hereditary Princess of Saxony|Elisabeth of Hesse]] exposed the secret bigamy of her brother [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip]].\n\n===Education and domestic work===\nWomen were to be silent, obedient, and to perform household tasks, but this could vary considerably depending on social class and wealth. For example, commoner [[Kaarina Multiala]] (d. between 1563-1571) owned several ships and was a wealthy Finnish merchant. Another commoner, [[Brigitta Lars Anderssons]] (d. after 1551) was a folk healer who became the personal physician and nurse to the queen. Also, in 1572 Danish scientist [[Sophia Brahe]] (1556\u20131643) assisted her brother [[Tycho Brahe|Tycho]] with his astronomical observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe|publisher=National Schools' Observatory|accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=}}</ref> Also, [[Constantia Zierenberg]] (1605\u20131653) was a Calvinist daughter of a mayor. She was fluent in six languages and sang for royalty. The purpose of women's education was the development of an accepted concept of marriage and training in [[Home economics|domestic skills]], although Calvinist [[Anne Locke]] was a translator and poet who published the first English sonnet sequence. Women were taught how to look after children, care for their homes, make clothing for her family, and [[Animal husbandry|tend]] livestock. [[Anna Karlsdotter]] (d. 1552) was a noblewoman who retracted donations her ancestors had made to a church and died wealthy. Also, [[Countess Emilie Juliane of Barby-M\u00fchlingen|Countess Emilie Juliane]] (1637\u20131706) was educated in religion, Latin, history, and other subjects,<ref name=\"Koldau\">{{cite book \n| last = Koldau\n| first = Linda Maria\n| url = https://books.google.de/books?id=QmkQScqES9UC&pg=PA281\n| title = Frauen-Musik-Kultur: ein Handbuch zum deutschen Sprachgebiet der Fr\u00fchen Neuzeit\n| publisher = B\u00f6hlau Verlag\n| year = 2005\n| isbn = 3-64-756402-8\n| language = German\n| pages = 281\u2013286\n}}</ref> and went on to write 587 hymns that survive to the present day. The change was that women were now encouraged to study the Bible in vernacular language, to be a biblical influence for children and with their husband. By allowing women to become educated and read the bible, they found passages suggesting women were equal to men in the presence of God. The [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571|Swedish Church Ordinance of 1571]] mandated the education of girls along with the boys. [[Anna Taskomakare]] (c. 1480 - d. after 1528) was a successful and wealthy landlady who also traded copper and iron.\n\nBecause [[Elizabeth I of England]] was a woman, Parliament decided to make her the ''Supreme Governor of the Church of England'' instead of the ''Supreme Head of the Church of England''. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] she played a role in cultivating developed into the Protestant Church of England that exists today.\n\n\u00b0==Ecclesiastical status==\n===Women not allowed to preach or publish===\n[[Elisabeth Cruciger]] was a friend of Martin Luther and the first female Reformation-era hymn writer. [[Elizabeth Melville]] was the first woman to print a book in Scotland. Women's preaching or publishing material stood in direct opposition to the words ascribed to St. Paul (1 Timothy 2: 11-15) which ordered women not to teach or preach, so that all women who published felt it necessary to justify their actions.<ref>, Wiesner, Merry E., \"The Reformation of the Women,\" 148-149</ref> Even the sole alternative role for women which had existed outside of marriage, to join a convent, was no longer available in Reformed Protestant areas, although some convents voluntarily participated in the Reformation. For example, following [[Catherine of Mecklenburg]]'s choice to defy her Catholic husband and smuggle Lutheran books to [[Ursula of Munsterberg]] and other nuns, Ursula (in 1528) published 69 articles justifying their reasons to leave their convent. Although her writings reached Martin Luther, they were listed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] from 1596 to 1900.\n\nIn 1590, [[Christine of Hesse]] published the psalm-book ''Geistliche Psalmen und Lieder''.\n\nThe only exception was the [[Anabaptist]] religion, where women could preach in church.\nThe only evidence of works or writings that are written by women are from their letters or through the testimonials of the woman who were being questioned about their faith. \nHowever, in 1569 [[Magdalena Heymair]] became the first woman ever to have her writings listed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]. She published a series of pedagogical writings for elementary-age teaching and also wrote poetry. It is also important to note that these testimonials, based on the women of the Reformation, were written by men.<ref>Grijp, Louis and Jolderma, Hermina (editors and translators), \"Elisabeth\u2019s Manly Courage: \nTestimonials and Songs of Martyred Anabaptist Women in the Low Countries,\"</ref> This lack of written work by women may have something to do with the fact that society was a male-dominated one and women were meant to complete their household duties and nothing else.\n\nLutheran poet [[Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg]] was exiled from her home in Austria during the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]].\n\n===Fewer female convents===\nSome convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197. It belongs to the group of so-called L\u00fcnekl\u00f6stern (monasteries of L\u00fcne), which became Lutheran convents following the Protestant Reformation. [\u2026] It is currently one of several Lutheran convents maintained by the Monastic Chamber of Hanover (Klosterkammer Hannover), an institution of the former Kingdom of Hanover founded by its Prince-Regent, later King George IV of the United Kingdom, in 1818, in order to manage and preserve the estates of Lutheran convents.}}</ref> Many of these convents in eastern Europe were closed by communist authorities after the Second World War. They are sometimes called [[Stift#Endowment_for_unmarried_Protestant_women|damenstift]]. One notable damenstift member, [[Catharina von Schlegel]] (1697-1768), wrote the hymn that was translated into English as ''[[Finlandia_hymn#\"Be_still,_my_soul\"|Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side]]''.  Three exclusively female Lutheran orders for women open today are the [[Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring]], the [[Daughters of Mary (Lutheran)|Daughters of Mary]], and the [[Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary]]. Although [[Communit\u00e4t Christusbruderschaft Selbitz]] is mixed, it is almost entirely female. \n\nOther convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry. In areas where convents were closed, this eliminated the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women.<ref>Allen, Charlotte. \"The Holy Feminine.\" Journal of Religion, Culture, and Public Life, 1999. Online: http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3241</ref> Martin Luther had not planned to get married, but former nun [[Katharina von Bora]] convinced him it would be a good idea to marry her. Due to her moderately wealthy background and a household license to brew and sell beer she was able to support Luther financially. [[Martin Luther]] himself taught that \"the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability to administer those affairs that are outside and concern the state\u2026.\"<ref>Luther, Martin.

Some of them include:\n*[[Anne Askew]] (1521\u20131546), tortured in the Tower of London and martyred in Smithfield for Protestantism\n*[[Joan Bocher]] (?\u20131550), English Anabaptist martyr in Smithfield\n*[[Stratford Martyrs|Elizabeth Pepper]] (?\u20131556), martyred while pregnant for Protestantism, together with Agnes George\n*[[Guernsey Martyrs]], three women martyred for Protestantism in 1556, one woman was pregnant and gave birth while being burned, the child was rescued but then ordered to be burned too\n*[[Joan Waste]] (1534\u20131556), blind woman martyred for Protestantism \n*[[Canterbury Martyrs|Alice Benden]] (?\u20131557), martyred for Protestantism\n*[[Alice Driver]] (?\u20131558), testified for and martyred for Protestantism\n*[[Marie Durand]] (1711\u20131776), imprisoned 38 years in the [[Aigues-Mortes#The_Tower_of_Constance_and_the_ramparts|Tower of Constance]] for Protestantism with 24 other women<ref>[http://www.rcus.org/huguenot-women-of-the-tower-of-constance/ Huguenot Women of the Tower of Constance]</ref>\n\n==Social attitudes==\nThe clergy could now be married, reducing illegitimate births although there is little if any evidence illegitimacy was mainly fueled by unmarried clergy. Women's voices in the Reformation were mostly suppressed with their writings destroyed because of the edict in the Bible for women to be silent. Many women tried to become involved in the Reformation all throughout Europe and some of their voices were heard while others were not. By the age of twelve, [[Olimpia Fulvia Morata]] (1526 \u20131555) was able to converse fluently in Greek and Latin. In her teens she lectured on Cicero and Calvin's works.<ref>{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6 | url-access=registration | authors= Robin, Diana Maury, Larsen, Anne R. and Levin, Carole| year=2007 | publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc|page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6/page/269 269]}}</ref> Her writings were published posthumously and also placed on the ''Index''. Another famous reformer John Calvin was known for contacting several noblewomen to ascertain their opinions on certain religious topics.<ref>Lindberg, Carter. \u201cLegacies of the Reformation,\u201d in The European Reformation Sourcebook. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. 261.</ref> This indicates that even the most well known of reformers were contacting women to hear what they may have to say on certain topics. In 1650, [[Silesians|Silesian]] astronomer [[Maria Cunitz]] published ''[[Urania Propitia]],'' which improved on [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s mathematical methods for locating planets. The book was published in both Latin ''and'' German, an unconventional decision that made the scientific text more accessible for non-university educated readers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-astronomer-who-took-on-most-advanced-science-180962142/|title=The 17th-Century Lady Astronomer Who Took Measure of the Stars|last=McNeill|first=Leila|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome women were part of social groups. For example, [[Princess Elisabeth Sophie of Saxe-Altenburg]] was a member of the ''Virtuous Society''.<ref>Erika Alma Metzger, Richard E.

[[Katharina von Bora]] who married the well known reformer Martin Luther set the standard of more roles given to a pastor's wife. She was also considered to be a horrible role model for those women who, like herself, had also dated into the clergy.\n\n[[Elisabeth of Hesse, Hereditary Princess of Saxony|Elisabeth of Hesse]] exposed the secret bigamy of her brother [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip]].\n\n===Education and domestic work===\nWomen were to be silent, obedient, and to perform household tasks, but this could vary considerably depending on social class and wealth. For example, commoner [[Kaarina Multiala]] (d. between 1563-1571) owned several ships and was a wealthy Finnish merchant. Another commoner, [[Brigitta Lars Anderssons]] (d. after 1551) was a folk healer who became the personal physician and nurse to the queen. Also, in 1572 Danish scientist [[Sophia Brahe]] (1556\u20131643) assisted her brother [[Tycho Brahe|Tycho]] with his astronomical observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe|publisher=National Schools' Observatory|accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=}}</ref> Also, [[Constantia Zierenberg]] (1605\u20131653) was a Calvinist daughter of a mayor. She was fluent in six languages and sang for royalty. The purpose of women's education was the development of an accepted concept of marriage and training in [[Home economics|domestic skills]], although Calvinist [[Anne Locke]] was a translator and poet who published the first English sonnet sequence. Women were taught how to look after children, care for their homes, make clothing for her family, and [[Animal husbandry|tend]] livestock. [[Anna Karlsdotter]] (d. 1552) was a noblewoman who retracted donations her ancestors had made to a church and died wealthy. Also, [[Countess Emilie Juliane of Barby-M\u00fchlingen|Countess Emilie Juliane]] (1637\u20131706) was educated in religion, Latin, history, and other subjects,<ref name=\"Koldau\">{{cite book \n| last = Koldau\n| first = Linda Maria\n| url = https://books.google.de/books?id=QmkQScqES9UC&pg=PA281\n| title = Frauen-Musik-Kultur: ein Handbuch zum deutschen Sprachgebiet der Fr\u00fchen Neuzeit\n| publisher = B\u00f6hlau Verlag\n| year = 2005\n| isbn = 3-64-756402-8\n| language = German\n| pages = 281\u2013286\n}}</ref> and went on to write 587 hymns that survive to the present day. The change was that women were now encouraged to study the Bible in vernacular language, to be a biblical influence for children and with their husband. By allowing women to become educated and read the bible, they found passages suggesting women were equal to men in the presence of God. The [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571|Swedish Church Ordinance of 1571]] mandated the education of girls along with the boys. [[Anna Taskomakare]] (c. 1480 - d. after 1528) was a successful and wealthy landlady who also traded copper and iron.\n\nBecause [[Elizabeth I of England]] was a woman, Parliament decided to make her the ''Supreme Governor of the Church of England'' instead of the ''Supreme Head of the Church of England''. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] she played a role in cultivating developed into the Protestant Church of England that exists today.\n\n\u00b0==Ecclesiastical status==\n===Women not allowed to preach or publish===\n[[Elisabeth Cruciger]] was a friend of Martin Luther and the first female Reformation-era hymn writer. [[Elizabeth Melville]] was the first woman to print a book in Scotland. Women's preaching or publishing material stood in direct opposition to the words ascribed to St. Paul (1 Timothy 2: 11-15) which ordered women not to teach or preach, so that all women who published felt it necessary to justify their actions.<ref>, Wiesner, Merry E., \"The Reformation of the Women,\" 148-149</ref> Even the sole alternative role for women which had existed outside of marriage, to join a convent, was no longer available in Reformed Protestant areas, although some convents voluntarily participated in the Reformation. For example, following [[Catherine of Mecklenburg]]'s choice to defy her Catholic husband and smuggle Lutheran books to [[Ursula of Munsterberg]] and other nuns, Ursula (in 1528) published 69 articles justifying their reasons to leave their convent. Although her writings reached Martin Luther, they were listed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] from 1596 to 1900.\n\nIn 1590, [[Christine of Hesse]] published the psalm-book ''Geistliche Psalmen und Lieder''.\n\nThe only exception was the [[Anabaptist]] religion, where women could preach in church.\nThe only evidence of works or writings that are written by women are from their letters or through the testimonials of the woman who were being questioned about their faith. \nHowever, in 1569 [[Magdalena Heymair]] became the first woman ever to have her writings listed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]. She published a series of pedagogical writings for elementary-age teaching and also wrote poetry. It is also important to note that these testimonials, based on the women of the Reformation, were written by men.<ref>Grijp, Louis and Jolderma, Hermina (editors and translators), \"Elisabeth\u2019s Manly Courage: \nTestimonials and Songs of Martyred Anabaptist Women in the Low Countries,\"</ref> This lack of written work by women may have something to do with the fact that society was a male-dominated one and women were meant to complete their household duties and nothing else.\n\nLutheran poet [[Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg]] was exiled from her home in Austria during the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]].\n\n===Fewer female convents===\nSome convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197. It belongs to the group of so-called L\u00fcnekl\u00f6stern (monasteries of L\u00fcne), which became Lutheran convents following the Protestant Reformation. [\u2026] It is currently one of several Lutheran convents maintained by the Monastic Chamber of Hanover (Klosterkammer Hannover), an institution of the former Kingdom of Hanover founded by its Prince-Regent, later King George IV of the United Kingdom, in 1818, in order to manage and preserve the estates of Lutheran convents.}}</ref> Many of these convents in eastern Europe were closed by communist authorities after the Second World War. They are sometimes called [[Stift#Endowment_for_unmarried_Protestant_women|damenstift]]. One notable damenstift member, [[Catharina von Schlegel]] (1697-1768), wrote the hymn that was translated into English as ''[[Finlandia_hymn#\"Be_still,_my_soul\"|Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side]]''.  Three exclusively female Lutheran orders for women open today are the [[Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring]], the [[Daughters of Mary (Lutheran)|Daughters of Mary]], and the [[Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary]]. Although [[Communit\u00e4t Christusbruderschaft Selbitz]] is mixed, it is almost entirely female. \n\nOther convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry. In areas where convents were closed, this eliminated the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women.<ref>Allen, Charlotte. \"The Holy Feminine.\" Journal of Religion, Culture, and Public Life, 1999. Online: http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3241</ref> Martin Luther had not planned to get married, but former nun [[Katharina von Bora]] convinced him it would be a good idea to marry her. Due to her moderately wealthy background and a household license to brew and sell beer she was able to support Luther financially. [[Martin Luther]] himself taught that \"the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability to administer those affairs that are outside and concern the state\u2026.\"<ref>Luther, Martin.

Women's voices in the Reformation were mostly suppressed with their writings destroyed because of the edict in the Bible for women to be silent. Many women tried to become involved in the Reformation all throughout Europe and some of their voices were heard while others were not. By the age of twelve, [[Olimpia Fulvia Morata]] (1526 \u20131555) was able to converse fluently in Greek and Latin. In her teens she lectured on Cicero and Calvin's works.<ref>{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6 | url-access=registration | authors= Robin, Diana Maury, Larsen, Anne R. and Levin, Carole| year=2007 | publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc|page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6/page/269 269]}}</ref> Her writings were published posthumously and also placed on the ''Index''. Another famous reformer John Calvin was known for contacting several noblewomen to ascertain their opinions on certain religious topics.<ref>Lindberg, Carter. \u201cLegacies of the Reformation,\u201d in The European Reformation Sourcebook. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. 261.</ref> This indicates that even the most well known of reformers were contacting women to hear what they may have to say on certain topics. In 1650, [[Silesians|Silesian]] astronomer [[Maria Cunitz]] published ''[[Urania Propitia]],'' which improved on [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s mathematical methods for locating planets. The book was published in both Latin ''and'' German, an unconventional decision that made the scientific text more accessible for non-university educated readers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-astronomer-who-took-on-most-advanced-science-180962142/|title=The 17th-Century Lady Astronomer Who Took Measure of the Stars|last=McNeill|first=Leila|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome women were part of social groups.
