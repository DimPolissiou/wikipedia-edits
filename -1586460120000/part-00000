The dispute centered about the chemical compounds [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|H|2|CO}}) and [[methylene glycol]] ({{chem|H|2|C|(|OH|)|2}}), which are the active ingredients of the process, responsible for binding the keratin to the hair.  Formaldehyde is a gas that, when dissolved in water (including fluids in the human body), converts partially to methylene glycol.  In the liquid, the two compounds coexist in a [[chemical equilibrium]].\n\n===Regulations about formaldehyde levels===\n\nFormaldehyde in the air has long been recognized as a major [[occupational hazard]] in many industries; such as those using [[urea-formaldehyde]] (UF) adhesives, or UF-based products like [[fiberboard]], and UFFI [[spray foam]] insulation.  Levels below 0.05 parts per million (ppm) were found to be positively correlated with eye and nasal irritation.<ref>I.Broder, P.Corey, P. Brasher, M.

OSHA conducted air sampling at multiple salons and found formaldehyde in the air when stylists were using hair smoothing products. Some of these products were labeled \"formaldehyde free\" or did not list formaldehyde on the product label or in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). In most cases, where the label did not state that the product had formaldehyde in it, OSHA found that hair salon owners using those products did not know that hair smoothing products contain or could expose workers to formaldehyde because manufacturers, importers, and distributors did not include the correct hazard warnings on the product\u2019s label or MSDS.\n\nDuring Federal OSHA investigations, air tests showed formaldehyde at levels above OSHA's limits in salons using Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution, labeled \"formaldehyde free\", and Brasil Cacau Cadiveu. Both Federal and State OSHA have found violations at several manufacturers, importers, and distributors (GIB LLC dba Brazilian Blowout, Keratronics Inc., Pro Skin Solutions, M&M International Inc., Copomon, INOVA Professional). The violations include failing to list formaldehyde as a hazardous ingredient on the MSDS (the hazard warning sheet) provided to downstream users (e.g., salon owners, stylists), failing to include proper hazard warnings on product labels, and failing to list the health effects of formaldehyde exposure on the MSDS. Labels must include ingredient and hazard warning information and the MSDS must provide users with information about the chemicals in a product, the hazards to workers, and how to use a product safely.\n\nIf salon owners decide to use products that may contain or release formaldehyde, they must then follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards to protect worker safety. Requirements include steps such as testing salon air during treatments to determine formaldehyde levels, providing adequate ventilation and appropriate personal protective equipment for workers performing treatments, and training workers on the hazards of formaldehyde. Failure to follow the requirements of the formaldehyde and hazard communication standards has consequences. As part of OSHA's enforcement duties, the agency issues citations to five manufacturers, three distributors, two beauty schools and 42 salon owners.<ref>{{cite web|title=OSHA Enforcement Response|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hairsalons/government_response.html#federal|work=Occupational Safety & Health Administration}}</ref>  Citations were issued for reasons including, but not limited to: failing to communicate the hazards of exposure to formaldehyde, formaldehyde levels were above the OSHA 15-minute [[Short-term exposure limit|short term exposure level]], and not following the requirements of OSHA's formaldehyde standard.\n\n=== California safety and health investigation ===\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris announced a settlement with GIB LLC dba Brazilian Blowout requiring a payment of $600,000 in fines and changes to Brazilian Blowout Acai Smoothing Solution and the Brazilian Blowout Professional Smoothing Solution MSDS and labeling.<ref name=\"ag.ca.gov\">{{cite web|title=California Safety and Health Settlement|date=January 30, 2012|url=http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=2617|work=State of California Department of Justice}}</ref> Under the terms of the settlement, GIB is required to:\n\n* Produce a complete and accurate safety information sheet on the two products that includes a Proposition 65 cancer warning; distribute this information to recent product purchasers who may still have product on hand; and distribute it with all future product shipments.

Anhydrous formaldehyde gas readily dissolves in and reacts with water to form an equilibrium solution of methylene glycol. When heated, the equilibrium shifts and favors the production of formaldehyde and water. Thus, the manufacturer of Brazilian Blowout argued that methylene glycol is in their products, not formaldehyde, and therefore they can claim that their product was formaldehyde-free. The first involves nomenclature. The second issue is the method by which formaldehyde concentration is measured. The third involves measurements of formaldehyde concentration in bottles of the product in which the reported concentration is dependent upon both the method of measurement and nomenclature. However, the company reached a settlement with the state of California and is no longer claiming their products are formaldehyde free.<ref name=\"ag.ca.gov\"/>\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS)<ref>{{cite web|title=CAS Content|url=http://www.cas.org/expertise/cascontent/index.html|work=Chemical Abstracts Service: A division of the American Chemical Society}}</ref> lists [[formaldehyde]] (50-00-0<ref>{{cite web|title=Formaldehyde Basic information|url=http://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductChemicalPropertiesCB4853677_EN.htm|work=Chemical Book}}</ref>) and methylene glycol (463-57-0<ref>[[Methanediol]]</ref>) as two different substances.

According to Golden and Valentini even in worst case experiments less than half of the methylene glycol result in measurable formaldehyde gas, also an unknown portion of this measurement is due to the combining of the volatilised methylene glycol being reported as gaseous formaldehyde, furthermore the reverse reaction is much rapid and much more favourable at STP equilibrium which is not taken into account in the analysis.

The dispute centered about the chemical compounds [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|H|2|CO}}) and [[methylene glycol]] ({{chem|H|2|C|(|OH|)|2}}), which are the active ingredients of the process, responsible for binding the keratin to the hair.  Formaldehyde is a gas that, when dissolved in water (including fluids in the human body), converts partially to methylene glycol.  In the liquid, the two compounds coexist in a [[chemical equilibrium]].\n\n===Regulations about formaldehyde levels===\n\nFormaldehyde in the air has long been recognized as a major [[occupational hazard]] in many industries; such as those using [[urea-formaldehyde]] (UF) adhesives, or UF-based products like [[fiberboard]], and UFFI [[spray foam]] insulation.  Levels below 0.05 parts per million (ppm) were found to be positively correlated with eye and nasal irritation.<ref>I.Broder, P.Corey, P. Brasher, M.

OSHA conducted air sampling at multiple salons and found formaldehyde in the air when stylists were using hair smoothing products. Some of these products were labeled \"formaldehyde free\" or did not list formaldehyde on the product label or in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). In most cases, where the label did not state that the product had formaldehyde in it, OSHA found that hair salon owners using those products did not know that hair smoothing products contain or could expose workers to formaldehyde because manufacturers, importers, and distributors did not include the correct hazard warnings on the product\u2019s label or MSDS.\n\nDuring Federal OSHA investigations, air tests showed formaldehyde at levels above OSHA's limits in salons using Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution, labeled \"formaldehyde free\", and Brasil Cacau Cadiveu. Both Federal and State OSHA have found violations at several manufacturers, importers, and distributors (GIB LLC dba Brazilian Blowout, Keratronics Inc., Pro Skin Solutions, M&M International Inc., Copomon, INOVA Professional). The violations include failing to list formaldehyde as a hazardous ingredient on the MSDS (the hazard warning sheet) provided to downstream users (e.g., salon owners, stylists), failing to include proper hazard warnings on product labels, and failing to list the health effects of formaldehyde exposure on the MSDS. Labels must include ingredient and hazard warning information and the MSDS must provide users with information about the chemicals in a product, the hazards to workers, and how to use a product safely.\n\nIf salon owners decide to use products that may contain or release formaldehyde, they must then follow the requirements in OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards to protect worker safety. Requirements include steps such as testing salon air during treatments to determine formaldehyde levels, providing adequate ventilation and appropriate personal protective equipment for workers performing treatments, and training workers on the hazards of formaldehyde. Failure to follow the requirements of the formaldehyde and hazard communication standards has consequences. As part of OSHA's enforcement duties, the agency issues citations to five manufacturers, three distributors, two beauty schools and 42 salon owners.<ref>{{cite web|title=OSHA Enforcement Response|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hairsalons/government_response.html#federal|work=Occupational Safety & Health Administration}}</ref>  Citations were issued for reasons including, but not limited to: failing to communicate the hazards of exposure to formaldehyde, formaldehyde levels were above the OSHA 15-minute [[Short-term exposure limit|short term exposure level]], and not following the requirements of OSHA's formaldehyde standard.\n\n=== California safety and health investigation ===\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris announced a settlement with GIB LLC dba Brazilian Blowout requiring a payment of $600,000 in fines and changes to Brazilian Blowout Acai Smoothing Solution and the Brazilian Blowout Professional Smoothing Solution MSDS and labeling.<ref name=\"ag.ca.gov\">{{cite web|title=California Safety and Health Settlement|date=January 30, 2012|url=http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=2617|work=State of California Department of Justice}}</ref> Under the terms of the settlement, GIB is required to:\n\n* Produce a complete and accurate safety information sheet on the two products that includes a Proposition 65 cancer warning; distribute this information to recent product purchasers who may still have product on hand; and distribute it with all future product shipments. The revised safety information sheet will be posted on the company's web site.\n* Affix \"CAUTION\" stickers to the bottles of the two products to inform stylists of the emission of formaldehyde gas and the need for precautionary measures, including adequate ventilation.\n* Cease deceptive advertising of the products as formaldehyde-free and safe; engage in substantial corrective advertising, including honest communications to sales staff regarding product risks; and change numerous aspects of Brazilian Blowout's web site content.\n* Retest the two products for total smog-forming chemicals (volatile organic compounds) at two Department of Justice-approved laboratories, and work with DOJ and the Air Resources Board to ensure that those products comply with state air quality regulations.\n* Report the presence of formaldehyde in its products to the Safe Cosmetics Program at the Department of Public Health.\n* Disclose refund policies to consumers before the products are purchased.\n* Require proof of professional licensing before selling \"salon use only\" products to stylists.\n\n== Health concerns ==\nThe U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) warns that Brazilian Blowouts are hazardous to the health of those who use them and the hairdressers who apply them.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA: Brazilian Blowout Hair Straightener Is Dangerous\n|date=September 7, 2011|first=Bill|last=Hendrick|url=http://www.webmd.com/healthy-beauty/news/20110907/fda-brazilian-blowout-hair-straightener-is-dangerous|work=WebMD}}</ref>\n\nConcerns over the presence of formaldehyde in various hair smoothing products at significant concentrations centered whether [[methylene glycol]] could legally be synonymous with formaldehyde.  Anhydrous formaldehyde gas readily dissolves in and reacts with water to form an equilibrium solution of methylene glycol. When heated, the equilibrium shifts and favors the production of formaldehyde and water. Thus, the manufacturer of Brazilian Blowout argued that methylene glycol is in their products, not formaldehyde, and therefore they can claim that their product was formaldehyde-free. The first involves nomenclature. The second issue is the method by which formaldehyde concentration is measured. The third involves measurements of formaldehyde concentration in bottles of the product in which the reported concentration is dependent upon both the method of measurement and nomenclature. However, the company reached a settlement with the state of California and is no longer claiming their products are formaldehyde free.<ref name=\"ag.ca.gov\"/>\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS)<ref>{{cite web|title=CAS Content|url=http://www.cas.org/expertise/cascontent/index.html|work=Chemical Abstracts Service: A division of the American Chemical Society}}</ref> lists [[formaldehyde]] (50-00-0<ref>{{cite web|title=Formaldehyde Basic information|url=http://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductChemicalPropertiesCB4853677_EN.htm|work=Chemical Book}}</ref>) and methylene glycol (463-57-0<ref>[[Methanediol]]</ref>) as two different substances.

When heat is applied in the Brazilian blowout process causes the methylene glycol to dehydrate, yielding [[formaldehyde|formaldehyde gas]] and [[water vapor|water vapours]]. According to Golden and Valentini even in worst case experiments less than half of the methylene glycol result in measurable formaldehyde gas, also an unknown portion of this measurement is due to the combining of the volatilised methylene glycol being reported as gaseous formaldehyde, furthermore the reverse reaction is much rapid and much more favourable at STP equilibrium which is not taken into account in the analysis.

He is a lead miner. The north choir aisle of Wirksworth church is dominated by a far more ostentatious monument, a large ornate alabaster chest tomb, a memorial to Ralph Gell of [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]], who died in 1563. The simple figure of the miner bears witness to the fact that for centuries the people of [[Wirksworth]] and their neighbours relied on lead mining. Ralph Gell's imposing tomb is evidence that a few people became rich and powerful from the trade.\n\nWhile Derbyshire lead made Gell and others rich, for poor families it was both a living and an adventure, with the possibility of a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref> Mining was hard and dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, [[methane]] gas in [[shale]] workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries.<ref>Willies 1982, p.28</ref>  From the later years of the 17th century [[gunpowder]] introduced a further hazard.<ref>Rieuwerts 1998, p.83</ref> Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the [[limestone]] landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] \"many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting greatt quantities of lead for the use of the Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...\".<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/10/9/35.</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot6.jpg|thumb|Smithycove Mine, Hopton]]\nBy the 17th century lead was second in importance in the national economy only to wool. It was essential for the roofs of public buildings and the new houses being built in every part of the country by the nobility and gentry. All houses, including farmhouses and cottages by then, had glazed windows, with lead glazing bars. It was the only material for water storage and piping. Every army used it as [[ammunition]]. There was a thriving export trade as well as the home market and the Wirksworth area was the main source of the [[ore]].\n\nWirksworth was the administrative centre of one of the ''hundreds'', local government units, of Derbyshire. Uniquely, the Wirksworth Hundred was still known by the archaic term ''[[Wapentake]]''. [[Lead ore]] was Crown property in most places and the mining area of Derbyshire under royal control was known as the King's Field, with two separately administered divisions, the High and Low Peaks, each further divided into ''liberties'', based on [[parish]]es. Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low Peak area of the King's Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, [[Middleton-by-Wirksworth]], [[Cromford]], [[Brassington]], [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], [[Middleton-by-Youlgreave]], [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]], Hopton and [[Carsington]], and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang,<ref>Wirksworth Wapentake Survey, 1652: British Library, Add.

This is limestone country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of [[galena]]: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed \"pigs\", or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence.<ref>Barnatt 1999</ref> In the 9th century [[Repton Abbey]] owned mines at Wirksworth and when the [[abbey]] was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]].<ref>Ford & Rieuwerts 2000, p.18</ref> They remained in royal hands after the [[Norman conquest]] of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and [[smelting]] was an established industry in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and [[Bakewell]] were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-143994-7}} p.741</ref>\n\n==Mining methods==\n[[File:Dirtlow Rake - geograph.org.uk - 2368667.jpg|right|thumb|Dirtlow Rake near Pindale]]\n\nLead had traditionally been found by following veins from surface outcroppings, particularly in \"rakes\" or vertical fissures.<ref>Willies 1982, p.7</ref>  By the 17th century, however, most surface lead had been mined and prospecting was achieved by less direct methods. Miners searched for surface signs that were similar to known lead-rich areas, they checked ploughed and other disturbed land for traces of ore, and they checked for signs in plants and trees and poorly performing crops, since lead is poisonous to most living things. They used probes to check for signs of ore in soil a few feet under the surface and dug exploratory holes or trenches in promising places. This was usually done to choose the best places to sink shafts ahead of existing working and the rules defined when and where these activities could be carried out.\n\nThe miners sank their shafts in ''turns'' of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}, each turn being a few yards away from the bottom of the preceding one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or ''stemples'', wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These ''climbing shafts'' were usually within the miners' ''coe'', the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an ''[[adit]]'' or tunnel driven into the slope.\n\nOre was brought to the surface up a ''winding shaft'' outside the coe. The miners' equipment included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, ''wiskets'' or baskets to contain it, ''corves'' or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or ''stows'', to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway can be found in the Merry Tom mine, near [[Via Gellia]].<ref>Personal communication by John Jones to Ron Slack 2000</ref> The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to [[fire-setting]].<ref>Willies 1994</ref> A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.\n\n==16th-century technical change==\n\nAfter a mid-16th-century slump the industry recovered, new mines were opened on Middleton Moor, and production increased, a recovery mainly due to technical developments. While traditional extraction methods had persisted there were vital changes in the ways in which ore was prepared for smelting and in the smelting process itself.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.164</ref>\n\n===Bole smelting===\n\nThe traditional [[smelter]] was a ''bole'', a large fire built on a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as ''bing'' and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.<ref>D. Kiernan & R. Van de Noort 1992</ref>\n\n===Smelting mills===\n\nIn the late 16th century wind power was abandoned and the smelting blast was provided by a [[bellows]] driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by \u201cwhite coal\u201d, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to [[charcoal]] for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which would have made it difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. Draught for the furnaces came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.<ref>Crossley 1992</ref>\n\n===Dressing===\n\nBefore a miner could sell his ore he had to dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock in which it was embedded and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a ''bucker'' or, in larger mines, on a ''crushing circle'', where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a ''buddle'' or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.200</ref>\n[[File:minphot1.jpg|thumb|Remains of stone washing buddle at Perseverance Mine on Carsington Pasture]]\n\n==Mining customs==\n\nEverything about the old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole structure was designed to enable the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot4.jpg|thumb|Barmote Hall, Wirksworth]]\nIt was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called \"free mining\". Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant amount of ore was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to it as long as he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster's tenants at [[Brassington]] complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle.<ref>The National Archives, DL43/1/19, PFF 1322.</ref>  In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1 shilling, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, 166M/M1.</ref> But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.\n\n===King's farmers and chief barmasters===\n\nThe coveted and valuable farm of the Duchy of Lancaster's right to the lead mine duties, coupled as it was with the office of chief barmaster, endowed its owner with both a considerable income and authority over the running of the industry. It was always resold at a much higher price than that charged by the Duchy, which was  \u00a3110 plus annual payments of \u00a372 for the duties and \u00a31-6-8d for the barmastership.<ref name=\"Slack_a\"/>\n\n===Chief barmasters and the 24===\n\nAt dinner in Wirksworth after meetings of the 17th-century Barmote Court, the landlord of the inn had three tables for those attending the Court.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/28/2a.</ref> There was the \"24 table\", where the members of the 24-man jury sat, and where he charged 8d per head, \"the barmasters' table\", at 10d a head, and a table where \"gentlemen's dinners\" cost 1 shilling each. The gentlemen drank sack or [[claret]] with their dinner; the men were served with beer. The bill was paid by the king's farmer and chief barmaster. There were usually about a dozen gentlemen, some of whom were members of the jury, while others were there to present a case to the Court. Also among the gentlemen were the steward of the court, who was a lawyer and who conducted the sessions. When the chief barmaster for the Wapentake, always a man of wealth and rank, was a local gentleman such as Sir John Gell of Hopton<ref name=\"Slack_a\" /> or his son John, the 2nd baronet, he often attended the Court himself. If the current chief barmaster was an absentee member of the gentry or nobility he relied on his deputy barmasters.\n\nIn addition to helping the barmasters to carry out their duties the 24 jurors brought practical experience to bear when the Barmote Court was adjudicating in disputes and trials. The main requirement of the jurymen was that they should be knowledgeable in mining matters and they included both working miners and, when it was thought necessary, local gentry.\n\n===Deputy barmasters===\n\nThe deputy barmasters whom the chief barmaster appointed were experienced local men. Some of them were yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen.<ref>Slack 1991</ref>  The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much of the business of the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required them to be able to read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it was measured by the dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as ''lot''. This was the barmaster's ''reckoning''. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called ''cope''.\n\n===Giving a mine===\n\nThe barmaster or his deputy granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was ''grove'' or ''groove'', on receipt of proof that it was viable. The proof was a standard container, a dish, filled with about {{convert|65|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of ore from the mine in question. Every dish was calibrated by the barmaster twice a year against a brass standard dish. The miner thus granted title to the mine was said to have ''freed'' it, either ''for old'' if a development in an existing mine, or ''for new'' in the case of a new discovery. He was given permission to work 2 ''meers'' of ground, known as ''founder meers'', with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, ''taker meers'', along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his ''possessions'' or ''stows'' (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to ''wind'' the ore from the shaft). A meer was {{convert|29|yd|m}}, in the Wirksworth Wapentake.\n\nSince the course of a vein of lead was unpredictable, there were many disputes caused by one group of miners following a vein into another mine. There were occasions when possession was disputed by physical means.\n\n===Title-holding and record keeping===\n\nThe deputy barmasters were responsible for settling disputes over ownership or of ''arresting'' or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left unworked. They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to ''nick'' the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: \"Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte.\"<ref>National Archive DL 30/54/669A</ref>\n\nThe deputy barmasters kept records of all changes of title and of the amounts of ore measured and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular ''reckonings'' at the mines. The lot and cope ''accounts'' involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, the name of the miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the amount of ore mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the amount of ore sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/58/24</ref> Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives \"to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\">Derbyshire Record Office D258/30/16-24</ref> Many of their records have survived.\n\n===Accidents===\n\nIn conjunction with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner in the case of fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in Throstle Nest mine.\n\n<blockquote>Wirksworth Wapentake March 26th 1761.\nWe, whose names are under written, being this day summoned by Mr. Edward Ashton, Bar-Master for the Liberty of Brassington, to a groove called by the name of Throstle Nest on Brassington Pasture; to enquire into the cause of the death of T.W. now lying before us; accordingly we have been down the shaft to the Foot thereof, and down one sump or turn to the foot thereof, and on a gate North-wardly about sixteen yards to the Forefield, where the deceased had been at work; and by the information of William Briddon who was working near him; it appears that a large stone fell upon him out of the roof, and it is our opinions the said stone was the cause of his death.<ref>Hardy 1762</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:minphot2.jpg|thumb|Datestone of TW, the miner killed in Throstlenest Mine in 1761, carved on limestone outcrop a few feet from the mineshaft]]\n\n===Structure of industry===\n\nThe free mining arrangement under the rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy's lessee of the mineral rights at the end of the 16th century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land.<ref>Wood 1999, p.207</ref> Shrewsbury's success embedded the old rules and facilitated free mining.\n\nThere was one independent area within the Wapentake, Griffe Grange, near Brassington, held by the Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/53/3a,b,c</ref> The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/20/7/1-40</ref> Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him \"to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\" /> This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.\n\nFor historical reasons the structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues.<ref>Wood 1999, pp.238\u2013248</ref> The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.\n\nThe operation of the old rules and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent the development of a complicated structure there. The barmasters' ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters' accounts for 1653<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/28/20c</ref> show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden's Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called \"cavers\".\n\n==Pollution==\n\nLead is poisonous to both plants and animals. For people the smelting processes are the most dangerous \u2013 the restored smelter at Spitewinter, near Chesterfield, stands a few yards from Belland Lane, ''belland'' being lead poisoning. The current owners of the smelter on the site of the former Mill Close mine at Darley Bridge have bought much of the adjoining land and turned arable and pasture into woodland, to avoid the danger to crops and animals.\n\nThe danger to plants and animals, particularly from washing or \"buddling\", has been known for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. \"For buddling ... I have heard that miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them.\"<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6681, ff140-141 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref>\n\nIn 1794 several groups of Wensley miners who had buddled mine waste in the river Derwent above and below Darley Bridge were brought to court, accused of polluting the river.<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6676, ff132-160 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> Witnesses described the river as being muddied as far down-river as a mile below Cromford Bridge, and a Matlock publican claimed to have been prevented from his usual practice of using river water for his brewing by the state of the Derwent. He had had to sink a well to stay in business. Mining law was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into \"some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)\" to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine \u2013 their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent \u2013 lost their case.\n[[File:minphot3.jpg|thumb|Settling pond for washing sludge at Corsehill Mine, Brassington]]\nIn addition to the mining law to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations \u2013 there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas as well as the recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills were provided with chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.157</ref>  Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.\n\n==Mine drainage==\n\nUntil the 17th century mining had usually been abandoned when the work reached the water table. Efforts at draining lead mines by horse-powered pumps, or \u201cengines\u201d, had little success. In the later years of the industry mines were successfully drained by hydraulic, steam, internal combustion and electric power, but the first successes were achieved by soughs, drainage tunnels driven into flooded veins to allow the water to run off.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987</ref> Dr Rieuwerts has provided a comprehensive gazetteer of the Derbyshire lead mining soughs. By lowering the water table and opening up large new deposits of lead ore, they transformed the industry.\n\nThe first [[sough]], designed by Sir [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], knighted for his work in draining the East Anglian fens, was driven over a twenty-year period from a point on Cromford Hill, between [[Cromford]] and [[Wirksworth]], into an area called the Dovegang. When it was completed in 1652 there was an immediate jump in ore production in the area. Vermuyden's was followed by a succession of soughs which by the end of the century had drained enough of the mines in the Wirksworth Wapentake to cause a dramatic rise in production in the whole area. The most important were the Cromford Sough, which was over thirty years in driving, between 1662 and 1696, and was continued in the 18th century, and Hannage Sough, begun in 1693 and also continued into the next century. The Cromford Sough provided the power for [[Richard Arkwright]]'s mills at Cromford, the first of which was built in 1771. Also among the important 17th century soughs were the Raventor, begun in 1655, Bates (1657\u201384), Lees (1664), and Baileycroft (1667\u201373). The Baileycroft Sough drained mines in Wirksworth. Those in the area just to the north of Wirksworth called the Gulf were drained by the Raventor and Lees Soughs. The Bates and Cromford Soughs drained mines on Cromford Moor \u2014 Bates Sough had reached the Dovegang by 1684. Hannage Sough drained the area to the east of Yokecliffe Rake, on the south of Wirksworth.\n\nDrainage of the mines in the whole of the Wirksworth area was eventually accomplished by the Meerbrook Sough, begun at the level of the river Derwent in 1772, at a time when lead-mining ventures had become only intermittently profitable. The entrance to this sough is {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=off}} high and has a keystone inscribed \u201cFH 1772\u201d. FH was Francis Hurt of Alderwasley, smelter, lead mine shareholder, iron-master and the main shareholder in the sough. It still discharges {{convert|12|e6impgal|m3}} to {{convert|20|e6impgal|m3}} a day, and by the 1830s had so reduced the flow from the Cromford Sough that in 1846 Richard Arkwright's successor had to end production at the Cromford mills.<ref>Cooper, B. 1983, p.78</ref>\nIn other areas the Mill Close mines between Winster and Wensley, and the mines of Youlgreave were soughed.\n\n==Cupola smelting ==\n\nThe mills which had superseded the ancient bolehills in the late 16th century, a development described above, were themselves superseded in the 18th century by the gradual introduction of a new type of furnace known as the [[Reverberatory furnace|cupola]].<ref>Willies 1990</ref>\n\nThe old mills had a number of disadvantages. Their characteristic overheating and dissemination of polluting fumes made it necessary to close the smelter down at the end of each day's work. The hearth burned out quickly and regular weekly repairs or rebuilding were necessary \u2013 between 24 June and 29 September 1657, for instance, thirteen new hearths were required at the Upper Mill in [[Wirksworth]].<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/61/49b.</ref> Water-powered smelting mills were restricted to riverside sites and \u201cwhite coal\u201d fuel required a good supply of timber. By the 18th century timber supplies were running out and, where [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or coal was used because of timber shortages, impurities, particularly sulphur, were introduced into the lead. It was, finally, less efficient than the cupola.\n\nThe cupola was a [[reverberatory furnace]]. The fuel was burned in a combustion chamber at the side of the furnace, separate from the \u201ccharge\u201d of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the cupola's greater efficiency than the smelting mill. Unlike the smelting mill, the cupola could be operated continuously. Since the air flow over the ore was less powerful than that from the bellows of the blast furnace fewer lead particles were blown away. Further lead was saved by the fact that since the fuel and the charge were separate none of the lead was lost into the ash. Since no water power was needed the cupola had a fourth theoretical advantage of being freed from the riverside location of the blast furnace, and able to be placed in the most convenient site for supply of ore and coal. However, the higher temperatures needed to melt the slag recovered from the primary melt required a water-powered furnace and, since slag mills tended to be placed next to the cupolas, most cupolas remained in riverside sites.\n\nMany cupolas had long horizontal flues, which were introduced to trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of the flue could also be recovered for resmelting.\n\n==Closure==\n\nThe Derbyshire lead industry declined after the late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production costs and the discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by import duty in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845<ref>6 Geo IV c104 & 8 & 9 Vic. c.90 respectively (quoted in Burt,1984, p.235)</ref> brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry's decline.\n\nThere were still bursts of high production, and indeed the output of certain mines during the 18th and 19th centuries exceeded anything achieved in the 17th century; over 2658 loads (about 641 [[long ton|ton]]s or 651 [[tonne|metric tonnes]]) were mined at Brassington, traditionally an area of low output, in 1862.<ref>Chatsworth House. Barmaster's Collection. Transcript Roger Flindall</ref>  At a meeting of the Barmote Court in Wirksworth in 1862 one mine owner announced \"that by perseverance for upwards of twenty years, they had at last found the long sought for treasure, which he hoped would be prosperous, and they should be able to continue employing, as they are at the present time, upwards of 100 men at one mine in Brassington\".<ref>''Derby & Chesterfield Reporter'', 2 May 1862, p.8, col.6</ref>  However, by 1901 the number of men employed in all the Derbyshire lead mines had fallen to 285<ref>Ford, TD and Rieuwerts, JH, 2000, p.60</ref> most of whom worked at the [[Mill Close Mine]] at Darley Bridge. Mill Close, the biggest lead mine in the country, took the Derbyshire lead industry into the 20th century, and just before its enforced closure in 1939, caused by flooding, employed about 600 men.<ref>Willies 1989</ref> The smelter at Mill Close, established in 1934, was bought in 1941 by H J Enthoven and Sons, a London-based lead producer, and still operates.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Derbyshire}}\n* [[Odin Mine]]\n* [[Beans and Bacon mine]]\n* [[Peak District Mining Museum]]\n* [[Killhope Wheel]], Lead Mining Museum, Co.

He is a lead miner. The north choir aisle of Wirksworth church is dominated by a far more ostentatious monument, a large ornate alabaster chest tomb, a memorial to Ralph Gell of [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]], who died in 1563. The simple figure of the miner bears witness to the fact that for centuries the people of [[Wirksworth]] and their neighbours relied on lead mining. Ralph Gell's imposing tomb is evidence that a few people became rich and powerful from the trade.\n\nWhile Derbyshire lead made Gell and others rich, for poor families it was both a living and an adventure, with the possibility of a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref> Mining was hard and dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, [[methane]] gas in [[shale]] workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries.<ref>Willies 1982, p.28</ref>  From the later years of the 17th century [[gunpowder]] introduced a further hazard.<ref>Rieuwerts 1998, p.83</ref> Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the [[limestone]] landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] \"many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting greatt quantities of lead for the use of the Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...\".<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/10/9/35.</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot6.jpg|thumb|Smithycove Mine, Hopton]]\nBy the 17th century lead was second in importance in the national economy only to wool. It was essential for the roofs of public buildings and the new houses being built in every part of the country by the nobility and gentry. All houses, including farmhouses and cottages by then, had glazed windows, with lead glazing bars. It was the only material for water storage and piping. Every army used it as [[ammunition]]. There was a thriving export trade as well as the home market and the Wirksworth area was the main source of the [[ore]].\n\nWirksworth was the administrative centre of one of the ''hundreds'', local government units, of Derbyshire. Uniquely, the Wirksworth Hundred was still known by the archaic term ''[[Wapentake]]''. [[Lead ore]] was Crown property in most places and the mining area of Derbyshire under royal control was known as the King's Field, with two separately administered divisions, the High and Low Peaks, each further divided into ''liberties'', based on [[parish]]es. Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low Peak area of the King's Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, [[Middleton-by-Wirksworth]], [[Cromford]], [[Brassington]], [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], [[Middleton-by-Youlgreave]], [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]], Hopton and [[Carsington]], and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang,<ref>Wirksworth Wapentake Survey, 1652: British Library, Add. MS. 6686, ff133-135 (copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> {{convert|200|acre|km2}} on Cromford Moor which had become extremely productive after being drained by the first of the Derbyshire drainage schemes, or ''[[sough]]s''.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987, p.104</ref>\n\nThere had always been lead mining in and around Wirksworth. This is limestone country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of [[galena]]: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed \"pigs\", or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence.<ref>Barnatt 1999</ref> In the 9th century [[Repton Abbey]] owned mines at Wirksworth and when the [[abbey]] was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]].<ref>Ford & Rieuwerts 2000, p.18</ref> They remained in royal hands after the [[Norman conquest]] of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and [[smelting]] was an established industry in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and [[Bakewell]] were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-143994-7}} p.741</ref>\n\n==Mining methods==\n[[File:Dirtlow Rake - geograph.org.uk - 2368667.jpg|right|thumb|Dirtlow Rake near Pindale]]\n\nLead had traditionally been found by following veins from surface outcroppings, particularly in \"rakes\" or vertical fissures.<ref>Willies 1982, p.7</ref>  By the 17th century, however, most surface lead had been mined and prospecting was achieved by less direct methods. Miners searched for surface signs that were similar to known lead-rich areas, they checked ploughed and other disturbed land for traces of ore, and they checked for signs in plants and trees and poorly performing crops, since lead is poisonous to most living things. They used probes to check for signs of ore in soil a few feet under the surface and dug exploratory holes or trenches in promising places. This was usually done to choose the best places to sink shafts ahead of existing working and the rules defined when and where these activities could be carried out.\n\nThe miners sank their shafts in ''turns'' of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}, each turn being a few yards away from the bottom of the preceding one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or ''stemples'', wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These ''climbing shafts'' were usually within the miners' ''coe'', the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an ''[[adit]]'' or tunnel driven into the slope.\n\nOre was brought to the surface up a ''winding shaft'' outside the coe. The miners' equipment included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, ''wiskets'' or baskets to contain it, ''corves'' or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or ''stows'', to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway can be found in the Merry Tom mine, near [[Via Gellia]].<ref>Personal communication by John Jones to Ron Slack 2000</ref> The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to [[fire-setting]].<ref>Willies 1994</ref> A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.\n\n==16th-century technical change==\n\nAfter a mid-16th-century slump the industry recovered, new mines were opened on Middleton Moor, and production increased, a recovery mainly due to technical developments. While traditional extraction methods had persisted there were vital changes in the ways in which ore was prepared for smelting and in the smelting process itself.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.164</ref>\n\n===Bole smelting===\n\nThe traditional [[smelter]] was a ''bole'', a large fire built on a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as ''bing'' and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.<ref>D. Kiernan & R. Van de Noort 1992</ref>\n\n===Smelting mills===\n\nIn the late 16th century wind power was abandoned and the smelting blast was provided by a [[bellows]] driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by \u201cwhite coal\u201d, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to [[charcoal]] for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which would have made it difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. Draught for the furnaces came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.<ref>Crossley 1992</ref>\n\n===Dressing===\n\nBefore a miner could sell his ore he had to dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock in which it was embedded and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a ''bucker'' or, in larger mines, on a ''crushing circle'', where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a ''buddle'' or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.200</ref>\n[[File:minphot1.jpg|thumb|Remains of stone washing buddle at Perseverance Mine on Carsington Pasture]]\n\n==Mining customs==\n\nEverything about the old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole structure was designed to enable the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot4.jpg|thumb|Barmote Hall, Wirksworth]]\nIt was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called \"free mining\". Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant amount of ore was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to it as long as he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster's tenants at [[Brassington]] complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle.<ref>The National Archives, DL43/1/19, PFF 1322.</ref>  In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1 shilling, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, 166M/M1.</ref> But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.\n\n===King's farmers and chief barmasters===\n\nThe coveted and valuable farm of the Duchy of Lancaster's right to the lead mine duties, coupled as it was with the office of chief barmaster, endowed its owner with both a considerable income and authority over the running of the industry. It was always resold at a much higher price than that charged by the Duchy, which was  \u00a3110 plus annual payments of \u00a372 for the duties and \u00a31-6-8d for the barmastership.<ref name=\"Slack_a\"/>\n\n===Chief barmasters and the 24===\n\nAt dinner in Wirksworth after meetings of the 17th-century Barmote Court, the landlord of the inn had three tables for those attending the Court.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/28/2a.</ref> There was the \"24 table\", where the members of the 24-man jury sat, and where he charged 8d per head, \"the barmasters' table\", at 10d a head, and a table where \"gentlemen's dinners\" cost 1 shilling each. The gentlemen drank sack or [[claret]] with their dinner; the men were served with beer. The bill was paid by the king's farmer and chief barmaster. There were usually about a dozen gentlemen, some of whom were members of the jury, while others were there to present a case to the Court. Also among the gentlemen were the steward of the court, who was a lawyer and who conducted the sessions. When the chief barmaster for the Wapentake, always a man of wealth and rank, was a local gentleman such as Sir John Gell of Hopton<ref name=\"Slack_a\" /> or his son John, the 2nd baronet, he often attended the Court himself. If the current chief barmaster was an absentee member of the gentry or nobility he relied on his deputy barmasters.\n\nIn addition to helping the barmasters to carry out their duties the 24 jurors brought practical experience to bear when the Barmote Court was adjudicating in disputes and trials. The main requirement of the jurymen was that they should be knowledgeable in mining matters and they included both working miners and, when it was thought necessary, local gentry.\n\n===Deputy barmasters===\n\nThe deputy barmasters whom the chief barmaster appointed were experienced local men. Some of them were yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen.<ref>Slack 1991</ref>  The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much of the business of the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required them to be able to read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it was measured by the dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as ''lot''. This was the barmaster's ''reckoning''. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called ''cope''.\n\n===Giving a mine===\n\nThe barmaster or his deputy granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was ''grove'' or ''groove'', on receipt of proof that it was viable. The proof was a standard container, a dish, filled with about {{convert|65|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of ore from the mine in question. Every dish was calibrated by the barmaster twice a year against a brass standard dish. The miner thus granted title to the mine was said to have ''freed'' it, either ''for old'' if a development in an existing mine, or ''for new'' in the case of a new discovery. He was given permission to work 2 ''meers'' of ground, known as ''founder meers'', with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, ''taker meers'', along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his ''possessions'' or ''stows'' (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to ''wind'' the ore from the shaft). A meer was {{convert|29|yd|m}}, in the Wirksworth Wapentake.\n\nSince the course of a vein of lead was unpredictable, there were many disputes caused by one group of miners following a vein into another mine. There were occasions when possession was disputed by physical means.\n\n===Title-holding and record keeping===\n\nThe deputy barmasters were responsible for settling disputes over ownership or of ''arresting'' or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left unworked. They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to ''nick'' the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: \"Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte.\"<ref>National Archive DL 30/54/669A</ref>\n\nThe deputy barmasters kept records of all changes of title and of the amounts of ore measured and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular ''reckonings'' at the mines. The lot and cope ''accounts'' involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, the name of the miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the amount of ore mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the amount of ore sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/58/24</ref> Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives \"to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\">Derbyshire Record Office D258/30/16-24</ref> Many of their records have survived.\n\n===Accidents===\n\nIn conjunction with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner in the case of fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in Throstle Nest mine.\n\n<blockquote>Wirksworth Wapentake March 26th 1761.\nWe, whose names are under written, being this day summoned by Mr. Edward Ashton, Bar-Master for the Liberty of Brassington, to a groove called by the name of Throstle Nest on Brassington Pasture; to enquire into the cause of the death of T.W. now lying before us; accordingly we have been down the shaft to the Foot thereof, and down one sump or turn to the foot thereof, and on a gate North-wardly about sixteen yards to the Forefield, where the deceased had been at work; and by the information of William Briddon who was working near him; it appears that a large stone fell upon him out of the roof, and it is our opinions the said stone was the cause of his death.<ref>Hardy 1762</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:minphot2.jpg|thumb|Datestone of TW, the miner killed in Throstlenest Mine in 1761, carved on limestone outcrop a few feet from the mineshaft]]\n\n===Structure of industry===\n\nThe free mining arrangement under the rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy's lessee of the mineral rights at the end of the 16th century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land.<ref>Wood 1999, p.207</ref> Shrewsbury's success embedded the old rules and facilitated free mining.\n\nThere was one independent area within the Wapentake, Griffe Grange, near Brassington, held by the Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/53/3a,b,c</ref> The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/20/7/1-40</ref> Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him \"to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\" /> This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.\n\nFor historical reasons the structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues.<ref>Wood 1999, pp.238\u2013248</ref> The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.\n\nThe operation of the old rules and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent the development of a complicated structure there. The barmasters' ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters' accounts for 1653<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/28/20c</ref> show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden's Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called \"cavers\".\n\n==Pollution==\n\nLead is poisonous to both plants and animals. For people the smelting processes are the most dangerous \u2013 the restored smelter at Spitewinter, near Chesterfield, stands a few yards from Belland Lane, ''belland'' being lead poisoning. The current owners of the smelter on the site of the former Mill Close mine at Darley Bridge have bought much of the adjoining land and turned arable and pasture into woodland, to avoid the danger to crops and animals.\n\nThe danger to plants and animals, particularly from washing or \"buddling\", has been known for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. \"For buddling ... I have heard that miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them.\"<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6681, ff140-141 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref>\n\nIn 1794 several groups of Wensley miners who had buddled mine waste in the river Derwent above and below Darley Bridge were brought to court, accused of polluting the river.<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6676, ff132-160 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> Witnesses described the river as being muddied as far down-river as a mile below Cromford Bridge, and a Matlock publican claimed to have been prevented from his usual practice of using river water for his brewing by the state of the Derwent. He had had to sink a well to stay in business. Mining law was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into \"some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)\" to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine \u2013 their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent \u2013 lost their case.\n[[File:minphot3.jpg|thumb|Settling pond for washing sludge at Corsehill Mine, Brassington]]\nIn addition to the mining law to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations \u2013 there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas as well as the recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills were provided with chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.157</ref>  Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.\n\n==Mine drainage==\n\nUntil the 17th century mining had usually been abandoned when the work reached the water table. Efforts at draining lead mines by horse-powered pumps, or \u201cengines\u201d, had little success. In the later years of the industry mines were successfully drained by hydraulic, steam, internal combustion and electric power, but the first successes were achieved by soughs, drainage tunnels driven into flooded veins to allow the water to run off.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987</ref> Dr Rieuwerts has provided a comprehensive gazetteer of the Derbyshire lead mining soughs. By lowering the water table and opening up large new deposits of lead ore, they transformed the industry.\n\nThe first [[sough]], designed by Sir [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], knighted for his work in draining the East Anglian fens, was driven over a twenty-year period from a point on Cromford Hill, between [[Cromford]] and [[Wirksworth]], into an area called the Dovegang. When it was completed in 1652 there was an immediate jump in ore production in the area. Vermuyden's was followed by a succession of soughs which by the end of the century had drained enough of the mines in the Wirksworth Wapentake to cause a dramatic rise in production in the whole area. The most important were the Cromford Sough, which was over thirty years in driving, between 1662 and 1696, and was continued in the 18th century, and Hannage Sough, begun in 1693 and also continued into the next century. The Cromford Sough provided the power for [[Richard Arkwright]]'s mills at Cromford, the first of which was built in 1771. Also among the important 17th century soughs were the Raventor, begun in 1655, Bates (1657\u201384), Lees (1664), and Baileycroft (1667\u201373). The Baileycroft Sough drained mines in Wirksworth. Those in the area just to the north of Wirksworth called the Gulf were drained by the Raventor and Lees Soughs. The Bates and Cromford Soughs drained mines on Cromford Moor \u2014 Bates Sough had reached the Dovegang by 1684. Hannage Sough drained the area to the east of Yokecliffe Rake, on the south of Wirksworth.\n\nDrainage of the mines in the whole of the Wirksworth area was eventually accomplished by the Meerbrook Sough, begun at the level of the river Derwent in 1772, at a time when lead-mining ventures had become only intermittently profitable. The entrance to this sough is {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=off}} high and has a keystone inscribed \u201cFH 1772\u201d. FH was Francis Hurt of Alderwasley, smelter, lead mine shareholder, iron-master and the main shareholder in the sough. It still discharges {{convert|12|e6impgal|m3}} to {{convert|20|e6impgal|m3}} a day, and by the 1830s had so reduced the flow from the Cromford Sough that in 1846 Richard Arkwright's successor had to end production at the Cromford mills.<ref>Cooper, B. 1983, p.78</ref>\nIn other areas the Mill Close mines between Winster and Wensley, and the mines of Youlgreave were soughed.\n\n==Cupola smelting ==\n\nThe mills which had superseded the ancient bolehills in the late 16th century, a development described above, were themselves superseded in the 18th century by the gradual introduction of a new type of furnace known as the [[Reverberatory furnace|cupola]].<ref>Willies 1990</ref>\n\nThe old mills had a number of disadvantages. Their characteristic overheating and dissemination of polluting fumes made it necessary to close the smelter down at the end of each day's work. The hearth burned out quickly and regular weekly repairs or rebuilding were necessary \u2013 between 24 June and 29 September 1657, for instance, thirteen new hearths were required at the Upper Mill in [[Wirksworth]].<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/61/49b.</ref> Water-powered smelting mills were restricted to riverside sites and \u201cwhite coal\u201d fuel required a good supply of timber. By the 18th century timber supplies were running out and, where [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or coal was used because of timber shortages, impurities, particularly sulphur, were introduced into the lead. It was, finally, less efficient than the cupola.\n\nThe cupola was a [[reverberatory furnace]]. The fuel was burned in a combustion chamber at the side of the furnace, separate from the \u201ccharge\u201d of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the cupola's greater efficiency than the smelting mill. Unlike the smelting mill, the cupola could be operated continuously. Since the air flow over the ore was less powerful than that from the bellows of the blast furnace fewer lead particles were blown away. Further lead was saved by the fact that since the fuel and the charge were separate none of the lead was lost into the ash. Since no water power was needed the cupola had a fourth theoretical advantage of being freed from the riverside location of the blast furnace, and able to be placed in the most convenient site for supply of ore and coal. However, the higher temperatures needed to melt the slag recovered from the primary melt required a water-powered furnace and, since slag mills tended to be placed next to the cupolas, most cupolas remained in riverside sites.\n\nMany cupolas had long horizontal flues, which were introduced to trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of the flue could also be recovered for resmelting.\n\n==Closure==\n\nThe Derbyshire lead industry declined after the late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production costs and the discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by import duty in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845<ref>6 Geo IV c104 & 8 & 9 Vic. c.90 respectively (quoted in Burt,1984, p.235)</ref> brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry's decline.\n\nThere were still bursts of high production, and indeed the output of certain mines during the 18th and 19th centuries exceeded anything achieved in the 17th century; over 2658 loads (about 641 [[long ton|ton]]s or 651 [[tonne|metric tonnes]]) were mined at Brassington, traditionally an area of low output, in 1862.<ref>Chatsworth House. Barmaster's Collection. Transcript Roger Flindall</ref>  At a meeting of the Barmote Court in Wirksworth in 1862 one mine owner announced \"that by perseverance for upwards of twenty years, they had at last found the long sought for treasure, which he hoped would be prosperous, and they should be able to continue employing, as they are at the present time, upwards of 100 men at one mine in Brassington\".<ref>''Derby & Chesterfield Reporter'', 2 May 1862, p.8, col.6</ref>  However, by 1901 the number of men employed in all the Derbyshire lead mines had fallen to 285<ref>Ford, TD and Rieuwerts, JH, 2000, p.60</ref> most of whom worked at the [[Mill Close Mine]] at Darley Bridge. Mill Close, the biggest lead mine in the country, took the Derbyshire lead industry into the 20th century, and just before its enforced closure in 1939, caused by flooding, employed about 600 men.<ref>Willies 1989</ref> The smelter at Mill Close, established in 1934, was bought in 1941 by H J Enthoven and Sons, a London-based lead producer, and still operates.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Derbyshire}}\n* [[Odin Mine]]\n* [[Beans and Bacon mine]]\n* [[Peak District Mining Museum]]\n* [[Killhope Wheel]], Lead Mining Museum, Co.

In 1850, he secured Office for the term of 1850-1852 wherein he served in the State of California Assembly.

They founded a publishing house, ''Saint Germain Press'', to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States.  These training sessions and \"Conclaves\" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge.<ref>''The Voice of the \"I AM\"'' Number 1, March 1936.

The meeting included teachings they described as being received directly from the Ascended Masters. They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n=== Guy Ballard's death ===\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Guy Ballard died from arteriosclerosis at 5:00 A.M. on December 29, 1939, in Los Angeles, in the home of his son Donald. On December 31 his body was cremated. On New Year's Day during the annual ''Christmas Class'', Edna Ballard stated that Guy had completed his Ascension at midnight December 31, 1939, from the \"Royal Teton Retreat\".<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nStudents of the \"I Am\" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The \"I AM\" activity believe ''Ascension'' can mean [[Entering heaven alive]], that is, to \"raise one's body\"\u2014physically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions.  Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation.<ref>\"War on High\" -- Interview with [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Gnosis'' magazine No. 21 Fall 1991 Pages 32-37</ref> Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined \"Ascension\" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced \"51% of one's [[karma]]\".<ref>Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--\"Ascension--the Goal of Life\" Page 51</ref> This modified and more practical definition of \"ascension\" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.\n\n=== Copyright infringement civil action ===\n\nIn 1941, the Ballards were sued for copyright infringement by the family and estate of Frederick Spencer Oliver (1866-1899), \"amenuensis\" of the novel ''[[A Dweller on Two Planets]]'', first published in 1905. The suit was dismissed for failure to state cause of action. District Judge Dawkins quoted the original foreword to Oliver's book in its entirety, wherein Oliver emphasized that he was not the author but had [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeled]] the book from the spirit of a previously deceased person with the intent of preserving and conveying the story and teachings of that person's world; and the book had been copyrighted with Oliver as a proprietor, not as the author. Judge Dawkins pointed out that the Ballards had stated they were using similar methods to write their books and that this in itself wasn't enough to uphold the action in court.<ref>''[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/41/296/2374357/ Oliver v.

The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty.<ref name=\"scotus\"/><ref name=\"scotus\" /><ref name=\"lamag\"/> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].  In ''[[United States v. Ballard]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction.  Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that \"the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court.\"<ref>''Cohen v. United States'', 297 F.2d 760 (1962)</ref>\n\nOn a second appeal, the Supreme Court in 1946 vacated the fraud conviction, on the grounds that women were improperly excluded from the jury panel.<ref name=\"supreme.justia.com\">[http://supreme.justia.com/us/329/187/case.html ''Ballard v.

It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master [[Count of St. Germain|St. Germain]] is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same [[Freemasons|Masonic Lodge]] as [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis.<ref>Folkloric accounts collected in Raymond Bernard's ''Great Secret Count St Germain'' (Mokelumne Hill Press, 1993)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe movement teaches that the omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent creator God ('I AM' \u2013 Exodus 3:14) is in all of us as a spark from the Divine Flame, and that we can experience this presence, love, power and light \u2013 and its power of the Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love \u2013 through quiet contemplation and by repeating 'affirmations' and 'decrees'.  By affirming something one desires, one may cause it to happen.<ref name=\"barrett\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe group teaches that the \"Mighty I AM Presence\" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the \"Violet Flame\" is generated by the \"I AM Presence\" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the \"Presence\" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life.<ref><http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_01_MightyIAM.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190313051934/http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_01_MightyIAM.html |date=March 13, 2019 }}></ref>\n\nThe spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self-purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the \"I AM Presence\": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, invocations and affirmations; and external practices such as \"decrees\" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction), all of which are said to amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes.<ref name=\"UnivVirginia\"/>\nMembers believe there is actual science behind decrees and affirmations and claim these practices are acknowledged by medicine as effective.<ref>Your Body Believes Every Word You Say - Barbara Hoberman Levine, Hung By The Tongue - Francis P Martin; Healing Words -[[Larry Dossey]], M.D., 5 Common Words That Create Failure -Geoffrey James</ref>\n\nThe group also emphasizes personal freedom, embracing patriotic symbols, rendering honor to America giving the Pledge of Allegiance and the American\u2019s Creed and always displaying  American flags in its Temples or other offices.<ref name=\"UnivVirginia\"/>\n\nThese \"positive thinking\" beliefs overlap with several other New Age movements such as [[Religious Science]] and the [[Human Potential Movement]].<ref name=\"barrett\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ascended master]]\n* [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|Exaltation]] \n* [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]\n* [[Robert LeFevre]]\n* [[Mirra Alfassa]]\n* [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|Supermind]]\n* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]\n* [[I Am that I Am]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Partial bibliography==\n\n* Saint Germain Foundation.

Ballard was well-read in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and its offshoots, and while hiking on [[Mount Shasta]] looking for a rumored branch of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] known as \"The Brotherhood of Mount Shasta\", he claimed to have met and been instructed by a man who introduced himself as \"Saint Germain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Godfr\u00e9 Ray |year=1935 |orig-year=1934 |title=Unveiled Mysteries |url=https://archive.org/stream/02TheMagicPresenceByGodfrRayKing1935FirstEdition/%2301%20-%20Unveiled%20Mysteries%2C%20by%20Godfr%C3%A9%20Ray%20King%20-%201935%20-Second%20Edition#page/n1 |publisher=Saint Germain Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |edition=Second |chapter=1: Meeting the Master |pages=1-32 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]] is regular component of theosophical religions as an Ascended Master, based on the historical [[Comte de Saint-Germain]], an 18th-century adventurer.<ref name=\"barrett\">{{cite book|title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/sectscultsaltern00barr}}</ref>\n  \nThe Ballards said they began talking to the Ascended Masters regularly.  They founded a publishing house, ''Saint Germain Press'', to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States.  These training sessions and \"Conclaves\" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge.<ref>''The Voice of the \"I AM\"'' Number 1, March 1936.

They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n=== Guy Ballard's death ===\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Guy Ballard died from arteriosclerosis at 5:00 A.M. on December 29, 1939, in Los Angeles, in the home of his son Donald. On December 31 his body was cremated. On New Year's Day during the annual ''Christmas Class'', Edna Ballard stated that Guy had completed his Ascension at midnight December 31, 1939, from the \"Royal Teton Retreat\".<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nStudents of the \"I Am\" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The \"I AM\" activity believe ''Ascension'' can mean [[Entering heaven alive]], that is, to \"raise one's body\"\u2014physically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions.  Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation.<ref>\"War on High\" -- Interview with [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Gnosis'' magazine No. 21 Fall 1991 Pages 32-37</ref> Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined \"Ascension\" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced \"51% of one's [[karma]]\".<ref>Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--\"Ascension--the Goal of Life\" Page 51</ref> This modified and more practical definition of \"ascension\" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.\n\n=== Copyright infringement civil action ===\n\nIn 1941, the Ballards were sued for copyright infringement by the family and estate of Frederick Spencer Oliver (1866-1899), \"amenuensis\" of the novel ''[[A Dweller on Two Planets]]'', first published in 1905. The suit was dismissed for failure to state cause of action. District Judge Dawkins quoted the original foreword to Oliver's book in its entirety, wherein Oliver emphasized that he was not the author but had [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeled]] the book from the spirit of a previously deceased person with the intent of preserving and conveying the story and teachings of that person's world; and the book had been copyrighted with Oliver as a proprietor, not as the author. Judge Dawkins pointed out that the Ballards had stated they were using similar methods to write their books and that this in itself wasn't enough to uphold the action in court.<ref>''[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/41/296/2374357/ Oliver v.

The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty.<ref name=\"scotus\"/><ref name=\"scotus\" /><ref name=\"lamag\"/> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].  In ''[[United States v. Ballard]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction.  Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that \"the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court.\"<ref>''Cohen v. United States'', 297 F.2d 760 (1962)</ref>\n\nOn a second appeal, the Supreme Court in 1946 vacated the fraud conviction, on the grounds that women were improperly excluded from the jury panel.<ref name=\"supreme.justia.com\">[http://supreme.justia.com/us/329/187/case.html ''Ballard v.

It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master [[Count of St. Germain|St. Germain]] is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same [[Freemasons|Masonic Lodge]] as [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis.<ref>Folkloric accounts collected in Raymond Bernard's ''Great Secret Count St Germain'' (Mokelumne Hill Press, 1993)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe movement teaches that the omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent creator God ('I AM' \u2013 Exodus 3:14) is in all of us as a spark from the Divine Flame, and that we can experience this presence, love, power and light \u2013 and its power of the Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love \u2013 through quiet contemplation and by repeating 'affirmations' and 'decrees'.  By affirming something one desires, one may cause it to happen.<ref name=\"barrett\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe group teaches that the \"Mighty I AM Presence\" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the \"Violet Flame\" is generated by the \"I AM Presence\" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the \"Presence\" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life.<ref><http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_01_MightyIAM.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190313051934/http://www.saintgermainfoundation.org/SGF_01_MightyIAM.html |date=March 13, 2019 }}></ref>\n\nThe spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self-purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the \"I AM Presence\": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, invocations and affirmations; and external practices such as \"decrees\" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction), all of which are said to amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes.<ref name=\"UnivVirginia\"/>\nMembers believe there is actual science behind decrees and affirmations and claim these practices are acknowledged by medicine as effective.<ref>Your Body Believes Every Word You Say - Barbara Hoberman Levine, Hung By The Tongue - Francis P Martin; Healing Words -[[Larry Dossey]], M.D., 5 Common Words That Create Failure -Geoffrey James</ref>\n\nThe group also emphasizes personal freedom, embracing patriotic symbols, rendering honor to America giving the Pledge of Allegiance and the American\u2019s Creed and always displaying  American flags in its Temples or other offices.<ref name=\"UnivVirginia\"/>\n\nThese \"positive thinking\" beliefs overlap with several other New Age movements such as [[Religious Science]] and the [[Human Potential Movement]].<ref name=\"barrett\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ascended master]]\n* [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|Exaltation]] \n* [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]\n* [[Robert LeFevre]]\n* [[Mirra Alfassa]]\n* [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|Supermind]]\n* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]\n* [[I Am that I Am]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Partial bibliography==\n\n* Saint Germain Foundation.

The College regulates the practice of medicine to protect and serve the public interest.

This system of self-regulation is based on the premise that the College must act first and foremost in the interest of the public. All doctors in Ontario must be members of the College in order to practise medicine in the province. The role of the College, as well as its authority and powers, are set out in the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA), the Health Professions Procedural Code under the RHPA and the Medicine Act.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe duties of the College include: issuing certificates of registration to doctors to allow them to practise medicine monitoring and maintaining standards of practice through peer assessment and remediation investigating complaints about doctors on behalf of the public, and conducting discipline hearings when doctors may have committed an act of professional misconduct or incompetence. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe College is governed by a council. The RHPA stipulates that it consist of at least 32 and no more than 34 members:\n16 physicians elected by their peers on a geographical basis every three years;  3 physicians appointed from among the six faculties of medicine (at the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[McMaster University]], [[University of Toronto]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Ottawa]], and the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]]); no fewer than 13 and no more than 15 non-physician or 'public' members appointed by the provincial government for terms decided by the government.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nBoth medical faculty members and public members may be re-appointed at the end of their terms.

A College staff member in the Investigations and Resolutions Department experienced in health care will help the caller. Staff may be able to answer questions about care, clarify which questions to take back to one's doctor, and/or answer questions about how the health care system works.  The caller's medical records may be reviewed and a discussion with the doctor in question will be scheduled. Staff will ask the doctor for a response.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nCollege staff may also arrange to meet with the individual who initiates the complaints process, and possibly with this individual and the doctor(s) \u2013 perhaps even hospital administrators \u2013 to communicate and clarify issues. This gives the individual who initiates the complaints process the opportunity to tell the doctor and others about any concerns.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThis process provides a forum for individuals to have their concerns heard and acknowledged by the doctor and/or hospital representatives, and is done only with both the patient and the doctor's agreement.

The college has been criticized for being more interested in protecting doctors than patients.\n\n===Block fees===\nBetween 2004 and 2011 the College prosecuted four physicians for improperly charging block fees to patients.  Block fees are annual fees charged by physicians to allow patients to access services.  Physicians are permitted to charge block fees to uninsured patients for services not covered by OHIP, but charging block fees to allow insured patients to access OHIP services is considered to be professional misconduct. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markcardwell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MP-Ont.-doc-fights-CPSO-Oct.-4-2011.pdf|title=Pediatrician fights CPSO over uninsured services}}</ref>\n\n=== The \"Transparency Project\" ===\nIn 2013, in response to some of the above criticisms, the College announced that it would begin its \"Transparency Project\".  The goal of the Transparency Project would be to make it easier for patients to gain more information about doctors who have been accused of wrongdoing. The College Council gave its support to a transparency initiative that had four categories.  One, an increase in the transparency of the transfer of patient medical records.  Two, a proposal that the Notices of Hearing for the College's Discipline Proceedings be posted to a physician's profile on the public register.  Third, a proposal that the status of discipline matters as they are proceeding be added to a physician's profile on the public register.  Fourth, that reinstatement decisions in their entirety be posted to a physician's profile on the public register.\n\n===Complaint disposal times===\nIn recent years the College has struggled to process an increasing volume of complaints about physicians, probably because patients\u2019 expectations are increasing rather than physicians getting worse.  In 2007 it successfully lobbied the Ontario Ministry of Health to increase the time limit for disposal of complaints from 120 to 150 days, and to give itself increased powers to extend those time limits.  These proposals were contained in amendments to the Regulated Health Professions Act 1991 which were passed by the Ontario Legislative Assembly in 2007 and came into force in 2009.  The time taken to dispose of complaints continued to lengthen until the Ontario Ministry of\nHealth commissioned a report, \u201cStreamlining the Physician Complaints Process in Ontario\u201d which reported in 2016 that \u201cMore time and money is spent on a disposition in Ontario than in other jurisdictions, with little apparent benefit to the public in terms of better or safer physician services\u201d, \u201ctoo many complaints and investigations are in the system too long\u201d, and \u201cthe 150 day deadline is not met on many occasions\u201d <ref>[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/ministry/publications/reports/physician_complaints/docs/physician_complaints_process_en.pdf Streamlining the Physician Complaints Process in Ontario.

Following this report, the College improved the efficiency of its complaints procedures, including routing suitable complaints via an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process, and disposal times are once again coming down.\n\n===\u201cNever reapply\u201d undertakings===\nA novel solution adopted by the College to the problem of delays in resolving complaints has been to make increasing use of \u201cnever reapply\u201d undertakings.  A \u201cnever reapply\u201d undertaking is an undertaking made by a physician to surrender his or her licence and never reapply for another licence in Ontario or anywhere else in the world.  In return, the College promises not to proceed with the complaint, the investigation is terminated and the file closed.  These undertakings are probably legally unenforceable both inside and outside Ontario as they would amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade <ref>[http://www.danielnelson.ca/pdfs/Non-Competition%20Agreements%20and%20Restraint%20of%20Trade.pdf Memorandum, \u201cNon-Competition Agreements And Restraint Of Trade\u201d.  Daniel A. Nelson, 21 July 2009.]</ref> and they are rarely used by other medical regulatory authorities.  In the past, such undertakings were only used in the most serious cases, for example sexual abuse of a patient, but they are increasingly being used by the College as a way of disposing of less serious or unspecified complaints.  The following chart shows the expansion of the use of \u201cnever reapply\u201d undertakings between 1994 and 2019.  A disadvantage of these undertakings are that they remove physicians from practice who may be able and willing to continue practicing but just wish to terminate the investigation.\n\n[[File:CPSO Never Reapply undertakings 1994-2019.jpg]]\n\nThis data was extracted from the CPSO online public register by a combination of electronic and manual searching.

The College regulates the practice of medicine to protect and serve the public interest. It issues certificates of registration to doctors to allow them to practise medicine, monitors and maintains standards of practice through peer assessment and remediation, investigates complaints against doctors on behalf of the public, and disciplines doctors who may have committed an act of professional misconduct or incompetence.<ref name=star3>{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Laura |url= https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/18/mississauga_doctor_sees_maleonly_patients_after_sexual_abuse_discipline.html#\n |title=Mississauga doctor sees male-only patients after sexual abuse discipline |work=Toronto Star |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe medical profession has been granted a great degree of authority by provincial law, and that authority is exercised through the College. This system of self-regulation is based on the premise that the College must act first and foremost in the interest of the public. All doctors in Ontario must be members of the College in order to practise medicine in the province. The role of the College, as well as its authority and powers, are set out in the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA), the Health Professions Procedural Code under the RHPA and the Medicine Act.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe duties of the College include: issuing certificates of registration to doctors to allow them to practise medicine monitoring and maintaining standards of practice through peer assessment and remediation investigating complaints about doctors on behalf of the public, and conducting discipline hearings when doctors may have committed an act of professional misconduct or incompetence. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe College is governed by a council. The RHPA stipulates that it consist of at least 32 and no more than 34 members:\n16 physicians elected by their peers on a geographical basis every three years;  3 physicians appointed from among the six faculties of medicine (at the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[McMaster University]], [[University of Toronto]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Ottawa]], and the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]]); no fewer than 13 and no more than 15 non-physician or 'public' members appointed by the provincial government for terms decided by the government.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nBoth medical faculty members and public members may be re-appointed at the end of their terms. The College President is elected from and by Council and serves a one-year term.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nCouncil members sit on one or more committees of the College. Each committee has specific functions, most of which are governed by provincial legislation. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nGeneral Council meetings are held four times a year, at which time the activities of the College are reviewed and matters of general policy are debated and voted on.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nMeetings of Council are open to the public and are held in the 3rd floor Council Chamber at 80 College Street, Toronto, Ontario.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn October 2008, the College was named one of \"[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine. Later that month, the College was also named one of [[Greater Toronto's Top Employers]], which was announced by the [[Toronto Star]] newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-college-of-physicians-and-surgeons-of-ontario|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}</ref>\n\n===Complaints process===\nThe complaints process regarding physicians begins with a phone call to the Public Advisory Department at 416-967-2603 or 1-800-268-7096, extension 603. A College staff member in the Investigations and Resolutions Department experienced in health care will help the caller. Staff may be able to answer questions about care, clarify which questions to take back to one's doctor, and/or answer questions about how the health care system works.  The caller's medical records may be reviewed and a discussion with the doctor in question will be scheduled. Staff will ask the doctor for a response.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nCollege staff may also arrange to meet with the individual who initiates the complaints process, and possibly with this individual and the doctor(s) \u2013 perhaps even hospital administrators \u2013 to communicate and clarify issues. This gives the individual who initiates the complaints process the opportunity to tell the doctor and others about any concerns.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThis process provides a forum for individuals to have their concerns heard and acknowledged by the doctor and/or hospital representatives, and is done only with both the patient and the doctor's agreement. Occasionally, an improvement to the way in which health care is delivered has come about as a result of these discussions.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Criticisms associated with the college==\n\n===Cautions===\nBetween 2007 and 2013 the College issued more than 1,000 \"cautions\" against practicing doctors.<ref name=star2>{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Theresa |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2013/07/02/college_of_physicians_and_surgeons_wants_more_transparency_about_doctor_discipline.html |title=College of Physicians and Surgeons wants more transparency about doctor discipline |work=Toronto Star |date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>  Cautions are issued to doctors for transgressions that include providing inadequate treatment, poor record-keeping and raising voices in arguments.
