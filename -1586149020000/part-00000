However, his daughter, [[Shelly Marsh|Shelly]], has a \"marijuana problem\". She believes it smells bad and makes people \"dumber than they already are.\" Randy tries to convince her of the positive benefits of marijuana, but the obstinate Shelly wishes it were illegal again. Randy takes Shelly to an exhibit of [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifacts at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]], having promised her a father\u2013daughter outing during which they could bond, but when he attempts to draw attention to the fact that the ancient Egyptians used [[hemp]] rope, she is angered to realize that the trip was another attempt to bring her to his way of thinking about marijuana.\n\nMeanwhile, fourth grader [[Butters Stotch]] tours the same exhibit as part of his efforts to complete the exhibit's accompanying sticker stamp book. When he comes to the mummy of Egyptian royal Took-Tan-ra, an [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mechanic|elderly museum employee]] warns him that this mummy harbors an \"ancient love curse\", and urges him not to put Took-Tan-ra's stamp in his book. Butters ignores the warning, after which the [[undead]] mummy of Took-Tan-ra visits Butters in his bedroom one night. Initially horrified at the rampaging monster, Butters then sees that he merely wants to hug Butters and give him a [[FitBit]] device as a gift. The grateful Butters informs Took-Tan-ra that he already has one, and will give this new one to a friend, but Took-Tan-ra is enraged and storms out. After the mummy's rampage results in five deaths and property damage, the police visit Butters and relate that the mummy told them about the \"argument\" he had with Butters. Butters is astounded that the mummy spoke to the police, who admonish Butters for his \"hurtful\" conduct toward Took-Tan-ra. When Butters tells them that he may have been cursed by the mummy, but the police say that Took-Tan-ra told them the reverse. They also inform Butters that he must share in the damages caused by the mummy's rampage, and issue him a summons, advising him and the mummy to stay away from each other.\n\nFollowing more attacks by the mummy, Butters meets with the school counselor, [[Mr. Mackey]], but is incredulous to learn that undead being has also spoken to Mackey, who expresses a sympathetic view of the creature. Butters later meets with his classmates at a fast food restaurant, and tells them that he needs to end the curse, pointing to the endless texts and selfies that Took-Tan-ra sends him, but his classmates, like everyone else, speak as if the fault lies with Butters, and advise him to break things off with him, even as the mummy shows up there to continue his campaign of harassment.\n\nShelly cooks a witch's brew, and recites an accompanying incantation that will grant her revenge. She dumps the brew onto the Halloween Special marijuana, horrifying Randy and his business partner, [[Towelie (character)|Towelie]]. This turns out to be an enhanced growth formula that increases Randy's yield. However, when he refuses to drive Shelly to a book fair on Halloween night, she destroys the packaged Halloween special, prompting Randy to ask the police to put her in jail for the night. She is placed in a cell with Butters, who has been imprisoned because he, not the mummy, \"manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive selfishness\".\n\nAt Randy's party, the revelers who smoke the Halloween Special mutate into monsters. Randy is then confronted by an undead [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], whom Randy murdered in the episode \"[[Band in China]]\". Other monsters follow, including an unseen [[Harvey Weinstein]], [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|who rapes Randy]] during his emergency phone call to the police. The police race to Tegridy Farms with Butters, in the hopes that he can use his powers of manipulation to stop the mummy, who they believe is causing the attacks there. However, the horrors Randy experiences are revealed to be a hallucination caused by the mutated marijuana. Shelly ends these hallucinations by brewing an antidote that she throws at Randy. The ranking policeman there, [[Sergeant Harrison Yates]], informs Butters that the mummy was not to blame for the emergency, prompting Butters apologizes to the mummy. The mummy resolves to leave for good, but before doing so, gives Butters a note written in [[hieroglyphics]] that translates as \"I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you.\" Randy awakens three days later, and when his wife, [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] says he was the only one who enjoyed the Halloween special, he says that he was pretty much the target audience anyway. He is also relieved that he did not really have anal sex with Harvey Weinstein, though he and the family are shocked to find a used condom that gives cause for them to question this.\n\n==Reception==\nJohn Hugar with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a rating of C+, calling it an \"uneven\" episode. He stated that the episode had strong potential but ultimately felt rushed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hugar|first1=John|title=Randy and Butters confront different types of monsters in an uneven South Park Halloween episode|url=https://tv.avclub.com/randy-and-butters-confront-different-types-of-monsters-1839488494|website=The A.V.

Butters later meets with his classmates at a fast food restaurant, and tells them that he needs to end the curse, pointing to the endless texts and selfies that Took-Tan-ra sends him, but his classmates, like everyone else, speak as if the fault lies with Butters, and advise him to break things off with him, even as the mummy shows up there to continue his campaign of harassment.\n\nShelly cooks a witch's brew, and recites an accompanying incantation that will grant her revenge. She dumps the brew onto the Halloween Special marijuana, horrifying Randy and his business partner, [[Towelie (character)|Towelie]]. This turns out to be an enhanced growth formula that increases Randy's yield. However, when he refuses to drive Shelly to a book fair on Halloween night, she destroys the packaged Halloween special, prompting Randy to ask the police to put her in jail for the night. She is placed in a cell with Butters, who has been imprisoned because he, not the mummy, \"manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive selfishness\".\n\nAt Randy's party, the revelers who smoke the Halloween Special mutate into monsters. Randy is then confronted by an undead [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], whom Randy murdered in the episode \"[[Band in China]]\". Other monsters follow, including an unseen [[Harvey Weinstein]], [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|who rapes Randy]] during his emergency phone call to the police. The police race to Tegridy Farms with Butters, in the hopes that he can use his powers of manipulation to stop the mummy, who they believe is causing the attacks there. However, the horrors Randy experiences are revealed to be a hallucination caused by the mutated marijuana. Shelly ends these hallucinations by brewing an antidote that she throws at Randy. The ranking policeman there, [[Sergeant Harrison Yates]], informs Butters that the mummy was not to blame for the emergency, prompting Butters apologizes to the mummy. The mummy resolves to leave for good, but before doing so, gives Butters a note written in [[hieroglyphics]] that translates as \"I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you.\" Randy awakens three days later, and when his wife, [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] says he was the only one who enjoyed the Halloween special, he says that he was pretty much the target audience anyway. He is also relieved that he did not really have anal sex with Harvey Weinstein, though he and the family are shocked to find a used condom that gives cause for them to question this.\n\n==Reception==\nJohn Hugar with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a rating of C+, calling it an \"uneven\" episode.

Some of these titles were given numbered limited edition releases which included multiple discs, information booklets, and collectible tin cases. Many of these releases went [[out of print]] and became sought-after collectibles.\n\nAnchor Bay Entertainment is also noted for the release of the [[Evil Dead|''Evil Dead'' film trilogy]] on DVD, in numerous editions. ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' for example, had been released in both a regular and limited edition set that featured the director's cut of the film. Since then, the director's cut has been re-released on 2 separate occasions in addition to a 2-disc \"Boomstick Edition\" of the film as well. Until Anchor Bay released ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' on VHS and DVD, it was previously unavailable on video from a major label.\n\nAlso among its more profitable releases has been [[George A. Romero]]'s [[Living Dead]] series. Anchor Bay Entertainment has distribution rights for the middle 2 films in the Romero [[tetralogy]]: ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', however, it has also distributed DVDs of the original film, ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', which is in the public domain. Like the ''Evil Dead'' trilogy, the \"Living Dead\" series has seen many editions of the films on DVD. ''Dawn of the Dead'' has itself seen several releases on DVD, the most extra feature-laden being the Ultimate Edition in late 2004. An \"Evil Dead\" 3-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD was released in December 2007.\n\n===Special interest===\nIn addition to feature films, Anchor Bay Entertainment distributed special interest titles, including children's video series, like ''[[Bobby's World]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''. Until 2008, they distributed ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' videos. ''Thomas'' has reached platinum-selling status and in 2004 ranks consistently on the [[Nielsen VideoScan|VideoScan ranking]] top 50 chart of children's weekly video sales. Lionsgate acquired the ''Thomas'' DVD titles after [[HIT Entertainment]] bought out the rights to ''Thomas''. Rights to the ''Thomas'' DVDs now belong to Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (through their deal with [[Mattel]], HIT's current parent company). The company also has a top market share for fitness videos such as the ''[[Crunch (exercise)|Crunch]]'' and ''[[For Dummies]]'' series. The company also distributes [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] events on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n===Production company===\nAs a full-fledged production company, they handle television syndication of ''Halloween'', ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers|Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (which they also hold the video rights to), and have recently entered in-house production and distribution of theatrical films.\n\n==Award==\nAnchor Bay Entertainment received a Special Achievement Award from the [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] in June 2002. Anchor Bay was recognized as one of the \"pioneers in DVD releases and home video entertainment\" and \"successful in releasing dramas, comedies, foreign films, children's programming, and most prominently [[B movie|genre film]]s.\" Cited as highlights of Anchor Bay's releases were \"the films of [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Studios]], the works of [[Werner Herzog]], [[Paul Verhoeven]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[John Woo]], [[Monte Hellman]] and [[Sam Raimi]]\".<ref name=award>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_of_Science_Fiction_Fantasy_And_Horror_Films_USA/2002#Special_Award|title=2002 Special Award|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Past names==\n*Video Treasures\n*Starmaker Entertainment\n*MNTEX Entertainment\n*Teal Entertainment\n*Burbank Video\n*Drive Entertainment\n*GTS Records\n*Starz Home Entertainment\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films released by Anchor Bay Entertainment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.anchorbayent.com Official U.S. website]\n* [http://www.anchorbay.co.uk Official U.K. website]\n* [http://anchorbayent.com.au Official Australian website]\n* {{IMDb company|0209315|Anchor Bay Entertainment (Australia)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0113373|Anchor Bay Entertainment (U.K.)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0067793|Anchor Bay Entertainment (U.S.)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0249289|Anchor Bay Films}}\n* {{IMDb company|0053518|Video Treasures}}\n* {{IMDb company|0084780|Starmaker Entertainment}}\n* {{IMDb company|0015547|Starmaker Video}}\n* {{IMDb company|0015547|The Starmaker Group}}\n\n{{Lionsgate}}\n\n[[Category:Home video companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:Former Liberty Media subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Troy, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1985]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 2017]]\n[[Category:1985 establishments in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Starz Entertainment Group]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:The Weinstein Company]]\n[[Category:2017 disestablishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American home entertainment and production company}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Starmaker Entertainment|StarMaker Interactive}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Anchor Bay Entertainment\n| logo = Anchor Bay Entertainment.png\n| logo_size = 250px Final logo\n| fate = Folded into [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]\n| former_name = Video Treasures (1985\u20131995)\n| type = Subsidiary\n| industry = Home video, [[television syndication]], motion pictures\n| successor = [[Anchor Bay Films]]<br>[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1985}} (as Video Treasures)<br>{{start date and age|1995}} (as Anchor Bay Entertainment)\n| defunct = {{Start date and age|2017}} (Original)\n| location = [[Beverly Hills, California]]\n| key_people = \n| products = [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], [[Laserdisc]], [[VHS]]\n| owner = [[Lionsgate]]\n| parent = [[Starz Inc.|Starz]]\n| homepage = http://anchorbayent.com/\n}}\n'''Anchor Bay Entertainment''' (formerly '''Video Treasures'''), was an [[United States|American]] home entertainment and production company.

The transactions involved the purported sale of slow-moving or obsolete inventory to business partners coupled with secret buy-back provisions. The inventory included worthless video boxes and sleeves and DVDs for films. Handleman subsequently restated its financial statements to correct these accounting errors.

SHE announced on June 19, 2007, that it will be releasing high-definition versions of its films exclusively in the [[Blu-ray]] format. In 2008, Starz Media reinstated the ''Anchor Bay Entertainment'' brand, and all current releases bear this name. Many of the company's past cult titles have gone out of print, although some have been reissued by [[Blue Underground]].\n\nOn January 4, 2011, Starz, LLC sold 25% of Starz Media to [[The Weinstein Company]], which rendered Anchor Bay the de facto video distributor of films made by TWC and [[Dimension Films|Dimension]].<ref name=\"Deadline 2011-1-4\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2011/01/weinsteins-buy-25-stake-in-starz-media/|title=Weinsteins Buy 25% Stake In Starz Media|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Starz later bought back the Weinstein's stake in October 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investors.lionsgate.com/|title=IR Home|website=Investors.lionsgate.com|accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref> with Anchor Bay continuing to release TWC and Dimension video releases. \n\nIn early 2015, Anchor Bay UK (alongside Manga Entertainment UK) was bought from Starz by managing director Colin Lomax and renamed to Platform Entertainment.

The company's first-ever release on DVD was ''[[The Car]]'' in April 1997,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdloc8.com/viewbydistributor.php?sort=release&order=0&distributorid=174&num=1&region=all|work=DVDloc: The Internet DVD Database|title=Discs Released by Anchor Bay Entertainment|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> followed by ''[[Elvira, Mistress of the Dark]]'' that August, and a director's cut of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' in November 1997. The company's next release was ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' in February 1998.<ref>Catalogue listings state that ''Prom Night'' was released by Anchor Bay on February 18, 1998.</ref>\n\nIt also released ''Halloween'' (as well as its 3rd and 4th sequels), ''[[Sleepaway Camp]]'', ''[[Alice, Sweet Alice]]'', ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', ''[[Suspiria]]'', ''[[Maniac (1980 film)|Maniac]]'', the first 3 ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' films, ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'', ''[[Children of the Corn (1984 film)|Children of the Corn]]'', ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' and several other [[Lucio Fulci]] films. Some of these titles were given numbered limited edition releases which included multiple discs, information booklets, and collectible tin cases. Many of these releases went [[out of print]] and became sought-after collectibles.\n\nAnchor Bay Entertainment is also noted for the release of the [[Evil Dead|''Evil Dead'' film trilogy]] on DVD, in numerous editions. ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' for example, had been released in both a regular and limited edition set that featured the director's cut of the film. Since then, the director's cut has been re-released on 2 separate occasions in addition to a 2-disc \"Boomstick Edition\" of the film as well. Until Anchor Bay released ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' on VHS and DVD, it was previously unavailable on video from a major label.\n\nAlso among its more profitable releases has been [[George A. Romero]]'s [[Living Dead]] series. Anchor Bay Entertainment has distribution rights for the middle 2 films in the Romero [[tetralogy]]: ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', however, it has also distributed DVDs of the original film, ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', which is in the public domain. Like the ''Evil Dead'' trilogy, the \"Living Dead\" series has seen many editions of the films on DVD. ''Dawn of the Dead'' has itself seen several releases on DVD, the most extra feature-laden being the Ultimate Edition in late 2004. An \"Evil Dead\" 3-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD was released in December 2007.\n\n===Special interest===\nIn addition to feature films, Anchor Bay Entertainment distributed special interest titles, including children's video series, like ''[[Bobby's World]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''. Until 2008, they distributed ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' videos. ''Thomas'' has reached platinum-selling status and in 2004 ranks consistently on the [[Nielsen VideoScan|VideoScan ranking]] top 50 chart of children's weekly video sales. Lionsgate acquired the ''Thomas'' DVD titles after [[HIT Entertainment]] bought out the rights to ''Thomas''. Rights to the ''Thomas'' DVDs now belong to Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (through their deal with [[Mattel]], HIT's current parent company). The company also has a top market share for fitness videos such as the ''[[Crunch (exercise)|Crunch]]'' and ''[[For Dummies]]'' series. The company also distributes [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] events on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n===Production company===\nAs a full-fledged production company, they handle television syndication of ''Halloween'', ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers|Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (which they also hold the video rights to), and have recently entered in-house production and distribution of theatrical films.\n\n==Award==\nAnchor Bay Entertainment received a Special Achievement Award from the [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] in June 2002. Anchor Bay was recognized as one of the \"pioneers in DVD releases and home video entertainment\" and \"successful in releasing dramas, comedies, foreign films, children's programming, and most prominently [[B movie|genre film]]s.\" Cited as highlights of Anchor Bay's releases were \"the films of [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Studios]], the works of [[Werner Herzog]], [[Paul Verhoeven]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[John Woo]], [[Monte Hellman]] and [[Sam Raimi]]\".<ref name=award>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_of_Science_Fiction_Fantasy_And_Horror_Films_USA/2002#Special_Award|title=2002 Special Award|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Past names==\n*Video Treasures\n*Starmaker Entertainment\n*MNTEX Entertainment\n*Teal Entertainment\n*Burbank Video\n*Drive Entertainment\n*GTS Records\n*Starz Home Entertainment\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films released by Anchor Bay Entertainment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.anchorbayent.com Official U.S. website]\n* [http://www.anchorbay.co.uk Official U.K. website]\n* [http://anchorbayent.com.au Official Australian website]\n* {{IMDb company|0209315|Anchor Bay Entertainment (Australia)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0113373|Anchor Bay Entertainment (U.K.)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0067793|Anchor Bay Entertainment (U.S.)}}\n* {{IMDb company|0249289|Anchor Bay Films}}\n* {{IMDb company|0053518|Video Treasures}}\n* {{IMDb company|0084780|Starmaker Entertainment}}\n* {{IMDb company|0015547|Starmaker Video}}\n* {{IMDb company|0015547|The Starmaker Group}}\n\n{{Lionsgate}}\n\n[[Category:Home video companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:Former Liberty Media subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Troy, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1985]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 2017]]\n[[Category:1985 establishments in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Starz Entertainment Group]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:The Weinstein Company]]\n[[Category:2017 disestablishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "68.40.101.206", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_Bay_Entertainment"}

Feucht reviewed ''American Militias: Rebellion, Racism & Religion'' by [[Richard Abanes]], and described the theory of Richard McDonald, a sovereign-citizen leader, which is that there are two classes of citizens in America: the \"original citizens of the states\" (or \"States citizens\") and \"U.S. citizens\". McDonald asserts that U.S. citizens or \"[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]\" \n<blockquote>citizens have civil rights, legislated to give the freed black slaves after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their ''[[de jure]]'' common-law state citizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a [[Social Security number]], driver's license, car registration, use of [[ZIP code]]s, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen landowner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or [[Allodial title|allodial property rights]]. Such allodial ownership is held \"without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof\" (''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.<ref name=\"Feucht\">{{cite web |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1997/PSCF6-97Feucht.html |title=Essay Review of AMERICAN MILITIAS: Rebellion, Racism & Religion |publisher=[[American Scientific Affiliation]] |work=[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] |date=June 1997 |accessdate=September 4, 2014 |author=Feucht, Dennis |pages=116\u2013118 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174413/http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1997/PSCF6-97Feucht.html |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn support of his theories, McDonald has established State Citizen Service Centers around the United States as well as a related web presence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state-citizen.org/ |title=Welcome to the State Citizen's Service Center |date=April 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326194746/http://www.state-citizen.org/ |archive-date=2014-03-26 |url-status = dead|access-date=2015-04-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWriter Richard Abanes asserts that sovereign citizens fail to sufficiently examine the context of the case laws they cite, and ignore adverse evidence, such as [[Federalist No. 15]], where [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed the view that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] placed everyone personally under federal authority.<ref name=Feucht />\n\nSome sovereign citizens also claim that they can become immune to most or all laws of the United States by renouncing their citizenship, a process they refer to as \"expatriation\", which involves filing or delivering a nonlegal document claiming to renounce citizenship in a \"federal corporation\" and declaring only to be a citizen of the state in which they reside, to any county clerk's office that can be convinced to accept it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sovereign citizens renounce first sentence of 14th Amendment|author=Morton, Tom|date=April 17, 2011|url=http://trib.com/news/local/casper/sovereign-citizens-renounce-first-sentence-of-th-amendment/article_a5d0f966-7ed0-549f-a066-b1b2c91f9489.html|newspaper=The Star Tribune|access-date=January 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121140213/http://trib.com/news/local/casper/sovereign-citizens-renounce-first-sentence-of-th-amendment/article_a5d0f966-7ed0-549f-a066-b1b2c91f9489.html|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a sovereign citizen originated in 1971 in the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus movement]] as a teaching of [[Christian Identity]] minister William P.

The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant's peculiar habits. First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names have some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that \"the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America ... are terminated [[nunc pro tunc]] by public policy, U.C.C. 1-103&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing \"United States\", he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it's the same country.\n\nSecond, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. \"COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, [date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, \"State of Body\" competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1.)\n\nThird, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law. Thus, Defendant argues that as a result of the \"REGISTERED FACTS\", the \"states of body, persons, actors and other parties perpetuating the above-captioned transaction(s) [i.e., the Court and prosecutors] are engaged ... in acts of TREASON, and if unknowingly as victims of TREASON and FRAUD&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud.

Anyone can file a notice of lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing. Notices of liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's [[credit rating]], ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices of releases of liens generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity of a lien is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent notices of liens may be expensive and time-consuming. Filing fraudulent notices of liens or documents is both a crime and a civil offense.<ref name=NYT82313>{{cite news|title=In Paper War, Flood of Liens Is the Weapon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/us/citizens-without-a-country-wage-battle-with-liens.html|accessdate=August 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 23, 2013|author=Erica Goode|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824215409/http://www.nytimes.com//2013//08//24//us//citizens-without-a-country-wage-battle-with-liens.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== U.S. government responses ==\nFollowing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Congress passed the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], enhancing sentences for certain terrorist-related offenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-john-p-carlin-delivers-remarks-domestic-terrorism-event-co|title=Assistant Attorney General John P.

Feucht reviewed ''American Militias: Rebellion, Racism & Religion'' by [[Richard Abanes]], and described the theory of Richard McDonald, a sovereign-citizen leader, which is that there are two classes of citizens in America: the \"original citizens of the states\" (or \"States citizens\") and \"U.S. citizens\". McDonald asserts that U.S. citizens or \"[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]\" \n<blockquote>citizens have civil rights, legislated to give the freed black slaves after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their ''[[de jure]]'' common-law state citizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a [[Social Security number]], driver's license, car registration, use of [[ZIP code]]s, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue.

The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant's peculiar habits. First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names have some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that \"the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America ... are terminated [[nunc pro tunc]] by public policy, U.C.C. 1-103&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing \"United States\", he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it's the same country.\n\nSecond, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. \"COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, [date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, \"State of Body\" competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1.)\n\nThird, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law. Thus, Defendant argues that as a result of the \"REGISTERED FACTS\", the \"states of body, persons, actors and other parties perpetuating the above-captioned transaction(s) [i.e., the Court and prosecutors] are engaged ... in acts of TREASON, and if unknowingly as victims of TREASON and FRAUD&nbsp;...\" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud.

Anyone can file a notice of lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing. Notices of liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's [[credit rating]], ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices of releases of liens generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity of a lien is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent notices of liens may be expensive and time-consuming.
