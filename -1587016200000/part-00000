She co-presents the [[Channel 4]] daytime puzzle show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' and its comedy spin-off ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]''. A mathematics graduate, her television debut came when she joined ''Countdown'' aged 22. With an interest in popularising mathematics and the sciences, she has since co-presented ''[[The Gadget Show]]'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] (2013\u201314) and ''[[It's Not Rocket Science]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (2016).

Like Vorderman, Riley's role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers rounds if the contestants are unable to do so.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7675710.stm|title=Sky host Stelling joins Countdown|date=21 November 2008|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 November 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218121151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7675710.stm|archivedate=18 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nRiley's appointment to ''Countdown'' was announced at the same time as the announcement of a new main host, [[Jeff Stelling]], replacing [[Des O'Connor]]; the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January 2009.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although she had no ambition to be a television presenter, she was encouraged to apply by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten 1,000 applicants for the role, she commented, \"There's only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I'm absolutely thrilled\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRiley takes the role of solving the numbers round so seriously that if she cannot solve it on the show, she takes it away with her to finish, commenting \"I'm really [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|OCD]] about it. I have to get it. I like puzzles \u2013 that's what I do, that's why I applied for the job, that's why I used to watch Countdown when I was younger. I like solving stuff.\" She has attributed this compulsion to a nervy and flustered start in the role which resulted in her making some errors, although she says she has since got the hang of it and the task is now a matter of routine. In contrast, on account of her \"really immature sense of humour\" she has some difficulty in maintaining her composure during the words round whenever rude words appear.\n\nRiley frequently encounters close media and public scrutiny of what she wears on the show, with her wardrobe choices attracting intense social media comment on [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]] and even national headlines. Working with a wardrobe consultant, she obtains most of the clothes from [[High Street]] stores, although some are purchased from a small boutique near her home in Southend. While trying to please everybody with varied choices, she nonetheless takes a phlegmatic approach to the attention, commenting, \"even with the same outfit you'll get polar-opposite views, so you can't win. You\u2019ve just got to learn that you can't please everyone all of the time\". The number of episodes means wearing some outfits more than once is inevitable\u2014she donates items she no longer requires to charity, some being auctioned by her mother.\n\nOn 11 January 2019, Riley celebrated ten years of being on ''Countdown''. To mark the occasion she showcased some of the ruder words that she has come across during her time on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/rachel-riley-shares-countdowns-rudest-13842289|title=Rachel Riley shares Countdown's rudest words from the last 10 years|last=Forsey|first=Zoe|date=11 January 2019|website=mirror|access-date=12 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111182523/https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/rachel-riley-shares-countdowns-rudest-13842289|archive-date=11 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/12/rachel-riley-marks-10-years-countdown-rude-words-8337907/|title=Rachel Riley marks 10 years of Countdown with all the rude words|last=Deen|first=Sarah|date=12 January 2019|website=metro.co.uk|access-date=13 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113182300/https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/12/rachel-riley-marks-10-years-countdown-rude-words-8337907/|archive-date=13 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== ''8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown'' ===\nSince it was first broadcast on 2 January 2012, Riley has also performed her ''Countdown'' role on the comedy crossover spin-off version, ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'', alongside comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] as host. While ''Countdown'' is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the difference between the two, Riley sees ''Countdown'' as the role she is happy for her grandmother to see, while ''Cats Does Countdown'' is the more risqu\u00e9, cheeky role which she shows to her friends. Some of the running gags used on the show are made by Carr at Riley's expense, aimed at her lack of dancing ability and a supposed frosty relationship with Vorderman, while in return Riley is often given jokes which mock Carr's supposed desires on herself and his [[tax avoidance]]. Due to scheduling conflicts with filming for ''It's Not Rocket Science'', Riley was replaced by [[Claudia Winkleman]] for two episodes in series nine (broadcast 3 and 10 March 2016).\n\n===''Strictly Come Dancing''===\nFrom September 2013, Riley appeared in the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 11)|eleventh series]] of the [[BBC One]] ballroom dancing programme ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' with professional dancing partner [[Pasha Kovalev]].

Explaining the purpose of the show as popularising science and making it seem less intimidating, she said \"It's showing that you can't separate the world of science from the world we live in\". She added that while her background is in mathematics, \"You can't separate them either. Maths is the language of science.\" A key part of the show was a weekly challenge where one of the presenters \"risked their lives\" to prove a scientific theory \u2013 in Riley's case she cycled on a tightrope and zip-lined through a ring of fire.\n\n===Sky Sports===\nIn August 2016, it was announced that Riley would join [[Sky Sports]] to present ''Friday Night Football'' alongside her former ''Countdown'' co-presenter [[Jeff Stelling]] and ''Fantasy Football Club'' with [[Max Rushden]] and [[Paul Merson]].<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a803870/countdown-rachel-riley-joins-sky-sports/ Unbelievable Jeff!

Working with a wardrobe consultant, she obtains most of the clothes from [[High Street]] stores, although some are purchased from a small boutique near her home in Southend. While trying to please everybody with varied choices, she nonetheless takes a phlegmatic approach to the attention, commenting, \"even with the same outfit you'll get polar-opposite views, so you can't win.

While ''Countdown'' is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the difference between the two, Riley sees ''Countdown'' as the role she is happy for her grandmother to see, while ''Cats Does Countdown'' is the more risqu\u00e9, cheeky role which she shows to her friends. Some of the running gags used on the show are made by Carr at Riley's expense, aimed at her lack of dancing ability and a supposed frosty relationship with Vorderman, while in return Riley is often given jokes which mock Carr's supposed desires on herself and his [[tax avoidance]]. Due to scheduling conflicts with filming for ''It's Not Rocket Science'', Riley was replaced by [[Claudia Winkleman]] for two episodes in series nine (broadcast 3 and 10 March 2016).\n\n===''Strictly Come Dancing''===\nFrom September 2013, Riley appeared in the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 11)|eleventh series]] of the [[BBC One]] ballroom dancing programme ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' with professional dancing partner [[Pasha Kovalev]].

She added that while her background is in mathematics, \"You can't separate them either.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] issues the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] issues the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions and would be used as a postal sorting centre up until the 1990s. \n\n====Postal Building Sculptures==== \nThe structures most notable feature (which has been retained) are the exterior 13-part series of limestone [[bas relief]] carvings by [[Louis Temporale]] Sr. [[Order of Canada|CM]] which depicts the history of transportation and communication in Canada. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger cuts made to the Crown Corporation), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s  on Eastern Avenue. Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions and would be used as a postal sorting centre up until the 1990s. \n\n====Postal Building Sculptures==== \nThe structures most notable feature (which has been retained) are the exterior 13-part series of limestone [[bas relief]] carvings by [[Louis Temporale]] Sr. [[Order of Canada|CM]] which depicts the history of transportation and communication in Canada. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger cuts made to the Crown Corporation), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s  on Eastern Avenue. Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey.

It is located in [[Division 1, Newfoundland and Labrador]] census division.  It is north east of [[Bay Roberts, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay Roberts]]. The Way office was established in 1864. The population was 942 in 1940; 1,346 in 1951, 1,563 in 1956, and 1762 in 1966. {{As of|2001}}, the [[population]] is 1,774.\n\n== Unique Town ==\nUpper Island Cove is a unique town both in its physical location and its culture. The town was once known as \u201cThe Walled City\u201d because it is built at the bottom of high cliffs. According to the Berry Census of 1675, the population was fourteen. The current population is 1774 (2001 census). A number of today's residents are descendants of these early fishermen from England and Ireland.<ref>Town of Upper Island Cove Website - http://upperislandcove.ca</ref>\n\n[[File:Upper Island Cove.jpg|thumb|Overlooking Conception Bay]]\n\nThe town is located about 110&nbsp;km from the capital city of St. John's off Route 70, the Conception Bay Highway, between the towns of Harbour Grace and Spaniard's Bay. There are Four entrances / exits to the town from Route 70: one through \u201cthe Thicket Road\u201d between Harbour Grace and Tilton and two entrances from Spaniard\u2019s Bay: one through the scenic Bishop\u2019s Cove Shoreline and the other through Crane\u2019s Road. There is also one through Bryants Cove, heading into South Side Road which leads to Riverhead.\n\nUpper Island Cove, like many communities on the Avalon is built on very rugged terrain. People had to remove rocks in order to farm the land. The rocks were then used to build rock walls that served as boundaries between properties. The rock walls can still be seen today.\n\nSince the early days of settlement, music, songs and stories have been handed down from generation to generation. Stories of Fairies or Little People who play evil tricks on inhabitants and stories of ghosts are still told. Music and song is a very big part of Upper Island Cove and the community is well known for its many musicians, singers and story tellers. Greeley's Reel and Mid Life Crisis are two well known musical groups with ties to the town.\n\n== St. Peter's Church and School ==\nThe Parish of Upper Island Cove is made up of three congregations. St. Peter's, Upper Island Cove; St. John the Evangelist, Bishop's Cove; and St. Andrew's, Bryant's Cove. The Parish dates to 1815 when construction began on the first church building at Upper Island Cove.\n\nToday, Upper Island Cove is one of the largest Anglican Parishes in the Diocese serving over 850 families in the three communities. Each of the Church buildings is unique in architecture and is well maintained. The Parish is served by active Sunday Schools, a Vacation Bible School, J.A., C.L.B., Three A.C.W. Branches, an A.C.A.A., and various Adult Christian Education Programs.\n\n[[File:St. Peter's Anglican Church, Upper Island Cove.jpg|thumb|St. Peter's Anglican Church]]\n\nSt. Peter\u2019s School celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2011.  It is a part of the Eastern School District, whose main offices are in St. John's. St. Peter's currently has an enrollment of 248 students and offers grades Kindergarten through Grade 9.

It is located in [[Division 1, Newfoundland and Labrador]] census division.  It is north east of [[Bay Roberts, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay Roberts]]. The Way office was established in 1864. The population was 942 in 1940; 1,346 in 1951, 1,563 in 1956, and 1762 in 1966. {{As of|2001}}, the [[population]] is 1,774.\n\n== Unique Town ==\nUpper Island Cove is a unique town both in its physical location and its culture. The town was once known as \u201cThe Walled City\u201d because it is built at the bottom of high cliffs. According to the Berry Census of 1675, the population was fourteen. The current population is 1774 (2001 census). A number of today's residents are descendants of these early fishermen from England and Ireland.<ref>Town of Upper Island Cove Website - http://upperislandcove.ca</ref>\n\n[[File:Upper Island Cove.jpg|thumb|Overlooking Conception Bay]]\n\nThe town is located about 110&nbsp;km from the capital city of St. John's off Route 70, the Conception Bay Highway, between the towns of Harbour Grace and Spaniard's Bay. There are Four entrances / exits to the town from Route 70: one through \u201cthe Thicket Road\u201d between Harbour Grace and Tilton and two entrances from Spaniard\u2019s Bay: one through the scenic Bishop\u2019s Cove Shoreline and the other through Crane\u2019s Road. There is also one through Bryants Cove, heading into South Side Road which leads to Riverhead.\n\nUpper Island Cove, like many communities on the Avalon is built on very rugged terrain. People had to remove rocks in order to farm the land. The rocks were then used to build rock walls that served as boundaries between properties. The rock walls can still be seen today.\n\nSince the early days of settlement, music, songs and stories have been handed down from generation to generation. Stories of Fairies or Little People who play evil tricks on inhabitants and stories of ghosts are still told. Music and song is a very big part of Upper Island Cove and the community is well known for its many musicians, singers and story tellers. Greeley's Reel and Mid Life Crisis are two well known musical groups with ties to the town.\n\n== St. Peter's Church and School ==\nThe Parish of Upper Island Cove is made up of three congregations. St. Peter's, Upper Island Cove; St. John the Evangelist, Bishop's Cove; and St. Andrew's, Bryant's Cove. The Parish dates to 1815 when construction began on the first church building at Upper Island Cove.\n\nToday, Upper Island Cove is one of the largest Anglican Parishes in the Diocese serving over 850 families in the three communities. Each of the Church buildings is unique in architecture and is well maintained. The Parish is served by active Sunday Schools, a Vacation Bible School, J.A., C.L.B., Three A.C.W. Branches, an A.C.A.A., and various Adult Christian Education Programs.\n\n[[File:St. Peter's Anglican Church, Upper Island Cove.jpg|thumb|St. Peter's Anglican Church]]\n\nSt. Peter\u2019s School celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2011.

His inspiration was [[Harold Eugene Edgerton]]. He experimented capturing water splash and speeding air-gun pellets in his room with [[Do it yourself|DIY]] sound triggers and [[Motion detector|motion detectors]].

To fund his film rolls and equipment during college, he worked as a part-time freelance photographer shooting fashion shows and events.\n\n== Early Career ==\nArjun used to apprentice photographers part-time during college. After completing his degree in B.Sc [[Visual communication|Visual Communication]] at [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola college]] in 2004, he was a full-time apprentice with a photographer in Chennai. He had worked with him for two years before branching out independently in 2007. Later, Arjun worked independently on assignments in Chennai for almost two years. He was at the same time, looking out to move to a larger market in a larger city.\n\nHe received an opportunity to apprentice under a reputed fashion photographer based in [[Mumbai]].
