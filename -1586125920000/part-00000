Christopher Bell, an associate professor of media studies at the [[University of Colorado]] has called Kidz Bop \"an abomination\" because it censors language but not content, altering specific words without changing or obscuring the underlying tone or meaning. He explained: \"I don't need a sanitized version of \"[[Despacito]]\" \u2014 I need 8-year-olds not to be singing \"Despacito\" because that [song] is super dirty.

Christopher Bell, an associate professor of media studies at the [[University of Colorado]] has called Kidz Bop \"an abomination\" because it censors language but not content, altering specific words without changing or obscuring the underlying tone or meaning. He explained: \"I don't need a sanitized version of \"[[Despacito]]\" \u2014 I need 8-year-olds not to be singing \"Despacito\" because that [song] is super dirty.

OUCHIE! Why would you put your finger right inside of my stinky, hairy, dirty, musky nyash?! oh well, it feels nice kinda hehe ;)\n\n==Gameplay==\nUpon activating the toy, an egg appears on the screen. After setting the clock on the device, the egg will wiggle for several minutes, and then hatch into a small [[pet]]. In later versions, inputting the player's name and birthday is also required when setting the clock, and at birth, the player can name the pet and learn of its family group and/or gender. The player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions.  The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models a pause function was included.\n\nPets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet meter, and Discipline meter to determine how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of [[bread]] or [[hamburger]]) or a snack (usually a piece of [[candy]] or [[cake]]). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the \"scold\" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave [[feces|droppings]] around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.\n\nIf the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons, such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the \"Medicine\" option, however it may need to be pressed more than once. Usually, a pet will not play or accept a meal when sick.\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of time, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes.  The pet can \"die\" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pet's life cycle stages are '''Baby''', '''Child''', '''Teenager''', and '''Adult'''. Later Tamagotchi models have added a '''Senior''' model.  Usually the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.\n\nPoor care can cause a pet to die, but it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to indicate its return to its home planet. Pressing the right button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, a player can restart the game.\n\n===New mechanics===\nIn recent models, the player earns currency called Gotchi Points while playing games, and can use the currency in an in-game shop to buy different foods, toys, accessories, or even room decorations for the pet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Connectivity====\nUsing infrared communication, two players can link their toys and the pets may form friendships, play games, exchange gifts, and even marry. Infrared connection was introduced with the Plus/Connection, but the Japanese Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi was the first model to interact with a computer. Since then, many subsequent models have also been able to interact with the E-Tamago or Tamatown websites by using alphanumeric codes generated by the toy to log into the website's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game.  After generating a code, the toy remains paused until the player either enters a logout code or cancels.  The player may play minigames in the town to earn Gotchi Points, or use Gotchi Points to buy items in the town shops.  To transfer points and items back to the toy, the player signs out of the Flash game and is given a code to input back into the toy. Newer models, such as the Tamagotchi 4U and the Tamagotchi 4U+ can connect to other Tamagotchi 4U units, as well as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], using [[near-field communication]]. Unlike previous models, the Tamagotchi 4U does not have infrared, which consequently caused it to sell rather poorly.\n\n====Marriage and family====\nThe Mesutchi and Osutchi Tamagotchis were the first to introduce marriages and offspring, and the feature returned in the Plus/Connection and subsequent models.  Two players with a male and female pet may link their toys and allow the pets to develop a friendship and fall in love.  Once the pets have raised their relationship meter sufficiently, the pets may marry. The player can also choose to have their pet marry a random pet brought in by the \"Matchmaker.\"  Once married, the female will eventually produce two eggs, keeping one and leaving one with the male. Since the parent will automatically guide the baby's life, the only care it needs from the player is medicine in the case of sickness. After a few days the parent will leave, and the player is left to care for a new generation. This can continue for as long as the player manages to care for the pets.<br />\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced the idea of character \"families\" or \"groups.\"  These \"families\" are a kind of [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] for characters obtainable in the game, grouped mainly by appearance, though they are also associated with certain skills. A character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be of the female's group. ''Tamagotchi M!X'', the latest Japanese release, has a notable change to this feature; in this release, Tamagotchi offspring have merged traits from both of their parents.\n\n====Other====\nWith the many different versions of the toy, there are other less common mechanics that influence the pet's growth, including but not limited to friendship with the player, varying types of skills, and career.\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced Skills, which can be built by playing certain games with the pet, or using certain toys or foods bought from the E-Tamago or in-game shops.

Along with the original Tamagotchi, the first wave of Tamagotchi toys included Christmas, angel, and ocean themed versions. The newer versions began in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Plus, and the most recent version is the Japanese ''Tamagotchi Meets'', which was released overseas in 2019 as ''Tamagotchi On''.\n\nIn early 2013, Bandai released an enhanced version of the original 1996 Tamagotchi as a free [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app named \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.\". A sequel to the game, \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e. Angel\", was released on February 26, 2014.\nAs of July 2019, Tamagotchis are now available in color in the United States which they are called \"Tamagotchi ON\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tamagotchi Have Returned to Bewitch a New Generation|date=May 13, 2019|first1=Arielle|last1=Pardes|url=https://www.wired.com/story/tamagotchi-on-price-release-date/|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\nSince its debut, Tamagotchi has made its way onto several gaming platforms.

Introduced are Tanpopo, a human girl who Mametchi accidentally transports to the Tamagotchi Planet; and Chamametchi, the younger sister of Mametchi who is born during the film's events. ''Tamagotchi: The Movie'' was released on December 15, 2007, and was distributed by [[Toho|Toho Co.]] The film opened at number 3 at the box office on opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-17/japanese-box-office-december-15-16-tamagotchi-at-no.3 |title=Japanese Box Office, December 15\u201316: Tamagotchi at #3 |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> On May 31, 2008, [[North America]]n distributor [[Bandai Visual|Bandai Entertainment]] announced they had acquired the rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-30/bandai-entertaiment-gets-tamagotchi-feature-film |title=Bandai Entertainment Gets Tamagotchi Feature Film |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> The movie's first English release was a direct-to-DVD version, released on June 3, 2009 in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]].

This film, introducing a new Tamagotchi known as Hapihapitchi, was later released on DVD, on June 26, 2009. Unlike the first film, ''Happiest Story in the Universe'' has not been dubbed in English, but an extremely rare English dub existed in the Philippines. [[Madman Entertainment]] intended to dub ''Happiest Story in the Universe!'', but the dub was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Bandai announced a new Tamagotchi short film called ''Tamagotchi: Secret Delivery Operation''. The film was theatrically released alongside the ''[[Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama]]'' film on April 28, 2017, and was included in the ''Cocotama'' movie's DVD released on December 6th, 2017.

The characters are colorful creatures with simple designs based on animals, objects, or people. In 2004, beginning with the Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO<ref>{{cite web|title=Character |url=http://www.jinco100.com/|website=JINCO100%|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature.<ref name=\"rtfm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tamatalk.com/IB/topic/116745-original-instruction-manuals/ |title=Original Instruction Manuals}}</ref>  The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention. Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as [[List of Tamagotchi releases#TamagoChu|TamagoChu]], require little to no care from the player.\n\n[[Bandai]] released the Tamagotchi in Japan in November 1996, initially marketing them exclusively to teenage girls.<ref name=NGen34>{{cite magazine|title=Finding Companionship in a Digital Age |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=34|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=October 1997|pages=56-63}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nUpon activating the toy, an egg appears on the screen. After setting the clock on the device, the egg will wiggle for several minutes, and then hatch into a small [[pet]]. In later versions, inputting the player's name and birthday is also required when setting the clock, and at birth, the player can name the pet and learn of its family group and/or gender. The player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions.  The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models a pause function was included.\n\nPets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet meter, and Discipline meter to determine how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of [[bread]] or [[hamburger]]) or a snack (usually a piece of [[candy]] or [[cake]]). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the \"scold\" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave [[feces|droppings]] around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.\n\nIf the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons, such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the \"Medicine\" option, however it may need to be pressed more than once. Usually, a pet will not play or accept a meal when sick.\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of time, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes.  The pet can \"die\" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pet's life cycle stages are '''Baby''', '''Child''', '''Teenager''', and '''Adult'''. Later Tamagotchi models have added a '''Senior''' model.  Usually the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.\n\nPoor care can cause a pet to die, but it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to indicate its return to its home planet. Pressing the right button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, a player can restart the game.\n\n===New mechanics===\nIn recent models, the player earns currency called Gotchi Points while playing games, and can use the currency in an in-game shop to buy different foods, toys, accessories, or even room decorations for the pet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Connectivity====\nUsing infrared communication, two players can link their toys and the pets may form friendships, play games, exchange gifts, and even marry. Infrared connection was introduced with the Plus/Connection, but the Japanese Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi was the first model to interact with a computer. Since then, many subsequent models have also been able to interact with the E-Tamago or Tamatown websites by using alphanumeric codes generated by the toy to log into the website's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game.  After generating a code, the toy remains paused until the player either enters a logout code or cancels.  The player may play minigames in the town to earn Gotchi Points, or use Gotchi Points to buy items in the town shops.  To transfer points and items back to the toy, the player signs out of the Flash game and is given a code to input back into the toy. Newer models, such as the Tamagotchi 4U and the Tamagotchi 4U+ can connect to other Tamagotchi 4U units, as well as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], using [[near-field communication]]. Unlike previous models, the Tamagotchi 4U does not have infrared, which consequently caused it to sell rather poorly.\n\n====Marriage and family====\nThe Mesutchi and Osutchi Tamagotchis were the first to introduce marriages and offspring, and the feature returned in the Plus/Connection and subsequent models.  Two players with a male and female pet may link their toys and allow the pets to develop a friendship and fall in love.  Once the pets have raised their relationship meter sufficiently, the pets may marry. The player can also choose to have their pet marry a random pet brought in by the \"Matchmaker.\"  Once married, the female will eventually produce two eggs, keeping one and leaving one with the male. Since the parent will automatically guide the baby's life, the only care it needs from the player is medicine in the case of sickness. After a few days the parent will leave, and the player is left to care for a new generation. This can continue for as long as the player manages to care for the pets.<br />\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced the idea of character \"families\" or \"groups.\"  These \"families\" are a kind of [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] for characters obtainable in the game, grouped mainly by appearance, though they are also associated with certain skills. A character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be of the female's group. ''Tamagotchi M!X'', the latest Japanese release, has a notable change to this feature; in this release, Tamagotchi offspring have merged traits from both of their parents.\n\n====Other====\nWith the many different versions of the toy, there are other less common mechanics that influence the pet's growth, including but not limited to friendship with the player, varying types of skills, and career.\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced Skills, which can be built by playing certain games with the pet, or using certain toys or foods bought from the E-Tamago or in-game shops.  Having certain skills can help the pet obtain a career, and if built up high enough, can unlock special characters.\n\n==Releases==\n{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | text=When we were stuck on talk of the spectacular 3D graphics of ''[[Super Mario 64|Mario 64]]'' and racing games, we saw a huge hit in the form of Tamagotchi \u2014 a tiny key chain boasting pictures made up of no more than 10 or 20 dots.

Along with the original Tamagotchi, the first wave of Tamagotchi toys included Christmas, angel, and ocean themed versions. The newer versions began in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Plus, and the most recent version is the Japanese ''Tamagotchi Meets'', which was released overseas in 2019 as ''Tamagotchi On''.\n\nIn early 2013, Bandai released an enhanced version of the original 1996 Tamagotchi as a free [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app named \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.\". A sequel to the game, \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.

This film, introducing a new Tamagotchi known as Hapihapitchi, was later released on DVD, on June 26, 2009. Unlike the first film, ''Happiest Story in the Universe'' has not been dubbed in English, but an extremely rare English dub existed in the Philippines. [[Madman Entertainment]] intended to dub ''Happiest Story in the Universe!'', but the dub was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Bandai announced a new Tamagotchi short film called ''Tamagotchi: Secret Delivery Operation''. The film was theatrically released alongside the ''[[Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama]]'' film on April 28, 2017, and was included in the ''Cocotama'' movie's DVD released on December 6th, 2017.

In some instances, such as in the case of forging an understanding of ''Yellow Power'', scholars have noted that the need to create a pan-Asian identity and dismantle existing stereotypes (e.g. \"[[model minority]]\") are also necessary steps which precede the formation of cross-racial unity, as Asian-American activists, writers, and scholars such as [[Amy Uyematsu]], [[Franklin Odo]], Larry Kubota, Keith Osajima, and [[Daniel Okimoto]] have addressed since the late 1960s.<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 35-42.</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe racial-political ideology of Black-Brown(-Yellow-Red) unity is inherently based in recognizing the similarities regarding historical and contemporary oppression endured by people of color globally. Scholars examining this racial-political ideology examine histories to demonstrate how the social and economic oppression of various groups of people of color are not isolated from one another, but rather share many similarities. As a result, the range of potential scholarship regarding Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity may be broad, yet ultimately works toward a common goal of emphasizing the need for unity.<ref>Eisenstein 2004, p. 55.</ref> \n\n[[Zillah R. Eisenstein|Zillah Eisenstein]] and other scholars recognize how the need for unity among people of color emerged from the global nature of oppression and its relationship with capitalism, colonialism, masculinity, and white supremacy. As a result of this force, unity among people of color therefore operates as a means of resistance against this structure.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>The language of otherness and difference became naturalized as the empire's continents become dark, and races become savage. There is a colonialist history to this becoming. Capitalism is the story of colonial conquest, of the Americas, then of Asia and Africa. And this conquest is part and parcel of an imperial masculinity which fantasizes the protection of white femininity. Dominance and domination are white and male. Colonialism simply presents itself as civilization and attempts to naturalize theft, rape, and dehumanization.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>Similarly, [[Gary Okihiro]] recognizes how European colonialism was built on an ideology which justified \"their expansion and appropriation of land, labor, and resources in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\" This ideology of white superiority was justified \"in the name of religion and science\" which was wielded by the Europeans to assert their own purported superiority and \"civilized\" status in comparison to the \"anti-Christian, uncivilized non-Europeans.\" According to Okihiro, when enacted through colonialism, this ideology led to a plundering of the world by Europeans and the global [[Slave Trade|slave trade]], which dehumanized enslaved peoples as units of production \u2013 a system of European development constructed on the underdevelopment of the [[Third World]].<ref name=\":6\">Okihiro 1994, p. 37-38.</ref>\n== History ==\n{{Black Power sidebar}}The first wave of movements asserting the objective of forming unity or coalitions between people of color and economically disadvantaged whites, began in the late 1960s in the United States and declined by the 1970s. Chicano activists such as [[Cesar Chavez]] in 1965-1966 and [[Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina]] in 1967-1969 collaborated with civil rights and Black Power organizations to forge Black-Brown collaborative activist work. Organizations such as the [[Poor People's Campaign]], organized by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968 and Fred Hampton's [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|Rainbow Coalition]] in 1969 attempted to construct multiracial coalitions based on the common interest of dismantling the structures which created poverty.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 5-6.</ref> However, as a result of police brutality, government surveillance and harassment, sabotage campaigns by government agencies and local police departments which targeted activist organizations with the intention of producing distrust and disunity among activists and organizations, and the assassination of leaders such as King and Hampton, this wave of multiracial coalition building declined by the 1970s.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 9-10.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Brown unity ===\n{{Chicano and Mexican-American series}}\nAn unprecedented meeting of African American and Mexican American activists occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the [[Alianza Federal de Pueblos Libres]] 1967 conference hosted by Reies Tijerina to explore Black and Brown unity, cooperation, and forge a cross-racial alliance. Representatives from nearly every major [[Black Power]] organization were present, including Anthony Akku Babu of the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Ron Karenga]] of the [[US Organization|Us organization]], James Dennis of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], Ralph Featherstone of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and Walter Bremond of the Black Congress. Representatives of Chicano groups were also present, including [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Guti\u00e9rrez|Jos\u00e9 Angel Guti\u00e9rrez]] of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]], [[Bert Corona]] of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], D\u00e1vid Sanchez of the [[Brown Berets]], and [[Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonzales]] of the Crusade for Justice.<ref name=\":0\">Behnken 2012, p. 1-3.</ref> Activist [[Maria Varela]] was also invited to the conference and to join the Alianza by Tijerina.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nThe meeting ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Peace, Harmony, and Mutual Assistance]], a seven-part pact which acknowledged mutual respect and cooperative alliance. Along with the other representatives, Hopi spiritual leader [[Thomas Banyacya]], who was present at the conference along with many northern New Mexican villagers, also signed the treaty, which began with the following five articles:<ref name=\":9\">Mantler 2013, p. 74-75.</ref><blockquote>Article I: \"Both peoples do promise not to permit the members of either of said peoples to  make false propaganda of any kind whatsoever against each other, either by SPEECH or WRITING.\"\n\nArticle II: \"Both peoples (races) do promise, never to permit violence or hate, to break this SOLEMN TREATY between said peoples.\"\n\nArticle III: Both peoples, make a SOLEMN promise, to cure and remedy the historical errors and differences that exist between said peoples.\n\nArticle IV: Let it be known, that there will be a RECIPROCAL right to send an EMISSARY or DELEGATE to the conventions, Congresses, and National reunions of each of said peoples.\n\nArticle V: Let it be known that both peoples will have a political delegate to represent his interests and relations with the other.</blockquote>The treaty concluded with the following statement: \"this TREATY, will be valid between the two said peoples, as long as the Sun and Moon shall shine.\" While this agreement recognized that disagreements and conflicts between Black and Brown people had been present in a society which actively oppressed both groups, it signified an attempt to forge a coalitive liberation movement, and has been noted by scholars in comparative civil rights scholarship to represent the inception of an attempt to forge Black-Brown unity.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAttempts at coalition work between Black and Brown people largely occurred in the [[southwestern United States]] and had notable regional differences. In [[California]], Black and Brown unity was exemplified through groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the [[National Farm Workers Association]] to combat racial segregation and fight for economic rights for farm workers. In [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], many Black Americans united with Mexican American groups in order to strengthen their civil rights struggle. In [[Texas]], both Black and Brown Americans had their own widespread civil rights movements and unification was often not accentuated. Scholar Brian D. Behnken noted that \"when African American and Mexican American activists moderated the divisive power of race by focusing on economics, they recognized the shared oppression of each group\" and collectively fought for improved wages, hours, and working conditions.<ref>Behnken 2012, p. 8-9.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the [[Black Power]] movement, some Chicanos accentuated the similarities between Black and Brown political struggles. In 1968, the [[La Raza (newspaper)|''La Raza'']] newspaper claimed the following on the relationship and shared struggle of Black Americans and Chicano communities: \"Our oppressions are one.

These schools were often overcrowded and poorly funded whereas white schools were newly built and not filled to capacity. The [[Chicano Blowouts]] of 1968, in which tens of thousands of students protested unequal conditions in Los Angeles schools, were accompanied by walkouts of thousands of Black students in South Los Angeles, who also participated.

Okihiro documents the \"[[coolie]]\" slave trade, in which approximately one-third of Asian enslaved peoples perished en route to the Americas under the forced authority of European and American ship captains, to assert that \"the African and Asian coolie were kinsmen and kinswomen in that world created by European masters. For example, over 124,000 Chinese \"coolies\" were shipped to [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] to service Cuba's plantation system. Historian [[Franklin W. Knight]] writes that the Chinese became \"coinheritors with the Negroes of the lowliness of caste, the abuse, the ruthless exploitation.... Chinese labor in Cuba in the nineteenth century was slavery in every social aspect except the name.\" African and Asian forced laborers \"were related insofar as they were both essential for the maintenance of white supremacy, they were both members of an oppressed class of 'colored laborers, and they both were tied historically to the global network of labor migration as slaves and coolies.\"<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 42-45.</ref> African American community and political leaders, such as [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], recognized this shared oppression openly.<ref name=\":7\">Okihiro 1994, p. 48.</ref> \n\nRacism against African and Asian Americans was expressed via American law and proposed legislation. In [[California]] case ''The People v. George W. Hall'' (1854), Justice Charles J. Murray reversed the conviction of Hall, who had been convicted of murder based on the testimony of Chinese witnesses, based on legal precedents which had determined that \"no black or mulatto person, or Indian, shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of, or against a white man\" applied to Asian persons, since, in the American legal perception, \"''black'' meant ''nonwhite'' and ''white'' excluded all persons of color.\" The court upheld this decision on the grounds that white men should be shielded from the testimony \"of the degraded and demoralized caste\" of racially inferior peoples.<ref>Okihiro 1994, p. 50-51.</ref> In 1860, California legally banned African, Asian, and Amerindian children from attending schools designated for whites.

Philip Randolph|A. Phillip Randolph]]'s [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], the Pullman Company hired Filipinos, which the Brotherhood initially referred to as \"scab laborers.\" However, by the 1930s, unlike the [[American Federation of Labor]] which excluded both Africans and Asians, the Brotherhood recognized the common struggle between Asian and African workers:<ref name=\":8\" /><blockquote>We wish it understood, that the Brotherhood has nothing against Filipinos. They have been used against the unionization of Pullman porters just as Negroes have been used against the unionization of white workers... We will take in Filipinos as members...

They have become white in every respect but color.\"<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 39-40.</ref>\n\n=== \"Mexican Americans\" and whiteness ===\n{{See also|Chicano}}\nPrior to the establishment of the [[Chicano Movement]] and the consolidation of [[Chicano]] identity in the late 1960s and 1970s, most Mexican American community leaders were fixated on attempting to appeal to the white establishment by claiming a white identity. Lisa Y. Ramos notes that, prior to the 1960s, many \"Mexican American leaders were wedded to whiteness, meaning they possessed a strong identification with the white race and especially the idea of white racial supremacy over other racial groups.\"<ref name=\":1\">Ramos 2012, p. 19-20</ref> In the 1930s, legal scholar [[Ian Haney L\u00f3pez]] records that \"community leaders promoted the term ''Mexican American'' to convey an assimilationist ideology stressing white identity.\"<ref name=\":2\">L\u00f3pez 2009, p. 1-3.</ref> Ramos notes that \"this phenomenon demonstrates why no Black-Brown civil rights effort emerged prior to the 1960s.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nChicano identity was critical in shifting these perceptions among Mexican Americans towards opening the possibility of Black-Brown unity, as \"Chicanos defined themselves as proud members of a brown race, thereby rejecting not only the previous generation's assimilationist orientation but their racial pretensions as well.\" Even prior to the 1960s, members of the Mexican community who were of darker [[complexion]], recent immigrants, and/or working-class often identified based on their cultural or familial ties in Mexico and not by their race. In the 1940s and 1950s, as a precursor to the Chicano Movement, Mexican youth rejected the previous generation's racial aspirations and developed an \"alienated [[Pachuco]] culture that fashioned itself neither as Mexican nor American.\" As a result, some scholars designate a difference between Chicanos and Mexican Americans. According to L\u00f3pez, \"''Mexican Americans'' refers to the Mexican community who insisted that Mexicans are white, and ''Chicanos'' refers to those who argued instead that Mexicans constitute a non-white race.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}<br />\n==References==\n\n* [[Elizabeth Abel|Abel, Elizabeth]] (2010).

In some instances, such as in the case of forging an understanding of ''Yellow Power'', scholars have noted that the need to create a pan-Asian identity and dismantle existing stereotypes (e.g. \"[[model minority]]\") are also necessary steps which precede the formation of cross-racial unity, as Asian-American activists, writers, and scholars such as [[Amy Uyematsu]], [[Franklin Odo]], Larry Kubota, Keith Osajima, and [[Daniel Okimoto]] have addressed since the late 1960s.<ref>Watkins 2012, p. 35-42.</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe racial-political ideology of Black-Brown(-Yellow-Red) unity is inherently based in recognizing the similarities regarding historical and contemporary oppression endured by people of color globally. Scholars examining this racial-political ideology examine histories to demonstrate how the social and economic oppression of various groups of people of color are not isolated from one another, but rather share many similarities. As a result, the range of potential scholarship regarding Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity may be broad, yet ultimately works toward a common goal of emphasizing the need for unity.<ref>Eisenstein 2004, p. 55.</ref> \n\n[[Zillah R. Eisenstein|Zillah Eisenstein]] and other scholars recognize how the need for unity among people of color emerged from the global nature of oppression and its relationship with capitalism, colonialism, masculinity, and white supremacy. As a result of this force, unity among people of color therefore operates as a means of resistance against this structure.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>The language of otherness and difference became naturalized as the empire's continents become dark, and races become savage. There is a colonialist history to this becoming. Capitalism is the story of colonial conquest, of the Americas, then of Asia and Africa. And this conquest is part and parcel of an imperial masculinity which fantasizes the protection of white femininity. Dominance and domination are white and male. Colonialism simply presents itself as civilization and attempts to naturalize theft, rape, and dehumanization.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>Similarly, [[Gary Okihiro]] recognizes how European colonialism was built on an ideology which justified \"their expansion and appropriation of land, labor, and resources in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\" This ideology of white superiority was justified \"in the name of religion and science\" which was wielded by the Europeans to assert their own purported superiority and \"civilized\" status in comparison to the \"anti-Christian, uncivilized non-Europeans.\" According to Okihiro, when enacted through colonialism, this ideology led to a plundering of the world by Europeans and the global [[Slave Trade|slave trade]], which dehumanized enslaved peoples as units of production \u2013 a system of European development constructed on the underdevelopment of the [[Third World]].<ref name=\":6\">Okihiro 1994, p. 37-38.</ref>\n== History ==\n{{Black Power sidebar}}The first wave of movements asserting the objective of forming unity or coalitions between people of color and economically disadvantaged whites, began in the late 1960s in the United States and declined by the 1970s. Chicano activists such as [[Cesar Chavez]] in 1965-1966 and [[Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina]] in 1967-1969 collaborated with civil rights and Black Power organizations to forge Black-Brown collaborative activist work. Organizations such as the [[Poor People's Campaign]], organized by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968 and Fred Hampton's [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|Rainbow Coalition]] in 1969 attempted to construct multiracial coalitions based on the common interest of dismantling the structures which created poverty.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 5-6.</ref> However, as a result of police brutality, government surveillance and harassment, sabotage campaigns by government agencies and local police departments which targeted activist organizations with the intention of producing distrust and disunity among activists and organizations, and the assassination of leaders such as King and Hampton, this wave of multiracial coalition building declined by the 1970s.<ref>Mantler 2013, p. 9-10.</ref>\n\n=== Black-Brown unity ===\n{{Chicano and Mexican-American series}}\nAn unprecedented meeting of African American and Mexican American activists occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the [[Alianza Federal de Pueblos Libres]] 1967 conference hosted by Reies Tijerina to explore Black and Brown unity, cooperation, and forge a cross-racial alliance. Representatives from nearly every major [[Black Power]] organization were present, including Anthony Akku Babu of the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Ron Karenga]] of the [[US Organization|Us organization]], James Dennis of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], Ralph Featherstone of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and Walter Bremond of the Black Congress. Representatives of Chicano groups were also present, including [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Guti\u00e9rrez|Jos\u00e9 Angel Guti\u00e9rrez]] of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]], [[Bert Corona]] of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], D\u00e1vid Sanchez of the [[Brown Berets]], and [[Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonzales]] of the Crusade for Justice.<ref name=\":0\">Behnken 2012, p. 1-3.</ref> Activist [[Maria Varela]] was also invited to the conference and to join the Alianza by Tijerina.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nThe meeting ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Peace, Harmony, and Mutual Assistance]], a seven-part pact which acknowledged mutual respect and cooperative alliance. Along with the other representatives, Hopi spiritual leader [[Thomas Banyacya]], who was present at the conference along with many northern New Mexican villagers, also signed the treaty, which began with the following five articles:<ref name=\":9\">Mantler 2013, p. 74-75.</ref><blockquote>Article I: \"Both peoples do promise not to permit the members of either of said peoples to  make false propaganda of any kind whatsoever against each other, either by SPEECH or WRITING.\"\n\nArticle II: \"Both peoples (races) do promise, never to permit violence or hate, to break this SOLEMN TREATY between said peoples.\"\n\nArticle III: Both peoples, make a SOLEMN promise, to cure and remedy the historical errors and differences that exist between said peoples.\n\nArticle IV: Let it be known, that there will be a RECIPROCAL right to send an EMISSARY or DELEGATE to the conventions, Congresses, and National reunions of each of said peoples.\n\nArticle V: Let it be known that both peoples will have a political delegate to represent his interests and relations with the other.</blockquote>The treaty concluded with the following statement: \"this TREATY, will be valid between the two said peoples, as long as the Sun and Moon shall shine.\" While this agreement recognized that disagreements and conflicts between Black and Brown people had been present in a society which actively oppressed both groups, it signified an attempt to forge a coalitive liberation movement, and has been noted by scholars in comparative civil rights scholarship to represent the inception of an attempt to forge Black-Brown unity.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAttempts at coalition work between Black and Brown people largely occurred in the [[southwestern United States]] and had notable regional differences. In [[California]], Black and Brown unity was exemplified through groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the [[National Farm Workers Association]] to combat racial segregation and fight for economic rights for farm workers. In [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], many Black Americans united with Mexican American groups in order to strengthen their civil rights struggle. In [[Texas]], both Black and Brown Americans had their own widespread civil rights movements and unification was often not accentuated. Scholar Brian D. Behnken noted that \"when African American and Mexican American activists moderated the divisive power of race by focusing on economics, they recognized the shared oppression of each group\" and collectively fought for improved wages, hours, and working conditions.<ref>Behnken 2012, p. 8-9.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the [[Black Power]] movement, some Chicanos accentuated the similarities between Black and Brown political struggles. In 1968, the [[La Raza (newspaper)|''La Raza'']] newspaper claimed the following on the relationship and shared struggle of Black Americans and Chicano communities: \"Our oppressions are one. Our dreams are one. Our demands are one.

Ramos notes that, prior to the 1960s, many \"Mexican American leaders were wedded to whiteness, meaning they possessed a strong identification with the white race and especially the idea of white racial supremacy over other racial groups.\"<ref name=\":1\">Ramos 2012, p. 19-20</ref> In the 1930s, legal scholar [[Ian Haney L\u00f3pez]] records that \"community leaders promoted the term ''Mexican American'' to convey an assimilationist ideology stressing white identity.\"<ref name=\":2\">L\u00f3pez 2009, p. 1-3.</ref> Ramos notes that \"this phenomenon demonstrates why no Black-Brown civil rights effort emerged prior to the 1960s.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nChicano identity was critical in shifting these perceptions among Mexican Americans towards opening the possibility of Black-Brown unity, as \"Chicanos defined themselves as proud members of a brown race, thereby rejecting not only the previous generation's assimilationist orientation but their racial pretensions as well.\" Even prior to the 1960s, members of the Mexican community who were of darker [[complexion]], recent immigrants, and/or working-class often identified based on their cultural or familial ties in Mexico and not by their race. In the 1940s and 1950s, as a precursor to the Chicano Movement, Mexican youth rejected the previous generation's racial aspirations and developed an \"alienated [[Pachuco]] culture that fashioned itself neither as Mexican nor American.\" As a result, some scholars designate a difference between Chicanos and Mexican Americans. According to L\u00f3pez, \"''Mexican Americans'' refers to the Mexican community who insisted that Mexicans are white, and ''Chicanos'' refers to those who argued instead that Mexicans constitute a non-white race.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}<br />\n==References==\n\n* [[Elizabeth Abel|Abel, Elizabeth]] (2010).

After [[World War II]], Anthony decided that entering the electronics industry was a good idea, and bought a large stock of surplus wartime electronic parts with the intention of building kits with them. In 1947, Heath introduced its first [[electronic kit]], the O1 [[oscilloscope]] that sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]50\u2014the price was unbeatable at the time, and the oscilloscope went on to be a huge seller.<ref name=\"columbiaara.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaara.org/CNL/CN200011.pdf |last=Rostky |first=George |title=A Tale Of The Unstoppable Electronic Kit |work=[[EE Times]] |date=2 October 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210656/http://www.columbiaara.org/CNL/CN200011.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Heathkit product concept ==\n[[File:Io12u.jpg|thumb|upright|Heathkit IO12U oscilloscope built in 1967]]\nAfter the success of the oscilloscope kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchasers could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a significantly lower cash cost and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it themselves.  During those decades, the premise was basically valid. Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as [[vacuum tube]]s, tube sockets, capacitors, inductors and [[resistor]]s, and essentially hand-wired and assembled. The home kit-builder could perform these assembly tasks himself, and, if careful, to at least the same standard of quality. In the case of their most expensive product, the [[Thomas Organ Company|Thomas electronic organ]], building the Heathkit version represented substantial savings.\n\nOne category in which Heathkit enjoyed great popularity was [[amateur radio]]. [[Ham radio operator]]s had frequently been forced to [[Amateur radio homebrew|build their equipment from scratch]] before the advent of kits, with the difficulty of procuring all the parts separately and relying on often-experimental designs. Kits brought the convenience of all parts being supplied together and the assurance of a predictable finished product; many Heathkit models became well known in the ham radio community. The HW-101 HF transceiver became so ubiquitous that even today the \"Hot Water One-Oh-One\" can be found in use, or purchased as used equipment at [[hamfest]]s, decades after it went out of production.\n\n[[File:HeathkitAA141f-19710220.jpg|left|thumb|Heathkit AA141 stereo preamplifier, 1962.]]In the case of electronic test equipment, Heathkits often filled a low-end niche.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe instruction books were regarded as the best in the kit industry, being models of clarity, beginning with basic lessons on [[soldering]] technique, and proceeding with explicit directions, illustrated with line drawings: the drawings opened out so as to be opposite the relevant text (which might be several pages away) and were aligned with the assembler's eye position. Also in view was a box to check as each task was accomplished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/whatever-happened-to-heathkit-20689 |work=Electronic Design |date=February 18, 2009 |title=Whatever Happened To Heathkit? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229095811/http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/whatever-happened-to-heathkit-20689 |archivedate=December 29, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Heathkits as education==\n[[File:HeathkitAA141w-19710220.jpg|left|thumb|The wiring of a Heathkit AA141 stereo preamplifier, 1962.]]No knowledge of electronics was needed to assemble a Heathkit. The assembly process did not teach much about electronics, but provided a great deal of what could have been called \"electronics literacy\", such as the ability to identify tube pin numbers or read a [[Electronic color code|resistor color code]].  Many hobbyists began by assembling Heathkits, became familiar with the appearance of components like [[capacitor]]s, [[transformer]]s, resistors, and tubes, and were motivated to find out just what these components actually did. For those builders who had a deeper knowledge of electronics (or for those who wanted to be able to troubleshoot/repair the product in the future), the assembly manuals usually included a detailed \"Theory of Operation\" chapter, which explained the functioning of the kit's circuitry, section by section. Heath developed a relationship with electronics correspondence schools (e.g., [[National Radio Institute|NRI]]). Heath supplied electronic kits to be assembled as part of courses, with the school basing its texts and lessons around the kit.\n\nHeathkits could teach deeper lessons. \"The kits taught [[Steve Jobs]] that products were manifestations of human ingenuity, not magical objects dropped from the sky\", writes a business author, who goes on to quote Jobs as saying \"It gave a tremendous level of self-confidence, that through exploration and learning one could understand seemingly very complex things in one's environment.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Steve's Brain|author=Leander Kahney|publisher=Portfolio|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59184-198-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/insidestevesbrai0000kahn}}, p. 196. Leander cites an oral history audio recording by the Smithsonian Institution as his source for the quotation.</ref>\n\nFor much of Heathkit's history, there were competitors. In electronic kits: [[Allied Electronics|Allied Radio]], an electronic parts supply house, had its KnightKits, [[Lafayette Radio]] offered some kits, [[Radio Shack]] made a few forays into this market with its Archerkit line, [[Dynaco]] made its audio products available in kit form (Dynakits), as did [[H. H. Scott, Inc.]], [[The Fisher (electronics manufacturer)|Fisher]] and [[Eico]]; and later such companies as [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products]].\n\n== Diversification and the digital era ==\n[[File:Heathkit H-8 computer.jpg|thumb|First 8-bit Heathkit H8 computer (1978)]]\n{{anchor|OC-1401}}\n[[File:Heathkit OCW-1401 01A.jpg|thumb|upright|Heathkit Aircraft Navigation Computer OC-1401/OCW-1401 (1978)]]\nAfter the death of Howard Anthony in 1954, Heath was bought by Daystrom Company, a management holding company that also owned several other electronics companies. Daystrom was absorbed by oilfield service company [[Schlumberger Limited]] in 1962, and the Daystrom/Schlumberger days were Heathkit's most successful. Those years saw some \"firsts\" in the general consumer market. The early 1960s saw the introduction of the [[AA-100]] integrated amplifier. The early 1970s saw Heath introduce the [[AJ-1510]], an FM tuner using digital synthesis, and the [[GC-1005]] digital clock. In 1974, Heathkit started \"Heathkit Educational Systems\", which expanded their manuals into general electronics and computer training materials. Heathkit also expanded their expertise into [[Digital data|digital]] and, eventually, computerized equipment, producing among other things [[digital clock]]s and [[weather station]]s with the new technology.<ref name=\"columbiaara.org\"/>\n\nKits were compiled in small batches mostly by hand, using roller assembly lines. These lines were put up and taken down as needed. Some kits were sold completely \"assembled and tested\" in the factory. These models were differentiated with a \"W\" suffix after the model number.\n\nIn 1978 Heathkit introduced the [[Heathkit H8]] computer. The H8 was very successful, as were the [[Heathkit H19|H19]] and [[Heathkit H29|H29]] terminals, and the [[Heathkit H89|H89]] \"All in One\" computer. The H8 and H89 ran their custom operating system, [[HDOS]] and the popular [[CP/M]] operating system. The H89 contained two Zilog [[Z80]] processors, one for the computer and one for the built-in H-19 terminal.<ref>{{cite news| first = Tom | last = Williams| title = Heathkit to Market Computer Products Through Distributors| journal = [[The Intelligent Machines Journal]]| issue = 9| publisher = Jim C.

Zenith purchased Heath for the flexible assembly line infrastructure at the nearby St. Joseph facility as well as the R&D assets.\n\nHeath/Zenith was in the vanguard of companies to start selling personal computers to small business. The H89 kit was re-branded as the [[Zenith Z-89]]/[[Zenith Z-90|Z-90]], an assembled all in one system with a monitor and a [[floppy disk drive]]. They had agreements with Peachtree software to sell a customized \"turn-key\" version of their [[accounting]], CPA and [[real estate management]] software. Shortly after the release of the Z-90, they released a 5MB [[hard disk]] unit and double density external floppy disk drives.\n\nWhile the H11 was popular with hard-core hobbyists, Heath engineers realized that DEC's low-end PDP microprocessors would not be able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems at an affordable price. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel [[8085]]/[[8088]]-based system dubbed the [[Heathkit H100|H100]] (or [[Zenith Z-100|Z-100]], in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the [[CP/M]] operating system, or their OEM version of [[MS-DOS]] named [[Z-DOS]], which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, the competing [[operating system]]s could read each other's disks.\n\nIn 1982 Heath introduced the [[HERO (robot)#HERO 1 (ET-18)|Hero-1]] [[robot]] kit to teach principles of industrial robotics.<ref>Steven Leininger ''Heath's HERO-1 Robot'', ''BYTE'', January 1983 pp. 86-96</ref> The robot included a [[Motorola 6800|Motorola 6808]] processor, ultrasonic sensor, and optionally a manipulator arm; the complete robot could be purchased assembled for $2495 or a basic kit without the arm purchased for $999.  This was the first in a popular series of HeathKit robot kits sold to educational and hobbyist users.\n\n== Kit era comes to a close ==\nWhile Heath/Zenith's computer business was successful, the growing popularity of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits.{{r|lawrence19920330}} Also, while their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products;<ref name=\"pease19920723\">{{Cite magazine |last=Pease |first=Bob |date=1992-07-23 |title=What's All This Muntzing Stuff, Anyhow? |url=http://electronicdesign.com/boards/whats-all-muntzing-stuff-anyhow |magazine=Electronic Design}}</ref> ''BYTE'' reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 [[IBM PC compatible]] cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble.<ref name=\"rash198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Rash |first=Wayne Jr. |date=December 1984 |title=The Zenith Z-150 PC |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n251/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=252\u2013259}}</ref><ref name=\"cohen198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Cohen |first=Henry B. |date=December 1984 |title=Building the H-150 Computer Kit |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n257/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=258}}</ref> The continuation of the integration trend ([[printed circuit board]]s, [[integrated circuit]]s, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to [[surface mount]] components and [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in [[home automation]] and [[lighting]] products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to [[Groupe Bull]] in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.\n\nIn March 1992 Heath announced that it was discontinuing electronic kits after 45 years. The company had been the last large survivor of a dozen kit manufacturers during the 1960s.<ref name=lawrence19920330>{{Cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Fisher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/business/plug-is-pulled-on-heathkits-ending-a-do-it-yourself-era.html |title=Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 March 1992}}</ref> In 1995 Bull sold Heathkit to a private investor group called HIG, which then sold it to another investment group in 1998.

They expanded and enhanced their line of amateur radio gear through nearly four decades.

It was capable of operating [[Continuous wave|CW]] on the six most popular amateur [[short wave]] [[Frequency range|bands]], and sold for $29.50 (equivalent to about $230 in 2009).\n\nThe 39-page catalog contained only two pages of \u201cham gear\u201d.  An antenna coupler was the only other piece of equipment specifically intended for amateur radio use.  The other two items were a general coverage [[short wave]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], the AR-2, and an [[LCR meter|impedance meter]]. A [[VFO]] for the AT-1, the model VF-1, came out the following year.\n\n=== Early DX-series transmitters ===\n[[File:DX100.png|thumb|right|Heathkit DX-100 Amateur Transmitter built in 1958 by W3BOA/W4AHY]]\nThe company's first full featured transmitter, the DX-100, appeared in 1956.  It filled two facing catalog pages, indicating Heathkit's seriousness in building kits for amateurs.  The description noted that it was \u201camateur designed\u201d \u2013 meant to convey expertise in designing specifically for the [[amateur radio operator]] - not the usual sense of the term [[amateur]].  And it stated that \u201camateurs in the field are enthusiastic about praising its performance under actual operating conditions\u201d, indicating that it had been through what we would call [[beta test|beta]] testing today.\n\nHeathkit had been including [[Circuit diagram|schematic diagrams]] of nearly every major kit in its catalog since 1954.  In addition, the DX-100's listing contained two interior pictures and a [[block diagram]].  The 15-tube design could transmit either CW or [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] (voice) with 100 to 140 watts output on all seven short wave amateur bands.  It had a built-in power supply and VFO, and weighed 100 pounds.  Priced at $189.50, it was expensive for the time (about $1,500 in 2009), yet undercut other amateur transmitters having similar features.  It became quite popular.\n\nThe following year they introduced two scaled-down transmitters: the CW-only DX-20 model, meant for beginners, and the DX-35, capable of both CW and AM phone.  Both models covered six bands, only lacking the DX-100's coverage of the 160m (1.8&nbsp;MHz) band.  Although they resembled the DX-100 in appearance, they lacked many of its features.  But at $35.95 and $56.95, they were much more affordable.  The DX-35 was superseded a year later by the improved DX-40.\n\nThe DX-100 was upgraded in 1959 to the DX-100B (there apparently was no DX-100A) and sold for the same price.  By 1960, the catalog advertised it as the \u201cbest watts per dollar value\u201d and called the 5-year-old design \u201cclassic\u201d.\n\n=== Heathkit ''tribes'' ===\n\n==== Apache, Mohawk, Chippewa, Seneca ====\nIn 1959, a year before the last DX-100 was sold, a new ''deluxe'' line of amateur equipment was introduced.  The TX-1 Apache transmitter and the RX-1 Mohawk receiver were about the same size and weight as the DX-100 but had updated styling and a new cabinet (to which the DX-100 also changed).  The transmitter had many more features than its predecessor, and the RX-1 was Heathkit's first full featured amateur band receiver.\n\nBoth units used a \"slide rule dial\" with a scale on a rotating drum that changed with the band selection, and provided more accurate tuning.  Together, Heath's top of the line pair sold for $504.45 (equivalent to nearly $4000 in 2009).\n\nThe SB-10 [[single sideband modulation|SSB]] adapter was introduced in 1959 to enable both the Apache and DX-100 to operate on the new mode.  The next year, a matching kilowatt [[linear amplifier]], the KL-1 Chippewa, was added to the line.  Completing the line, the model VHF-1 Seneca covered the 6 meter (50&nbsp;MHz) and 2 meter (144&nbsp;MHz) bands.\n\n==== Cheyenne, Comanche ====\nThe MT-1 Cheyenne transmitter and MR-1 Comanche receiver were considerably smaller and lighter than the Apache-Mohawk pair.  Used with either an AC or DC external power supply, they could be operated in fixed or mobile service. Without [[transceiver|transceive]] capability, this pair was probably challenging to operate while driving.  A year later these units were reborn as the HX-20 transmitter and HR-20 receiver (and were no longer given names), capable of SSB operation.\n\n==== Marauder, Warrior ====\nThe HX-10 Marauder was a redesigned replacement for the Apache, operating on SSB without an external adapter.  It appeared in the 1962-63 catalog along with a new linear amplifier, the HA-10 Warrior.\n\n==== VHF ====\nThe last new entry in the ''tribes'' generation was the HX-30 transmitter and HA-20 linear amplifier, both capable of SSB operation on the six meter (50&nbsp;MHz) band.\n\nHeathkit also brought out a pair of single band, low power, CW and AM phone VHF transceivers \u2013 the HW-10 and HW-20 for the 6 meter and 2 meter bands, respectively. Designed primarily for mobile use, they were much smaller than the ''tribes'' but bore a strong family resemblance down to their chrome knobs.\n\nIn 1961 they also brought out a distinctive set of low cost, compact, single band transceivers for 6 and 2 meters, the HW-29 and HW-30, also called the ''Sixer'' and ''Twoer''.  Completely self-contained, with a built-in speaker and a matching microphone, they could operate from AC or DC power.  Somewhat limited in features, they were designed for AM phone operation only and frequency control was crystal controlled on transmit.\n\nThese portable transceivers looked distinctly different from other Heathkit gear.  Tan and brown rather than the pervasive green, they were roughly rectangular shaped with rounded corners and had a handle on top.  That particular shape and appearance would lead to them being dubbed the \u201cBenton Harbor Lunchboxes\u201d in the 1966 catalog.\n\n=== New novice station ===\n[[File:Heathkit DX-60B HG-10B 090403.JPG|thumb|Heathkit HG-10B, DX-60B circa 1969]] To succeed the DX-series that started in the 1950s, Heathkit designed an entirely new novice station consisting of the DX-60 transmitter, HR-10 receiver, and HG-10 VFO.  These matching units were smaller and lighter than the ''tribes'', covered five bands, and were much lower priced.  They would go through incremental improvement and sell for more than a decade.  In 1969 Heathkit added the HW-16 to its beginner-level line &ndash; a transceiver designed specifically for the Novice licensee.  It covered the three HF Novice bands, CW only, and was crystal controlled but could be used with the HG-10 VFO.\n\n=== SB-series and HW-series ===\nBy the early 1960s, a large majority of amateurs had adopted SSB as their primary mode of voice communication on the [[high frequency|HF]] bands.  This led to the development of equipment that was specifically designed for transceive operation on SSB, and also much smaller and lighter than the previous generation of ham gear.\n\nAs with other manufacturers, such as [[R. L. Drake Company|Drake]] and [[Rockwell Collins|Collins]], Heathkit began in 1964 by introducing a transceiver.  It covered only one band and came in three models: The HW-12, -22, and -32, covering the 20m (14&nbsp;MHz), 40m (7&nbsp;MHz) and 75m (3.8&nbsp;MHz) bands, respectively.\n\nInfluenced heavily by the ''S/Line'' from Collins, Heathkit designed the SB-series to become their top-line set of amateur radio equipment.  Like the ''S/Line'', these new products were designed to operate together in various combinations as a system. The first models appeared in the 1965 catalog, displacing the large, heavy units of the ''tribes'' generation (except for the Marauder and Warrior, and the 6 meter units which remained for one year).\n\nWhen used together, the SB-300 receiver and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other features of the ''S/Line'', including crystal bandwidth filters and 1&nbsp;kHz tuning dial resolution. They could also operate separately (if the optional crystal pack was installed in the transmitter), giving the operator more flexibility in communicating with foreign stations, aka \"DX Stations\", who were not authorized to transmit within the same frequency ranges as the U.S. stations were authorized to use. The ''S/Line'' influence was easy to ''see'' too, in its cabinet styling, tuning mechanism and knobs.  But by designing them as kits and using less expensive construction, Heathkit could offer these units at much lower prices.  The pair sold for $590 that first year (equivalent to about ${{Inflation|US|590|1965|r=-2}} today).  The matching SB-200 1,200-watt input/700-800-watt output linear amplifier completed the line for 1965.\n\nThe following year two more units were added: the SB-110 transceiver for the 6 meter band and the HA-14 \u201cKompact Kilowatt\u201d, a smaller kilowatt linear amplifier based on the SB-200. The HA-14 also used grounded grid 572Bs but with external AC and DC power supplies. At 7 lbs the amplifier itself was very small, matching the HW mono-banders in style, and usable in both mobile and desktop service. Like the SB-200 from which it derived, its input was designed to match the 100-watt output of the Heathkit SB and HW series plus as Collins and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qsl.net/w6ovp/|title=HA-14 . W6OVP KW Kompact Heathkit|website=www.qsl.net|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heathkit SB-101 090403.JPG|thumb|Heathkit SB-101 transceiver, circa 1968]]\nIn a last minute, four page, center insert to the 1966 catalog titled \u201cNew Product News\u201d Heathkit announced the SB-100 five-band SSB transceiver. Like the other transceivers of this time, the SB-100 (and later improved models SB-101 and SB-102) would become one of Heathkit's best selling amateur radio products.  This included a scaled-back, lower priced version of the SB-100 called the HW-100 (later updated to the HW-101) introduced in 1969. While the SB series were affectionately nicknamed the \"Sugar Baker\" series, the HW series were affectionately nicknamed the \"Hot Water\" series.\n\nIn the next three years, Heathkit brought out several more SB-series accessories, including a 2 kilowatt input/1.4 kilowatt output linear amplifier, the SB-220. The SB-400 model transmitter was slightly updated with the newer SB-401 model. The final model in the original SB-series was the SB-303 receiver, a solid state replacement (in a smaller case) for the SB-301 and its earlier sibling, the SB-300 receiver. The 2000 film ''[[Frequency (film)|Frequency]]'', starring  [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Jim Caviezel]], featured a Heathkit SB-301 receiver being used with [[artistic license]] as a transceiver ([[Theatrical property|film studio prop]]), although the SB-301 did not have any transmitter stages in it and was not a transceiver. An SB-302 receiver was never produced (no reason ever given for why the 302 model number was skipped) and some hams who worked at Heath hinted that there was talk of a solid state SB-103 transceiver, but it never made it past the proposal stage.\n\nThe SB-series would continue to be improved and sell well until 1974 and the arrival of solid state and digital design, with the SB-104 transceiver, its accessories and a new generation of amateur radio gear. Though somewhat redesigned physically it had a similar appearance to the earlier SB-series generation. The SB-670 was a short-lived dream antenna tuner that matched the SB-104. Unfortunately, only a few were produced and those were considered \"prototypes\".<ref>The New 1954 Heathkit Catalog, Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkits for 1955 through 1960 (catalogs), Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkit Catalog, Fall and Winter 1962-63, Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkit 1964 through 1971 (catalogs), Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref> However, technical issues with the first production run of the SB-104 led to Heath having to quickly update it with the SB-104A. By that time, amateurs were buying transceivers made overseas being produced for the same amount of money with more features (including the AM and FM modes that the Heathkit SB and HW series did not have) and did not require user assembly.\n\nIn 1983 Heathkit came out with their last ham radio kit, the HW-5400 transceiver. It was all solid state with 100 watts output on 160 through 10 meters including the newly-available [[WARC bands]]. Also available was a matching power supply.\n\n=== Solid state and digital ===\nIn the late 1970s Heathkit redesigned the line again, bringing out a series of transceivers and separates with more advanced digital features and new styling (abandoning the green motif, a distinguishing feature of Heathkits for more than two decades).\n\nDuring the 1980s, with increasing competition primarily from Japanese equipment makers, wide use of automated manufacturing techniques, and increasingly complex designs, it became much more difficult to produce kits that were both easy to construct and feature-rich at a competitive price.  Heathkit began to introduce models that were unavailable in kit form such as the SS-9000. The SS-9000 is an all solid-state, synthesized transceiver covering 160 through 10 meters (including the WARC bands) with 100 watts output. A total of 375 were produced according to the Yahoo Heath user group. This continued until they left the electronic kit business in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathkit-museum.com/|title=The Heathkit Virtual Museum|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928075950/http://www.heathkit-museum.com/|archive-date=28 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> {{as of|2019}}, the Heathkit company has been revived, and is offering both newly-designed and vintage products for the amateur radio market.<ref name=\"HeathNew\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of personal computers]]\n* [[Homebuilt aircraft]]\n* [[Vintage amateur radio]]\n* [[HERO (robot)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite news |last=Post |first=Rich |url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm |title=The Heathkit Legacy |work=Monitoring Times |date=July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222174113/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=1995 |title=Heathkit:  A Guide to the Amateur Radio Products |publisher=Electric Radio Press |location=Durango, Colorado |oclc=34615100}}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=2003 |title=Heathkit:  A Guide to the Amateur Radio Products |edition=2nd |publisher=CQ Communications |location=Hicksville, New York |isbn=978-0943016238}}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=2014 |title=Heathkit Test Equipment Products   |isbn=978-0615991337}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Heathkit}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.heathkit.com/}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080928075950/http://www.heathkit-museum.com/ Heathkit Virtual Museum]\n*[http://www.nostalgickitscentral.com/heath/heathkit.html Heathkit Information], at Nostalgic Kits Central\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091220192850/http://rigreference.com/heathkit Heathkit], at RigReference.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150222174113/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm The Heathkit Legacy (KB8TAD 2013)]\n\n[[Category:Amateur radio companies]]\n[[Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Electronic kit manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Electronic calculator companies]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Electronics companies established in 1926]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2012]]\n[[Category:American brands]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:2012 disestablishments in Michigan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Brand name of kits and other electronic products produced and marketed by the Heath Company}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2016}}\n{{advert|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Heath Company\n| logo = File:Heathkit_Logo.jpg\n| logo_size =\n| logo_alt =\n| logo_caption = \n| logo_padding =\n| image = \n| image_size =\n| image_alt =\n| image_caption = \n| native_name = \n| native_name_lang =    <!-- Use ISO 639-1 code, e.g. \"fr\" for French.

After [[World War II]], Anthony decided that entering the electronics industry was a good idea, and bought a large stock of surplus wartime electronic parts with the intention of building kits with them. In 1947, Heath introduced its first [[electronic kit]], the O1 [[oscilloscope]] that sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]50\u2014the price was unbeatable at the time, and the oscilloscope went on to be a huge seller.<ref name=\"columbiaara.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaara.org/CNL/CN200011.pdf |last=Rostky |first=George |title=A Tale Of The Unstoppable Electronic Kit |work=[[EE Times]] |date=2 October 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210656/http://www.columbiaara.org/CNL/CN200011.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Heathkit product concept ==\n[[File:Io12u.jpg|thumb|upright|Heathkit IO12U oscilloscope built in 1967]]\nAfter the success of the oscilloscope kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchasers could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a significantly lower cash cost and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it themselves.  During those decades, the premise was basically valid. Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as [[vacuum tube]]s, tube sockets, capacitors, inductors and [[resistor]]s, and essentially hand-wired and assembled. The home kit-builder could perform these assembly tasks himself, and, if careful, to at least the same standard of quality. In the case of their most expensive product, the [[Thomas Organ Company|Thomas electronic organ]], building the Heathkit version represented substantial savings.\n\nOne category in which Heathkit enjoyed great popularity was [[amateur radio]]. [[Ham radio operator]]s had frequently been forced to [[Amateur radio homebrew|build their equipment from scratch]] before the advent of kits, with the difficulty of procuring all the parts separately and relying on often-experimental designs. Kits brought the convenience of all parts being supplied together and the assurance of a predictable finished product; many Heathkit models became well known in the ham radio community. The HW-101 HF transceiver became so ubiquitous that even today the \"Hot Water One-Oh-One\" can be found in use, or purchased as used equipment at [[hamfest]]s, decades after it went out of production.\n\n[[File:HeathkitAA141f-19710220.jpg|left|thumb|Heathkit AA141 stereo preamplifier, 1962.]]In the case of electronic test equipment, Heathkits often filled a low-end niche.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe instruction books were regarded as the best in the kit industry, being models of clarity, beginning with basic lessons on [[soldering]] technique, and proceeding with explicit directions, illustrated with line drawings: the drawings opened out so as to be opposite the relevant text (which might be several pages away) and were aligned with the assembler's eye position. Also in view was a box to check as each task was accomplished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/whatever-happened-to-heathkit-20689 |work=Electronic Design |date=February 18, 2009 |title=Whatever Happened To Heathkit? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229095811/http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/whatever-happened-to-heathkit-20689 |archivedate=December 29, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Heathkits as education==\n[[File:HeathkitAA141w-19710220.jpg|left|thumb|The wiring of a Heathkit AA141 stereo preamplifier, 1962.]]No knowledge of electronics was needed to assemble a Heathkit. The assembly process did not teach much about electronics, but provided a great deal of what could have been called \"electronics literacy\", such as the ability to identify tube pin numbers or read a [[Electronic color code|resistor color code]].  Many hobbyists began by assembling Heathkits, became familiar with the appearance of components like [[capacitor]]s, [[transformer]]s, resistors, and tubes, and were motivated to find out just what these components actually did. For those builders who had a deeper knowledge of electronics (or for those who wanted to be able to troubleshoot/repair the product in the future), the assembly manuals usually included a detailed \"Theory of Operation\" chapter, which explained the functioning of the kit's circuitry, section by section. Heath developed a relationship with electronics correspondence schools (e.g., [[National Radio Institute|NRI]]). Heath supplied electronic kits to be assembled as part of courses, with the school basing its texts and lessons around the kit.\n\nHeathkits could teach deeper lessons. \"The kits taught [[Steve Jobs]] that products were manifestations of human ingenuity, not magical objects dropped from the sky\", writes a business author, who goes on to quote Jobs as saying \"It gave a tremendous level of self-confidence, that through exploration and learning one could understand seemingly very complex things in one's environment.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Steve's Brain|author=Leander Kahney|publisher=Portfolio|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59184-198-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/insidestevesbrai0000kahn}}, p. 196. Leander cites an oral history audio recording by the Smithsonian Institution as his source for the quotation.</ref>\n\nFor much of Heathkit's history, there were competitors. In electronic kits: [[Allied Electronics|Allied Radio]], an electronic parts supply house, had its KnightKits, [[Lafayette Radio]] offered some kits, [[Radio Shack]] made a few forays into this market with its Archerkit line, [[Dynaco]] made its audio products available in kit form (Dynakits), as did [[H. H. Scott, Inc.]], [[The Fisher (electronics manufacturer)|Fisher]] and [[Eico]]; and later such companies as [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products]].\n\n== Diversification and the digital era ==\n[[File:Heathkit H-8 computer.jpg|thumb|First 8-bit Heathkit H8 computer (1978)]]\n{{anchor|OC-1401}}\n[[File:Heathkit OCW-1401 01A.jpg|thumb|upright|Heathkit Aircraft Navigation Computer OC-1401/OCW-1401 (1978)]]\nAfter the death of Howard Anthony in 1954, Heath was bought by Daystrom Company, a management holding company that also owned several other electronics companies. Daystrom was absorbed by oilfield service company [[Schlumberger Limited]] in 1962, and the Daystrom/Schlumberger days were Heathkit's most successful. Those years saw some \"firsts\" in the general consumer market. The early 1960s saw the introduction of the [[AA-100]] integrated amplifier. The early 1970s saw Heath introduce the [[AJ-1510]], an FM tuner using digital synthesis, and the [[GC-1005]] digital clock. In 1974, Heathkit started \"Heathkit Educational Systems\", which expanded their manuals into general electronics and computer training materials. Heathkit also expanded their expertise into [[Digital data|digital]] and, eventually, computerized equipment, producing among other things [[digital clock]]s and [[weather station]]s with the new technology.<ref name=\"columbiaara.org\"/>\n\nKits were compiled in small batches mostly by hand, using roller assembly lines. These lines were put up and taken down as needed. Some kits were sold completely \"assembled and tested\" in the factory. These models were differentiated with a \"W\" suffix after the model number.\n\nIn 1978 Heathkit introduced the [[Heathkit H8]] computer. The H8 was very successful, as were the [[Heathkit H19|H19]] and [[Heathkit H29|H29]] terminals, and the [[Heathkit H89|H89]] \"All in One\" computer. The H8 and H89 ran their custom operating system, [[HDOS]] and the popular [[CP/M]] operating system.

Zenith purchased Heath for the flexible assembly line infrastructure at the nearby St. Joseph facility as well as the R&D assets.\n\nHeath/Zenith was in the vanguard of companies to start selling personal computers to small business. The H89 kit was re-branded as the [[Zenith Z-89]]/[[Zenith Z-90|Z-90]], an assembled all in one system with a monitor and a [[floppy disk drive]]. They had agreements with Peachtree software to sell a customized \"turn-key\" version of their [[accounting]], CPA and [[real estate management]] software. Shortly after the release of the Z-90, they released a 5MB [[hard disk]] unit and double density external floppy disk drives.\n\nWhile the H11 was popular with hard-core hobbyists, Heath engineers realized that DEC's low-end PDP microprocessors would not be able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems at an affordable price. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel [[8085]]/[[8088]]-based system dubbed the [[Heathkit H100|H100]] (or [[Zenith Z-100|Z-100]], in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the [[CP/M]] operating system, or their OEM version of [[MS-DOS]] named [[Z-DOS]], which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, the competing [[operating system]]s could read each other's disks.\n\nIn 1982 Heath introduced the [[HERO (robot)#HERO 1 (ET-18)|Hero-1]] [[robot]] kit to teach principles of industrial robotics.<ref>Steven Leininger ''Heath's HERO-1 Robot'', ''BYTE'', January 1983 pp. 86-96</ref> The robot included a [[Motorola 6800|Motorola 6808]] processor, ultrasonic sensor, and optionally a manipulator arm; the complete robot could be purchased assembled for $2495 or a basic kit without the arm purchased for $999.  This was the first in a popular series of HeathKit robot kits sold to educational and hobbyist users.\n\n== Kit era comes to a close ==\nWhile Heath/Zenith's computer business was successful, the growing popularity of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits.{{r|lawrence19920330}} Also, while their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products;<ref name=\"pease19920723\">{{Cite magazine |last=Pease |first=Bob |date=1992-07-23 |title=What's All This Muntzing Stuff, Anyhow? |url=http://electronicdesign.com/boards/whats-all-muntzing-stuff-anyhow |magazine=Electronic Design}}</ref> ''BYTE'' reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 [[IBM PC compatible]] cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble.<ref name=\"rash198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Rash |first=Wayne Jr. |date=December 1984 |title=The Zenith Z-150 PC |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n251/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=252\u2013259}}</ref><ref name=\"cohen198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Cohen |first=Henry B. |date=December 1984 |title=Building the H-150 Computer Kit |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n257/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=258}}</ref> The continuation of the integration trend ([[printed circuit board]]s, [[integrated circuit]]s, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to [[surface mount]] components and [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in [[home automation]] and [[lighting]] products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to [[Groupe Bull]] in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.\n\nIn March 1992 Heath announced that it was discontinuing electronic kits after 45 years. The company had been the last large survivor of a dozen kit manufacturers during the 1960s.<ref name=lawrence19920330>{{Cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Fisher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/business/plug-is-pulled-on-heathkits-ending-a-do-it-yourself-era.html |title=Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 March 1992}}</ref> In 1995 Bull sold Heathkit to a private investor group called HIG, which then sold it to another investment group in 1998.

In addition to their low prices compared with commercially manufactured equipment, Heathkits appealed to amateurs who had an interest in building their own equipment, but did not necessarily have the expertise or desire to design it and obtain all the parts themselves. They expanded and enhanced their line of amateur radio gear through nearly four decades.  By the late 1960s, Heathkit had as large a selection of [[Etymology of ham radio|ham]] equipment as any company in the field.\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThey entered the market in 1954 with the AT-1, a simple, three [[vacuum tube|tube]], [[Crystal oscillator|crystal controlled]] [[transmitter]].  It was capable of operating [[Continuous wave|CW]] on the six most popular amateur [[short wave]] [[Frequency range|bands]], and sold for $29.50 (equivalent to about $230 in 2009).\n\nThe 39-page catalog contained only two pages of \u201cham gear\u201d.  An antenna coupler was the only other piece of equipment specifically intended for amateur radio use.  The other two items were a general coverage [[short wave]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], the AR-2, and an [[LCR meter|impedance meter]]. A [[VFO]] for the AT-1, the model VF-1, came out the following year.\n\n=== Early DX-series transmitters ===\n[[File:DX100.png|thumb|right|Heathkit DX-100 Amateur Transmitter built in 1958 by W3BOA/W4AHY]]\nThe company's first full featured transmitter, the DX-100, appeared in 1956.  It filled two facing catalog pages, indicating Heathkit's seriousness in building kits for amateurs.  The description noted that it was \u201camateur designed\u201d \u2013 meant to convey expertise in designing specifically for the [[amateur radio operator]] - not the usual sense of the term [[amateur]].  And it stated that \u201camateurs in the field are enthusiastic about praising its performance under actual operating conditions\u201d, indicating that it had been through what we would call [[beta test|beta]] testing today.\n\nHeathkit had been including [[Circuit diagram|schematic diagrams]] of nearly every major kit in its catalog since 1954.  In addition, the DX-100's listing contained two interior pictures and a [[block diagram]].  The 15-tube design could transmit either CW or [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] (voice) with 100 to 140 watts output on all seven short wave amateur bands.  It had a built-in power supply and VFO, and weighed 100 pounds.  Priced at $189.50, it was expensive for the time (about $1500 in 2009), yet undercut other amateur transmitters having similar features.  It became quite popular.\n\nThe following year they introduced two scaled-down transmitters: the CW-only DX-20 model, meant for beginners, and the DX-35, capable of both CW and AM phone.  Both models covered six bands, only lacking the DX-100's coverage of the 160m (1.8&nbsp;MHz) band.  Although they resembled the DX-100 in appearance, they lacked many of its features.  But at $35.95 and $56.95, they were much more affordable.  The DX-35 was superseded a year later by the improved DX-40.\n\nThe DX-100 was upgraded in 1959 to the DX-100B (there apparently was no DX-100A) and sold for the same price.  By 1960, the catalog advertised it as the \u201cbest watts per dollar value\u201d and called the 5-year-old design \u201cclassic\u201d.\n\n=== Heathkit ''tribes'' ===\n\n==== Apache, Mohawk, Chippewa, Seneca ====\nIn 1959, a year before the last DX-100 was sold, a new ''deluxe'' line of amateur equipment was introduced.  The TX-1 Apache transmitter and the RX-1 Mohawk receiver were about the same size and weight as the DX-100 but had updated styling and a new cabinet (to which the DX-100 also changed).  The transmitter had many more features than its predecessor, and the RX-1 was Heathkit's first full featured amateur band receiver.\n\nBoth units used a \"slide rule dial\" with a scale on a rotating drum that changed with the band selection, and provided more accurate tuning.  Together, Heath's top of the line pair sold for $504.45 (equivalent to nearly $4000 in 2009).\n\nThe SB-10 [[single sideband modulation|SSB]] adapter was introduced in 1959 to enable both the Apache and DX-100 to operate on the new mode.  The next year, a matching kilowatt [[linear amplifier]], the KL-1 Chippewa, was added to the line.  Completing the line, the model VHF-1 Seneca covered the 6 meter (50&nbsp;MHz) and 2 meter (144&nbsp;MHz) bands.\n\n==== Cheyenne, Comanche ====\nThe MT-1 Cheyenne transmitter and MR-1 Comanche receiver were considerably smaller and lighter than the Apache-Mohawk pair.  Used with either an AC or DC external power supply, they could be operated in fixed or mobile service. Without [[transceiver|transceive]] capability, this pair was probably challenging to operate while driving.  A year later these units were reborn as the HX-20 transmitter and HR-20 receiver (and were no longer given names), capable of SSB operation.\n\n==== Marauder, Warrior ====\nThe HX-10 Marauder was a redesigned replacement for the Apache, operating on SSB without an external adapter.  It appeared in the 1962-63 catalog along with a new linear amplifier, the HA-10 Warrior.\n\n==== VHF ====\nThe last new entry in the ''tribes'' generation was the HX-30 transmitter and HA-20 linear amplifier, both capable of SSB operation on the six meter (50&nbsp;MHz) band.\n\nHeathkit also brought out a pair of single band, low power, CW and AM phone VHF transceivers \u2013 the HW-10 and HW-20 for the 6 meter and 2 meter bands, respectively. Designed primarily for mobile use, they were much smaller than the ''tribes'' but bore a strong family resemblance down to their chrome knobs.\n\nIn 1961 they also brought out a distinctive set of low cost, compact, single band transceivers for 6 and 2 meters, the HW-29 and HW-30, also called the ''Sixer'' and ''Twoer''.  Completely self-contained, with a built-in speaker and a matching microphone, they could operate from AC or DC power.  Somewhat limited in features, they were designed for AM phone operation only and frequency control was crystal controlled on transmit.\n\nThese portable transceivers looked distinctly different from other Heathkit gear.  Tan and brown rather than the pervasive green, they were roughly rectangular shaped with rounded corners and had a handle on top.  That particular shape and appearance would lead to them being dubbed the \u201cBenton Harbor Lunchboxes\u201d in the 1966 catalog.\n\n=== New novice station ===\n[[File:Heathkit DX-60B HG-10B 090403.JPG|thumb|Heathkit HG-10B, DX-60B circa 1969]] To succeed the DX-series that started in the 1950s, Heathkit designed an entirely new novice station consisting of the DX-60 transmitter, HR-10 receiver, and HG-10 VFO.  These matching units were smaller and lighter than the ''tribes'', covered five bands, and were much lower priced.  They would go through incremental improvement and sell for more than a decade.  In 1969 Heathkit added the HW-16 to its beginner-level line &ndash; a transceiver designed specifically for the Novice licensee.  It covered the three HF Novice bands, CW only, and was crystal controlled but could be used with the HG-10 VFO.\n\n=== SB-series and HW-series ===\nBy the early 1960s, a large majority of amateurs had adopted SSB as their primary mode of voice communication on the [[high frequency|HF]] bands.  This led to the development of equipment that was specifically designed for transceive operation on SSB, and also much smaller and lighter than the previous generation of ham gear.\n\nAs with other manufacturers, such as [[R. L. Drake Company|Drake]] and [[Rockwell Collins|Collins]], Heathkit began in 1964 by introducing a transceiver.  It covered only one band and came in three models: The HW-12, -22, and -32, covering the 20m (14&nbsp;MHz), 40m (7&nbsp;MHz) and 75m (3.8&nbsp;MHz) bands, respectively.\n\nInfluenced heavily by the ''S/Line'' from Collins, Heathkit designed the SB-series to become their top-line set of amateur radio equipment.  Like the ''S/Line'', these new products were designed to operate together in various combinations as a system. The first models appeared in the 1965 catalog, displacing the large, heavy units of the ''tribes'' generation (except for the Marauder and Warrior, and the 6 meter units which remained for one year).\n\nWhen used together, the SB-300 receiver and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other features of the ''S/Line'', including crystal bandwidth filters and 1&nbsp;kHz tuning dial resolution. They could also operate separately (if the optional crystal pack was installed in the transmitter), giving the operator more flexibility in communicating with foreign stations, aka \"DX Stations\", who were not authorized to transmit within the same frequency ranges as the U.S. stations were authorized to use. The ''S/Line'' influence was easy to ''see'' too, in its cabinet styling, tuning mechanism and knobs.  But by designing them as kits and using less expensive construction, Heathkit could offer these units at much lower prices.  The pair sold for $590 that first year (equivalent to about ${{Inflation|US|590|1965|r=-2}} today).  The matching SB-200 1,200-watt input/700-800-watt output linear amplifier completed the line for 1965.\n\nThe following year two more units were added: the SB-110 transceiver for the 6 meter band and the HA-14 \u201cKompact Kilowatt\u201d, a smaller kilowatt linear amplifier based on the SB-200. The HA-14 also used grounded grid 572Bs but with external AC and DC power supplies. At 7 lbs the amplifier itself was very small, matching the HW mono-banders in style, and usable in both mobile and desktop service. Like the SB-200 from which it derived, its input was designed to match the 100-watt output of the Heathkit SB and HW series plus as Collins and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qsl.net/w6ovp/|title=HA-14 . W6OVP KW Kompact Heathkit|website=www.qsl.net|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heathkit SB-101 090403.JPG|thumb|Heathkit SB-101 transceiver, circa 1968]]\nIn a last minute, four page, center insert to the 1966 catalog titled \u201cNew Product News\u201d Heathkit announced the SB-100 five-band SSB transceiver. Like the other transceivers of this time, the SB-100 (and later improved models SB-101 and SB-102) would become one of Heathkit's best selling amateur radio products.  This included a scaled-back, lower priced version of the SB-100 called the HW-100 (later updated to the HW-101) introduced in 1969. While the SB series were affectionately nicknamed the \"Sugar Baker\" series, the HW series were affectionately nicknamed the \"Hot Water\" series.\n\nIn the next three years, Heathkit brought out several more SB-series accessories, including a 2 kilowatt input/1.4 kilowatt output linear amplifier, the SB-220. The SB-400 model transmitter was slightly updated with the newer SB-401 model. The final model in the original SB-series was the SB-303 receiver, a solid state replacement (in a smaller case) for the SB-301 and its earlier sibling, the SB-300 receiver. The 2000 film ''[[Frequency (film)|Frequency]]'', starring  [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Jim Caviezel]], featured a Heathkit SB-301 receiver being used with [[artistic license]] as a transceiver ([[Theatrical property|film studio prop]]), although the SB-301 did not have any transmitter stages in it and was not a transceiver. An SB-302 receiver was never produced (no reason ever given for why the 302 model number was skipped) and some hams who worked at Heath hinted that there was talk of a solid state SB-103 transceiver, but it never made it past the proposal stage.\n\nThe SB-series would continue to be improved and sell well until 1974 and the arrival of solid state and digital design, with the SB-104 transceiver, its accessories and a new generation of amateur radio gear. Though somewhat redesigned physically it had a similar appearance to the earlier SB-series generation. The SB-670 was a short-lived dream antenna tuner that matched the SB-104. Unfortunately, only a few were produced and those were considered \"prototypes\".<ref>The New 1954 Heathkit Catalog, Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkits for 1955 through 1960 (catalogs), Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkit Catalog, Fall and Winter 1962-63, Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref><ref>Heathkit 1964 through 1971 (catalogs), Heath Company, Benton Harbor, MI</ref> However, technical issues with the first production run of the SB-104 led to Heath having to quickly update it with the SB-104A. By that time, amateurs were buying transceivers made overseas being produced for the same amount of money with more features (including the AM and FM modes that the Heathkit SB and HW series did not have) and did not require user assembly.\n\nIn 1983 Heathkit came out with their last ham radio kit, the HW-5400 transceiver. It was all solid state with 100 watts output on 160 through 10 meters including the newly-available [[WARC bands]]. Also available was a matching power supply.\n\n=== Solid state and digital ===\nIn the late 1970s Heathkit redesigned the line again, bringing out a series of transceivers and separates with more advanced digital features and new styling (abandoning the green motif, a distinguishing feature of Heathkits for more than two decades).\n\nDuring the 1980s, with increasing competition primarily from Japanese equipment makers, wide use of automated manufacturing techniques, and increasingly complex designs, it became much more difficult to produce kits that were both easy to construct and feature-rich at a competitive price.  Heathkit began to introduce models that were unavailable in kit form such as the SS-9000. The SS-9000 is an all solid-state, synthesized transceiver covering 160 through 10 meters (including the WARC bands) with 100 watts output. A total of 375 were produced according to the Yahoo Heath user group. This continued until they left the electronic kit business in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathkit-museum.com/|title=The Heathkit Virtual Museum|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928075950/http://www.heathkit-museum.com/|archive-date=28 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> {{as of|2019}}, the Heathkit company has been revived, and is offering both newly-designed and vintage products for the amateur radio market.<ref name=\"HeathNew\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of personal computers]]\n* [[Homebuilt aircraft]]\n* [[Vintage amateur radio]]\n* [[HERO (robot)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite news |last=Post |first=Rich |url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm |title=The Heathkit Legacy |work=Monitoring Times |date=July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222174113/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=1995 |title=Heathkit:  A Guide to the Amateur Radio Products |publisher=Electric Radio Press |location=Durango, Colorado |oclc=34615100}}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=2003 |title=Heathkit:  A Guide to the Amateur Radio Products |edition=2nd |publisher=CQ Communications |location=Hicksville, New York |isbn=978-0943016238}}\n*{{cite book |last=Penson |first=Chuck |year=2014 |title=Heathkit Test Equipment Products   |isbn=978-0615991337}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Heathkit}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.heathkit.com/}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080928075950/http://www.heathkit-museum.com/ Heathkit Virtual Museum]\n*[http://www.nostalgickitscentral.com/heath/heathkit.html Heathkit Information], at Nostalgic Kits Central\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091220192850/http://rigreference.com/heathkit Heathkit], at RigReference.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150222174113/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/HLegacy.htm The Heathkit Legacy (KB8TAD 2013)]\n\n[[Category:Amateur radio companies]]\n[[Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Electronic kit manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Electronic calculator companies]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Electronics companies established in 1926]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2012]]\n[[Category:American brands]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:2012 disestablishments in Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly DX-series transmitters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit"}
