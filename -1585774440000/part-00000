In particular it shows the lives of [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Canadian]] settlers from the years 1899 to 1930. Buildings from surrounding communities have been moved to the historic site and restored to various years within the first part of the twentieth century.\n\n\"The Village\", as it is colloquially known, has a very strong commitment to [[Authenticity (reenactment)|historical authenticity]] and the concept of [[living history]].  The Village uses a technique known as [[first-person interpretation]] which requires that the costumed performers remain ''in character'' at all times (or as much as is feasibly possible).  Actors answer all questions as if it is the year their building portrays.  Although this technique is startling for some visitors at first, it allows for a much stronger experience of immersion in history than traditional [[third-person interpretation]] where the actor acknowledges that he is, in fact, in a museum.\n[[File:UCHV elevator.jpg|thumb|right|Home Grain Co.

His third house in Canada is preserved at the Village.  The second house is that of Mykhailo and Vaselina Hawreliak.  The Hawreliaks were a large Ukrainian Bukovynian family who settled in the Shandro area. By the 1920s Mykhailo Hawreliak was quite successful, and the house preserved here has five bedrooms and a [[cistern]] that collected [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater]] for use in the kitchen.

In particular it shows the lives of [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Canadian]] settlers from the years 1899 to 1930. Buildings from surrounding communities have been moved to the historic site and restored to various years within the first part of the twentieth century.\n\n\"The Village\", as it is colloquially known, has a very strong commitment to [[Authenticity (reenactment)|historical authenticity]] and the concept of [[living history]].  The Village uses a technique known as [[first-person interpretation]] which requires that the costumed performers remain ''in character'' at all times (or as much as is feasibly possible).  Actors answer all questions as if it is the year their building portrays.  Although this technique is startling for some visitors at first, it allows for a much stronger experience of immersion in history than traditional [[third-person interpretation]] where the actor acknowledges that he is, in fact, in a museum.\n[[File:UCHV elevator.jpg|thumb|right|Home Grain Co.

His third house in Canada is preserved at the Village.  The second house is that of Mykhailo and Vaselina Hawreliak.  The Hawreliaks were a large Ukrainian Bukovynian family who settled in the Shandro area. By the 1920s Mykhailo Hawreliak was quite successful, and the house preserved here has five bedrooms and a [[cistern]] that collected [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater]] for use in the kitchen.

As Prine biographer Eddie Huffman observes, ''Sweet Revenge'' was a full-band LP recorded in Tennessee, but the singer had grown dramatically as a vocalist and recording artist over the previous two years.  He sounded fully integrated with the backing musicians this go-around...\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=88|2015}} Two songs, \"Blue Umbrella\" and \"Onomatopoeia\", were recorded at [[Atlantic Recording Studios]] in [[New York City]] while \"Dear Abby\" was cut live at a gig at New York's [[State University]]. \"Dear Abby\" was attempted in the studio but, as Prine told David Fricke in 1993, \"The studio version of that was cut with a band, and it was real stiff and humorless.  We cut it once, live, and that was it.  That was the power of the song, in the way people would turn their heads the minute I'd get to the first verse, the first chords. That was the  reason we used the live version.\" The album features many of the same musicians who played on Prine's debut album, along with [[Cissy Houston]], who was a member of the Elvis Presley accompaniment group, the [[Sweet Inspirations]], and Houston, Deidre Tuck, and Judy Clay sing with Prine on the title track's call-and-response sections, adding a soulful blend to Prine's ragged hillbilly edge.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=86|2015}}  \n\"Sweet Revenge\" quotes a line from [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail'' and reflects some of Prine's frustrations with how his second album was received, commenting in the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes, \"I'd quit my job at the post office, I had this album out that got incredible reviews, and then this second one where the critics started to hit me. I think it got under my skin.\"\n\nIn the liner notes to ''John Prine Live'', Prine writes that \"Mexican Home\" was partially inspired by his father Bill sitting on his front porch in Maywood, Illinois, while \"Grandpa Was A Carpenter\" was his homage to his grandfather Empson Schobie Prine. \"Christmas in Prison\" mixed humor with pathos, romantic longing with some of Prine's most cinematic imagery to date.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=87|2015}}  In the ''Great Days'' liner notes, Prine writes of the tune, \"It's about a person being somewhere like a prison, in a situation they don't want to be in. And wishing they were somewhere else. But I used all the imagery as if it were an actual prison, with the lights swinging around the yard, the food tasting bad, making guns out of wood or soap. And being a sentimental guy, I put it at Christmas.\"  \"Please Don't Bury Me\" was a rollicking country toe-tapper with some intricate guitar interplay but had been redrafted, with Prine recalling in ''Great Days'', \u201cThat song was originally about this character I had in mind called Tom Brewster. He dies but he wasn't {{sic|suppose}} to, like that scene in those old movies. The angels have to send him back, but they can't the way he is. So they send him back as a rooster.  Which is why his name is Brewster. I ended up trashing that whole part and came up with this idea of the guy just giving all of his organs away, and I made a whole song out of that.\u201d\n\nThe album cover is a far cry from the somewhat naive portraits of the singer on his first two LPs: a bearded, demin-clad Prine - wearing sunglasses and pointy-toed cowboy boots, a cigarette jutting from his lips - sprawls across the leather front seats of a 1959 Porsche convertible, the \"first toy\" the singer purchased with his record company money.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=89|2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Smith |title= ''Sweet Revenge'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15820 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\n''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote: \"Prine is described as surrealistic and/or political even though the passion of his literalness is matched only by that of his detachment: inferential leaps and tall songs do not a dreamscape make, and Prine offers neither program nor protest.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> Writing for [[Allmusic]], critic Jim Smith wrote of the album \"Sympathy takes a back seat to cynicism here, and while that strips the record of some depth, Prine's irreverence is consistently thrilling, making this one of his best.

Usage of N\u22c5m is discouraged by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|SI authority]], since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/2-2-2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420184231/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/2-2-2.html |archive-date=2013-04-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNon-SI units of work include the newton-metre, [[erg]], the [[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound]], the [[foot-poundal]], the [[kilowatt hour]], the [[litre-atmosphere]], and the [[horsepower|horsepower-hour]].  Due to work having the same [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] as [[heat]], occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as [[therm]], [[BTU]] and [[Calorie]], are utilized as a measuring unit.\n\n==Work and energy==\nThe work <math>W</math> done by a constant force of magnitude <math>F</math> on a point that moves a displacement <math>s</math> in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product\n:<math>W = F s</math>.\n\nFor example, if a force of 10 newtons (<math>F</math> = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres (<math>s</math> = 2 m), then <math>W = F s = (10\\ \\mathrm N)(2\\ \\mathrm m) = 20\\ \\mathrm J.</math> This is approximately the work done lifting a 1&nbsp;kg object from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravity.\n\nThe work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.\n\nWork is closely related to [[energy]]. The work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force.\n\nFrom [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy <math>KE</math> of the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body,\n:<math>W = \\Delta KE.</math>\nThe work of forces generated by a potential function is known as [[potential energy]] and the forces are said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force [[Field (physics)|field]], without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to ''minus'' the change of potential energy <math>PE</math> of the object,\n:<math>W = -\\Delta PE.</math>\nThese formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]], and units, of energy.\nThe work/energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work/energy principles.\n\n==Constraint forces==\nConstraint forces limit the movement of components in a system, such as constraining an object to a surface (in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is ''stuck to'' the slope, when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter').  Constraint forces restrict the velocity in the direction of the constraint to zero, which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.\n\nFor a [[Virtual work|mechanical system]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Goldstein, Classical Mechanics, third edition. P.19</ref> constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraint. Thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, because the component of velocity along the constraint force at each point of application is zero. For example, in a pulley system like the [[Atwood machine]], the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system. Therefore work need only be computed for the gravity forces acting on the bodies.\n\nFor example, the [[centripetal force]] exerted ''inwards'' by a string on a ball in uniform [[circular motion]] ''sideways'' constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle.  This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.\n\nAnother example is a book on a table.   If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table, then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards.  The force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work.\n\nThe [[magnetic force]] on a charged particle is {{nowrap|1='''F''' = ''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}, where ''q'' is the charge, '''v''' is the velocity of the particle, and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The result of a [[cross product]] is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so {{nowrap|'''F''' \u22a5 '''v'''}}. The [[dot product]] of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = '''F''' \u22c5 '''v''' = 0}}, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.\n\n==Mathematical calculation==\nFor moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or '''watts''') is the [[scalar product]] of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous [[power (physics)|power]]. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.<ref name=\"Resnick\">Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), ''Physics'', Section 1\u20133 (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527</ref>\n\nWork is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve '''X''', with a velocity '''v''', at each instant.  The small amount of work ''\u03b4W'' that occurs over an instant of time ''dt'' is calculated as\n:<math> \\delta W = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}dt </math>\nwhere the {{nowrap|'''F''' \u22c5 '''v'''}} is the power over the instant ''dt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot {\\tfrac{d\\mathbf{s}}{dt}}dt =\\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s},</math>\nwhere ''C'' is the trajectory from '''x'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to '''x'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>).  This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.\n\nIf the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is ''F'', then this integral simplifies to\n:<math>W = \\int_C F\\,ds</math>\nwhere ''s'' is displacement along the line. If '''F''' is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to\n:<math>W = \\int_C F\\,ds = F\\int_C ds = Fs</math>\nwhere ''s'' is the displacement of the point along the line.\n\nThis calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle.  In this case the [[dot product]] {{nowrap|1='''F''' \u22c5 ''d'''''s''' = ''F'' cos ''\u03b8'' ''ds''}}, where ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement,<ref name=\"Resnick\"/> that is\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = Fs\\cos\\theta.</math>\n\nIn the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90\u00b0 from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.\n\n=== Work done by a variable force ===\n\nCalculating the work as \"force times straight path segment\" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point [[velocity]] is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called ''scalar tangential component'' (<math>\\scriptstyle F\\cos\\theta</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle \\theta</math> is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:\n:''Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point.''\n:If the force varies (e.g. compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done.  If the force is given by F(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from <math>a</math> to <math>b</math> is:\n\n<math>W = \\int\\limits_{a}^{b} \\mathbf{F(s)} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}</math>\n\n===Torque and rotation===\nA [[Couple (mechanics)|force couple]] results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body.  The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque '''T'''.  The work of the torque is calculated as\n:<math> dW = \\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt,</math>\nwhere the {{nowrap|'''T''' \u22c5 '''\u03c9'''}} is the power over the instant ''\u03b4t''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt.</math>\nThis integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity \u03c9 that varies with time, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.\n\nIf the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,\n:<math> \\vec{\\omega}= \\dot{\\phi}\\mathbf{S},</math>\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector '''S'''.  In this case, the work of the torque becomes,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\mathbf{S}\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}dt = \\int_C\\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\mathbf{S} d\\phi,</math>\nwhere ''C'' is the trajectory from ''\u03c6''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to ''\u03c6''(''t''<sub>2</sub>).  This integral depends on the rotational trajectory ''\u03c6''(''t''), and is therefore path-dependent.\n\nIf the torque '''T''' is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,\n:<math> \\mathbf{T}=\\tau\\mathbf{S},</math>\nand both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,<ref name=\"Young\">{{cite book\n|author1=Hugh D.

This force will act through the distance along the circular arc {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''r\u03c6''}}, so the work done is\n:<math>W=Fs = Fr\\phi .</math>\nIntroduce the torque {{nowrap|1=''\u03c4'' = ''Fr''}}, to obtain\n:<math> W=Fr\\phi=\\tau\\phi,</math>\nas presented above.\n\nNotice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.\n\n==Work and potential energy==\nThe scalar product of a force '''F''' and the velocity '''v''' of its point of application defines the [[power (physics)|power]] input to a system at an instant of time.  Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, {{nowrap|1=''C'' = '''x'''(''t'')}}, defines the work input to the system by the force.\n\n===Path dependence===\nTherefore, the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt,</math>\nwhere ''dx''(''t'') defines the trajectory ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this trajectory.  In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.\n\nThe time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,\n:<math>\\frac{dW}{dt} = P(t) = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} .</math>\n\n===Path independence===\nIf the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force, by the [[gradient theorem]], defines a potential function which is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a potential function ''U''('''x'''), that can be evaluated at the two points '''x'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) and '''x'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} =  \\int_{\\mathbf{x}(t_1)}^{\\mathbf{x}(t_2)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} =  U(\\mathbf{x}(t_1))-U(\\mathbf{x}(t_2)).\n</math>\n\nThe function ''U''('''x''') is called the [[potential energy]] associated with the applied force.  The force derived from such a potential function is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.\n\nIn this case, the [[gradient]] of work yields\n:<math> \\nabla W =  -\\nabla U= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\mathbf{F},</math>\nand the force '''F''' is said to be \"derivable from a potential.\"<ref>J. R.

The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity '''V''' of the body, that is\n:<math>P(t) = -\\nabla U \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\n===Work by gravity===\n[[File:Work of gravity F dot d equals mgh.JPG|right|thumb|Gravity {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''mg''}} does work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mgh''}} along any descending path]]\nIn the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is {{nowrap|1=''g'' = 9.8&nbsp;m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>}} and the gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' is {{nowrap|1='''F'''<sub>g</sub> = ''mg''}}. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the [[center of mass]] of the object.\n\nIf an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance {{nowrap|''y''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''y''<sub>1</sub>}}, the work ''W'' done on the object by its weight mg is:\n:<math>W = F_g (y_2 - y_1) = F_g\\Delta y = - mg\\Delta y</math>\nwhere ''F<sub>g</sub>'' is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and \u0394''y'' is the change in height ''y''. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.\n\n===Work by gravity in space===\nThe force of gravity exerted by a mass ''M'' on another mass ''m'' is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r},</math>\nwhere '''r''' is the position vector from ''M'' to ''m''.\n\nLet the mass ''m'' move at the velocity '''v''' then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position '''r'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to  '''r'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) is given by\n:<math> W=-\\int^{\\mathbf{r}(t_2)}_{\\mathbf{r}(t_1)}\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r}\\cdot d\\mathbf{r}=-\\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}dt.</math>\nNotice that the position and velocity of the mass ''m'' are given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{r} = r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\qquad\\mathbf{v}=\\dot{r}\\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot{\\theta}\\mathbf{e}_t,</math>\nwhere '''e'''<sub>''r''</sub> and '''e'''<sub>''t''</sub> are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from ''M'' to ''m''.

Some authors call this result ''work\u2013energy principle'', but it is more widely known as '''the work\u2013energy theorem''':\n\n:<math>W = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt = m \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt = \\frac{m}{2} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{d v^2}{dt}\\,dt = \\frac{m}{2} \\int_{v^2_1}^{v^2_2} d v^2 = \\frac{mv_2^2}{2} - \\frac{mv_1^2}{2} = \\Delta {E_k} </math>\n\nThe identity <math>\\textstyle \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d v^2}{dt}</math> requires some algebra.\nFrom the identity <math>\\textstyle v^2 = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math> and definition <math>\\textstyle \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d \\mathbf{v}}{dt} </math>\nit follows\n:<math> \\frac{d v^2}{dt} = \\frac{d (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})}{dt} = \\frac{d \\mathbf{v}}{dt} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\frac{d \\mathbf{v}}{dt} = 2 \\frac{d \\mathbf{v}}{dt} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 2 \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>.\n\nThe remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case.\n\n===Derivation for a particle in constrained movement===\nIn particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]].  It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle.  Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work\u2013energy principle.\n\nTo see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') with a force '''F''' acting on it.  Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces '''R''', then Newton's Law takes the form\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}, </math>\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of the particle.\n\n====Vector formulation====\nNote that n dots above a vector indicates its nth [[time derivative]].\nThe [[scalar product]] of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} = m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}},</math>\nbecause the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity.  Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point '''X'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to the point '''X'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>)  to obtain\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} dt = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}dt. </math>\n\nThe left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time ''t''<sub>1</sub> to time ''t''<sub>2</sub>.  This can also be written as\n:<math> W = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} dt =    \\int_{\\mathbf{X}(t_1)}^{\\mathbf{X}(t_2)} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot d\\mathbf{X}.  </math>\nThis integral is computed along the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') of the particle and is therefore path dependent.\n\nThe right side of the first integral of Newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity\n:<math> \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}) = \\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}, </math>\n(see [[product rule]] for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy,\n:<math>\\Delta K = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}dt = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}) dt = \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}} (t_1) = \\frac{1}{2}m \\Delta \\mathbf{v^{2}} , </math>\nwhere the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,\n:<math> K = \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}} =\\frac{1}{2}m{\\mathbf{v^{2}}}</math>\n\n====Tangential and normal components====\nIt is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory '''X'''(''t''), such that\n:<math> \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}=v \\mathbf{T}\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}=\\dot{v}\\mathbf{T} + v^2\\kappa \\mathbf{N},</math>\nwhere\n:<math> v=|\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}|=\\sqrt{\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}}.</math>\nThen, the [[scalar product]] of velocity with acceleration in Newton's second law takes the form\n:<math> \\Delta K = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\dot{v}vdt = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\frac{d}{dt}v^2  dt = \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1),</math>\nwhere the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,\n:<math> K = \\frac{m}{2} v^2 = \\frac{m}{2} \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\n\nThe result is the work\u2013energy principle for particle dynamics,\n:<math> W = \\Delta K. \\!</math>\nThis derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.\n\n===Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)===\nConsider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to '''F'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define '''R''', and we have\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\nFor convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so {{nowrap|1='''X''' = (''d'', 0)}} and the velocity is {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v'', 0)}}, then {{nowrap|1='''R''' \u22c5 '''V''' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1='''F''' \u22c5 '''V''' = ''F''<sub>x</sub>''v''}}, where ''F''<sub>x</sub> is the component of '''F''' along the X-axis, so\n:<math> F_x v = m\\dot{v}v.</math>\nIntegration of both sides yields\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}F_x v dt =  \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). </math>\nIf F<sub>x</sub> is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so\n:<math> F_x (d(t_2)-d(t_1)) =  \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). </math>\n\nAs an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where ''k'' is the coefficient of friction and ''W'' is the weight of the car.  Then the force along the trajectory is {{nowrap|1=''F''<sub>x</sub> = \u2212''kW''}}.  The velocity ''v'' of the car can be determined from the length ''s'' of the skid using the work\u2013energy principle,\n:<math>kWs = \\frac{W}{2g} v^2,\\quad\\mbox{or}\\quad v = \\sqrt{2ksg}.</math>\nNotice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''W''/''g''}}.\n\n[[File:LotusType119B.jpg|thumb|Lotus type 119B gravity racer at Lotus 60th celebration.]]\n[[File:Campeonato de carrinhos de rolim\u00e3 em Campos Novos SC.jpg|thumb|Gravity racing championship in Campos Novos, Santa Catarina, Brazil, 8 September 2010.]]\n\n===Coasting down a mountain road (gravity racing)===\nConsider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity ''V'', of say 60&nbsp;mph (88 fps).  Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.\n\nLet the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be '''X'''(''t'') which is a curve in three-dimensional space.  The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (0, 0, ''W'')}}, while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force '''R'''.  Newton's second law yields,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\nThe [[scalar product]] of this equation with the velocity, {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v''<sub>x</sub>, ''v''<sub>y</sub>, ''v''<sub>z</sub>)}}, yields\n:<math> W v_z = m\\dot{V}V,</math>\nwhere ''V'' is the magnitude of '''V'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because {{nowrap|1='''R''' \u22c5 '''V''' = 0}}, which means they do no work.\nIntegrate both sides to obtain\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}W v_z dt =  \\frac{m}{2}V^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}V^2(t_1). </math>\nThe weight force ''W'' is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore,\n:<math> W \\Delta z =  \\frac{m}{2}V^2. </math>\nRecall that V(t<sub>1</sub>)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.\n\nIn order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road.  This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled\u2014for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal.  Therefore, the distance ''s'' in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity ''V'' is at least\n:<math> s=\\frac{\\Delta z}{0.06}= 8.3\\frac{V^2}{g},\\quad\\mbox{or}\\quad s=8.3\\frac{88^2}{32.2}\\approx 2000\\mbox{ft}.</math>\nThis formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}.\n\n==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==\nThe work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]].  To see this, let the forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub>, '''F'''<sub>2</sub> ... '''F'''<sub>n</sub> act on the points '''X'''<sub>1</sub>, '''X'''<sub>2</sub> ... '''X'''<sub>''n''</sub> in a rigid body.\n\nThe trajectories of '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  are defined by the movement of the rigid body.  This movement is given by the set of rotations [''A''(''t'')] and the trajectory '''d'''(''t'') of a reference point in the body.  Let the coordinates '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub> ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  define these points in the moving rigid body's  [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'', so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame ''F'' are given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{X}_i(t)= [A(t)]\\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{d}(t)\\quad i=1,\\ldots, n. </math>\n\nThe velocity of the points '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub> along their trajectories  are\n:<math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\vec{\\omega}\\times(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}) + \\dot{\\mathbf{d}},</math>\nwhere '''\u03c9''' is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix\n:<math> [\\Omega] = \\dot{A}A^\\mathrm{T},</math>\nknown as the angular velocity matrix.\n\nThe small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> can be determined by approximating the displacement by {{nowrap|1=''\u03b4'''''r''' = '''v'''''\u03b4t''}} so\n:<math> \\delta W = \\mathbf{F}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_1\\delta t+\\mathbf{F}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_2\\delta t + \\ldots + \\mathbf{F}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_n\\delta t</math>\nor\n:<math> \\delta W =  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{F}_i\\cdot (\\vec{\\omega}\\times(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}) + \\dot{\\mathbf{d}})\\delta t. </math>\n\nThis formula can be rewritten to obtain\n:<math> \\delta W =  \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{F}_i\\right)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{d}}\\delta t + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}\\right)\\times\\mathbf{F}_i\\right) \\cdot \\vec{\\omega}\\delta t = \\left(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{d}}+ \\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\vec{\\omega}\\right)\\delta t, </math>\nwhere '''F''' and '''T''' are the [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]] applied at the reference point '''d''' of the moving frame ''M'' in the rigid body.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book | author1=Serway, Raymond A. | author2=Jewett, John W. | title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers | edition=6th | publisher=Brooks/Cole | year=2004 | isbn=0-534-40842-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/physicssciengv2p00serw }}\n* {{cite book | author=Tipler, Paul | title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Mechanics| edition=3rd ed., extended version | publisher=W.

Due to work having the same [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] as [[heat]], occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as [[therm]], [[BTU]] and [[Calorie]], are utilized as a measuring unit.\n\n==Work and energy==\nThe work <math>W</math> done by a constant force of magnitude <math>F</math> on a point that moves a displacement <math>s</math> in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product\n:<math>W = F s</math>.\n\nFor example, if a force of 10 newtons (<math>F</math> = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres (<math>s</math> = 2 m), then <math>W = F s = (10\\ \\mathrm N)(2\\ \\mathrm m) = 20\\ \\mathrm J.</math> This is approximately the work done lifting a 1&nbsp;kg object from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravity.\n\nThe work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.\n\nWork is closely related to [[energy]]. The work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force.\n\nFrom [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy <math>KE</math> of the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body,\n:<math>W = \\Delta KE.</math>\nThe work of forces generated by a potential function is known as [[potential energy]] and the forces are said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force [[Field (physics)|field]], without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to ''minus'' the change of potential energy <math>PE</math> of the object,\n:<math>W = -\\Delta PE.</math>\nThese formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]], and units, of energy.\nThe work/energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work/energy principles.\n\n==Constraint forces==\nConstraint forces limit the movement of components in a system, such as constraining an object to a surface (in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is ''stuck to'' the slope, when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter').  Constraint forces restrict the velocity in the direction of the constraint to zero, which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.\n\nFor a [[Virtual work|mechanical system]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Goldstein, Classical Mechanics, third edition. P.19</ref> constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraint. Thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, because the component of velocity along the constraint force at each point of application is zero. For example, in a pulley system like the [[Atwood machine]], the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system. Therefore work need only be computed for the gravity forces acting on the bodies.\n\nFor example, the [[centripetal force]] exerted ''inwards'' by a string on a ball in uniform [[circular motion]] ''sideways'' constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle.  This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.\n\nAnother example is a book on a table.   If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table, then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards.  The force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work.\n\nThe [[magnetic force]] on a charged particle is {{nowrap|1='''F''' = ''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}, where ''q'' is the charge, '''v''' is the velocity of the particle, and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The result of a [[cross product]] is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so {{nowrap|'''F''' \u22a5 '''v'''}}. The [[dot product]] of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = '''F''' \u22c5 '''v''' = 0}}, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.\n\n==Mathematical calculation==\nFor moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or '''watts''') is the [[scalar product]] of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous [[power (physics)|power]]. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.<ref name=\"Resnick\">Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), ''Physics'', Section 1\u20133 (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527</ref>\n\nWork is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve '''X''', with a velocity '''v''', at each instant.  The small amount of work ''\u03b4W'' that occurs over an instant of time ''dt'' is calculated as\n:<math> \\delta W = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}dt </math>\nwhere the {{nowrap|'''F''' \u22c5 '''v'''}} is the power over the instant ''dt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot {\\tfrac{d\\mathbf{s}}{dt}}dt =\\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s},</math>\nwhere ''C'' is the trajectory from '''x'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to '''x'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>).  This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.\n\nIf the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is ''F'', then this integral simplifies to\n:<math>W = \\int_C F\\,ds</math>\nwhere ''s'' is displacement along the line. If '''F''' is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to\n:<math>W = \\int_C F\\,ds = F\\int_C ds = Fs</math>\nwhere ''s'' is the displacement of the point along the line.\n\nThis calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle.  In this case the [[dot product]] {{nowrap|1='''F''' \u22c5 ''d'''''s''' = ''F'' cos ''\u03b8'' ''ds''}}, where ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement,<ref name=\"Resnick\"/> that is\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = Fs\\cos\\theta.</math>\n\nIn the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90\u00b0 from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.\n\n=== Work done by a variable force ===\n\nCalculating the work as \"force times straight path segment\" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point [[velocity]] is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called ''scalar tangential component'' (<math>\\scriptstyle F\\cos\\theta</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle \\theta</math> is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:\n:''Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point.''\n:If the force varies (e.g. compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done.  If the force is given by F(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from <math>a</math> to <math>b</math> is:\n\n<math>W = \\int\\limits_{a}^{b} \\mathbf{F(s)} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}</math>\n\n===Torque and rotation===\nA [[Couple (mechanics)|force couple]] results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body.  The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque '''T'''.  The work of the torque is calculated as\n:<math> dW = \\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt,</math>\nwhere the {{nowrap|'''T''' \u22c5 '''\u03c9'''}} is the power over the instant ''\u03b4t''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt.</math>\nThis integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity \u03c9 that varies with time, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.\n\nIf the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,\n:<math> \\vec{\\omega}= \\dot{\\phi}\\mathbf{S},</math>\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector '''S'''.  In this case, the work of the torque becomes,\n:<math>W =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega}dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\mathbf{S}\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}dt = \\int_C\\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\mathbf{S} d\\phi,</math>\nwhere ''C'' is the trajectory from ''\u03c6''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to ''\u03c6''(''t''<sub>2</sub>).  This integral depends on the rotational trajectory ''\u03c6''(''t''), and is therefore path-dependent.\n\nIf the torque '''T''' is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,\n:<math> \\mathbf{T}=\\tau\\mathbf{S},</math>\nand both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,<ref name=\"Young\">{{cite book\n|author1=Hugh D.

This force will act through the distance along the circular arc {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''r\u03c6''}}, so the work done is\n:<math>W=Fs = Fr\\phi .</math>\nIntroduce the torque {{nowrap|1=''\u03c4'' = ''Fr''}}, to obtain\n:<math> W=Fr\\phi=\\tau\\phi,</math>\nas presented above.\n\nNotice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.\n\n==Work and potential energy==\nThe scalar product of a force '''F''' and the velocity '''v''' of its point of application defines the [[power (physics)|power]] input to a system at an instant of time.  Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, {{nowrap|1=''C'' = '''x'''(''t'')}}, defines the work input to the system by the force.\n\n===Path dependence===\nTherefore, the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} =  \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\mathbf{F}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}dt,</math>\nwhere ''dx''(''t'') defines the trajectory ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this trajectory.  In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.\n\nThe time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,\n:<math>\\frac{dW}{dt} = P(t) = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} .</math>\n\n===Path independence===\nIf the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force, by the [[gradient theorem]], defines a potential function which is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a potential function ''U''('''x'''), that can be evaluated at the two points '''x'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) and '''x'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} =  \\int_{\\mathbf{x}(t_1)}^{\\mathbf{x}(t_2)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} =  U(\\mathbf{x}(t_1))-U(\\mathbf{x}(t_2)).\n</math>\n\nThe function ''U''('''x''') is called the [[potential energy]] associated with the applied force.  The force derived from such a potential function is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.\n\nIn this case, the [[gradient]] of work yields\n:<math> \\nabla W =  -\\nabla U= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\mathbf{F},</math>\nand the force '''F''' is said to be \"derivable from a potential.\"<ref>J.

The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity '''V''' of the body, that is\n:<math>P(t) = -\\nabla U \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\n===Work by gravity===\n[[File:Work of gravity F dot d equals mgh.JPG|right|thumb|Gravity {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''mg''}} does work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mgh''}} along any descending path]]\nIn the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is {{nowrap|1=''g'' = 9.8&nbsp;m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>}} and the gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' is {{nowrap|1='''F'''<sub>g</sub> = ''mg''}}. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the [[center of mass]] of the object.\n\nIf an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance {{nowrap|''y''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''y''<sub>1</sub>}}, the work ''W'' done on the object by its weight mg is:\n:<math>W = F_g (y_2 - y_1) = F_g\\Delta y = - mg\\Delta y</math>\nwhere ''F<sub>g</sub>'' is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and \u0394''y'' is the change in height ''y''. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.\n\n===Work by gravity in space===\nThe force of gravity exerted by a mass ''M'' on another mass ''m'' is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r},</math>\nwhere '''r''' is the position vector from ''M'' to ''m''.\n\nLet the mass ''m'' move at the velocity '''v''' then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position '''r'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to  '''r'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) is given by\n:<math> W=-\\int^{\\mathbf{r}(t_2)}_{\\mathbf{r}(t_1)}\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r}\\cdot d\\mathbf{r}=-\\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\\frac{GMm}{r^3}\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}dt.</math>\nNotice that the position and velocity of the mass ''m'' are given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{r} = r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\qquad\\mathbf{v}=\\dot{r}\\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot{\\theta}\\mathbf{e}_t,</math>\nwhere '''e'''<sub>''r''</sub> and '''e'''<sub>''t''</sub> are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from ''M'' to ''m''.

The work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve {{nowrap|1='''X'''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), ''z''(''t''))}}, is calculated using its velocity, {{nowrap|1='''v''' = (''v''<sub>x</sub>, ''v''<sub>y</sub>, ''v''<sub>z</sub>)}}, to obtain\n:<math>W=\\int_0^t\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}dt =-\\int_0^tkx v_x dt = -\\frac{1}{2}kx^2. </math>\nFor convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}, then the integral of the product of the distance ''x'' and the x-velocity, ''xv''<sub>x</sub>, is (1/2)''x''<sup>2</sup>.\nThe velocity is not a factor here.

It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle.  Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work\u2013energy principle.\n\nTo see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') with a force '''F''' acting on it.  Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces '''R''', then Newton's Law takes the form\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}, </math>\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of the particle.\n\n====Vector formulation====\nNote that n dots above a vector indicates its nth [[time derivative]].\nThe [[scalar product]] of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} = m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}},</math>\nbecause the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity.  Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point '''X'''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) to the point '''X'''(''t''<sub>2</sub>)  to obtain\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} dt = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}dt. </math>\n\nThe left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time ''t''<sub>1</sub> to time ''t''<sub>2</sub>.  This can also be written as\n:<math> W = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}} dt =    \\int_{\\mathbf{X}(t_1)}^{\\mathbf{X}(t_2)} \\mathbf{F}\\cdot d\\mathbf{X}.  </math>\nThis integral is computed along the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') of the particle and is therefore path dependent.\n\nThe right side of the first integral of Newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity\n:<math> \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}) = \\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}, </math>\n(see [[product rule]] for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy,\n:<math>\\Delta K = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}dt = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}) dt = \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}} (t_1) = \\frac{1}{2}m \\Delta \\mathbf{v^{2}} , </math>\nwhere the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,\n:<math> K = \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{X}} =\\frac{1}{2}m{\\mathbf{v^{2}}}</math>\n\n====Tangential and normal components====\nIt is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory '''X'''(''t''), such that\n:<math> \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}=v \\mathbf{T}\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}=\\dot{v}\\mathbf{T} + v^2\\kappa \\mathbf{N},</math>\nwhere\n:<math> v=|\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}|=\\sqrt{\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}}.</math>\nThen, the [[scalar product]] of velocity with acceleration in Newton's second law takes the form\n:<math> \\Delta K = m\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\dot{v}vdt = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\frac{d}{dt}v^2  dt = \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1),</math>\nwhere the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,\n:<math> K = \\frac{m}{2} v^2 = \\frac{m}{2} \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\n\nThe result is the work\u2013energy principle for particle dynamics,\n:<math> W = \\Delta K. \\!</math>\nThis derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.\n\n===Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)===\nConsider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to '''F'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define '''R''', and we have\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\nFor convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so {{nowrap|1='''X''' = (''d'', 0)}} and the velocity is {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v'', 0)}}, then {{nowrap|1='''R''' \u22c5 '''V''' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1='''F''' \u22c5 '''V''' = ''F''<sub>x</sub>''v''}}, where ''F''<sub>x</sub> is the component of '''F''' along the X-axis, so\n:<math> F_x v = m\\dot{v}v.</math>\nIntegration of both sides yields\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}F_x v dt =  \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). </math>\nIf F<sub>x</sub> is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so\n:<math> F_x (d(t_2)-d(t_1)) =  \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). </math>\n\nAs an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where ''k'' is the coefficient of friction and ''W'' is the weight of the car.  Then the force along the trajectory is {{nowrap|1=''F''<sub>x</sub> = \u2212''kW''}}.  The velocity ''v'' of the car can be determined from the length ''s'' of the skid using the work\u2013energy principle,\n:<math>kWs = \\frac{W}{2g} v^2,\\quad\\mbox{or}\\quad v = \\sqrt{2ksg}.</math>\nNotice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''W''/''g''}}.\n\n[[File:LotusType119B.jpg|thumb|Lotus type 119B gravity racer at Lotus 60th celebration.]]\n[[File:Campeonato de carrinhos de rolim\u00e3 em Campos Novos SC.jpg|thumb|Gravity racing championship in Campos Novos, Santa Catarina, Brazil, 8 September 2010.]]\n\n===Coasting down a mountain road (gravity racing)===\nConsider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity ''V'', of say 60&nbsp;mph (88 fps).  Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.\n\nLet the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be '''X'''(''t'') which is a curve in three-dimensional space.  The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (0, 0, ''W'')}}, while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force '''R'''.  Newton's second law yields,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{R} =m\\ddot{\\mathbf{X}}. </math>\nThe [[scalar product]] of this equation with the velocity, {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v''<sub>x</sub>, ''v''<sub>y</sub>, ''v''<sub>z</sub>)}}, yields\n:<math> W v_z = m\\dot{V}V,</math>\nwhere ''V'' is the magnitude of '''V'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because {{nowrap|1='''R''' \u22c5 '''V''' = 0}}, which means they do no work.\nIntegrate both sides to obtain\n:<math> \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}W v_z dt =  \\frac{m}{2}V^2(t_2) - \\frac{m}{2}V^2(t_1). </math>\nThe weight force ''W'' is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore,\n:<math> W \\Delta z =  \\frac{m}{2}V^2. </math>\nRecall that V(t<sub>1</sub>)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.\n\nIn order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road.  This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled\u2014for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal.  Therefore, the distance ''s'' in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity ''V'' is at least\n:<math> s=\\frac{\\Delta z}{0.06}= 8.3\\frac{V^2}{g},\\quad\\mbox{or}\\quad s=8.3\\frac{88^2}{32.2}\\approx 2000\\mbox{ft}.</math>\nThis formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}.\n\n==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==\nThe work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]].  To see this, let the forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub>, '''F'''<sub>2</sub> ... '''F'''<sub>n</sub> act on the points '''X'''<sub>1</sub>, '''X'''<sub>2</sub> ... '''X'''<sub>''n''</sub> in a rigid body.\n\nThe trajectories of '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  are defined by the movement of the rigid body.  This movement is given by the set of rotations [''A''(''t'')] and the trajectory '''d'''(''t'') of a reference point in the body.  Let the coordinates '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub> ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  define these points in the moving rigid body's  [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'', so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame ''F'' are given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{X}_i(t)= [A(t)]\\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{d}(t)\\quad i=1,\\ldots, n. </math>\n\nThe velocity of the points '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub> along their trajectories  are\n:<math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\vec{\\omega}\\times(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}) + \\dot{\\mathbf{d}},</math>\nwhere '''\u03c9''' is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix\n:<math> [\\Omega] = \\dot{A}A^\\mathrm{T},</math>\nknown as the angular velocity matrix.\n\nThe small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> can be determined by approximating the displacement by {{nowrap|1=''\u03b4'''''r''' = '''v'''''\u03b4t''}} so\n:<math> \\delta W = \\mathbf{F}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_1\\delta t+\\mathbf{F}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_2\\delta t + \\ldots + \\mathbf{F}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{V}_n\\delta t</math>\nor\n:<math> \\delta W =  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{F}_i\\cdot (\\vec{\\omega}\\times(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}) + \\dot{\\mathbf{d}})\\delta t. </math>\n\nThis formula can be rewritten to obtain\n:<math> \\delta W =  \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{F}_i\\right)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{d}}\\delta t + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\mathbf{d}\\right)\\times\\mathbf{F}_i\\right) \\cdot \\vec{\\omega}\\delta t = \\left(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{d}}+ \\mathbf{T}\\cdot \\vec{\\omega}\\right)\\delta t, </math>\nwhere '''F''' and '''T''' are the [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]] applied at the reference point '''d''' of the moving frame ''M'' in the rigid body.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book | author1=Serway, Raymond A. | author2=Jewett, John W. | title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers | edition=6th | publisher=Brooks/Cole | year=2004 | isbn=0-534-40842-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/physicssciengv2p00serw }}\n* {{cite book | author=Tipler, Paul | title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Mechanics| edition=3rd ed., extended version | publisher=W.

During [[World War II]], the name of the EPS was changed to Civil Defence. While EPS/Civil Defence did not need to respond to any invasion attempts, it was twice called upon to assist with earthquake recovery efforts in [[Wellington]] and the [[Wairarapa]] region in 1942.\n\nFollowing the war, responsibility for civil defence was assumed by the Department of Internal Affairs. A ''Review of Defence'' [[white paper]], issued by the [[Second Labour Government]] amid the fear of nuclear war, proposed the establishment of a separate Ministry of Civil Defence. The first Director of Civil Defence was J.V. Meech (also the Secretary of Internal Affairs), though in practice much of the work was delegated to Andrew Sharp; the first Minister of Civil Defence in the post-war period was [[Bill Anderton]] (also the Minister of Internal Affairs). The Civil Defence Act 1962 set out in legislation the responsibilities and duties of the Ministry. In 1964, the first full-time Director of Civil Defence was appointed: Brigadier R.C.

During [[World War II]], the name of the EPS was changed to Civil Defence. While EPS/Civil Defence did not need to respond to any invasion attempts, it was twice called upon to assist with earthquake recovery efforts in [[Wellington]] and the [[Wairarapa]] region in 1942.\n\nFollowing the war, responsibility for civil defence was assumed by the Department of Internal Affairs. A ''Review of Defence'' [[white paper]], issued by the [[Second Labour Government]] amid the fear of nuclear war, proposed the establishment of a separate Ministry of Civil Defence. The first Director of Civil Defence was J.V. Meech (also the Secretary of Internal Affairs), though in practice much of the work was delegated to Andrew Sharp; the first Minister of Civil Defence in the post-war period was [[Bill Anderton]] (also the Minister of Internal Affairs). The Civil Defence Act 1962 set out in legislation the responsibilities and duties of the Ministry. In 1964, the first full-time Director of Civil Defence was appointed: Brigadier R.C. Queree.\n\nA new Ministry for Emergency Management was established under the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand#The National-New Zealand First Coalition|National/New Zealand First Coalition Government]] by Civil Defence Minister [[Jack Elder]] on 1 July 1999, following the Review of Emergency Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adpc.net/v2007/IKM/ONLINE%20DOCUMENTS/downloads/ADUMP/PLI.pdf|title=Policy, Legal and Institutional Arrangements|author=Shirley Mattingly|date=2007|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-moves-protect-communities|title=New moves to protect communities|date=5 August 1999|accessdate=19 September 2017|author=Jack Elder}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2003/estimates/est03emerg.pdf|title=Vote Emergency Management|date=2003|accessdate=19 September 2017|page=516}}</ref> This replaced the existing Ministry of Civil Defence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL9910/S00033/house-valedictory-of-hon-jack-elder.htm|title=Valedictory statement of Hon Jack Elder|date=7 October 1999|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> Later, the department name changed again to become the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, its current title.\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management moved from the Department of Internal Affairs to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet on 1 April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/civil-defence-moves-department-prime-minister-and-cabinet|title=Civil defence moves to Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet|author=Nikki Kaye|publisher=Beehive.govt.nz|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> This was intended to reflect DMPC's role as the government's lead agency in national security planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/mcdem-shift-will-strengthen-emergency-management-and-resilience|title=MCDEM shift will strengthen emergency management and resilience|author1=Jonathan Coleman|author2=Nikki Kaye|date=19 November 2013|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nThe Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management administers the [[Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002]] and:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/about/about-the-ministry/|title=About the Ministry|publisher=Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management|accessdate=19 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615104010/http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/about/about-the-ministry/|archive-date=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n* provides advice to government on civil defence emergency management matters\n* identifies hazards and risks\n* develops, maintains and evaluates the effectiveness of the civil defence emergency management strategic framework\n* ensures coordination at local, regional, and national levels\n* promotes civil defence emergency management and deliver public awareness about how to prepare for, and what to do in, an emergency\n* supports civil defence emergency management sector capability development, planning and operations, including developing guidelines and standards\n* monitors and evaluates the performance of the 16 regional Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups\n* maintains and operates the National Crisis Management Centre, including the maintenance of a duty team to staff the Centre, and issue warnings and public information\n* manages the central government response to, and recovery from, large scale emergencies resulting from geological (earthquakes, volcanic unrest, landslides, tsunami), meteorological (coastal hazards, floods, severe winds, snow) and infrastructure failure.\n\n==List of Ministers of Civil Defence==\n;Key\n{{legend2|{{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|[[New Zealand National Party|National]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|[[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{New Zealand First/meta/color}}|[[New Zealand First|NZ First]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Mauri Pacific/meta/color}}|[[Mauri Pacific]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|No.\n!
