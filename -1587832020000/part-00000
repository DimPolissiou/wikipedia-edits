In 2016, WWE reintroduced its brand split and the championship became exclusive to Raw. It was subsequently renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship after SmackDown introduced its [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[No Mercy (2002)|No Mercy]] on October 20, 2002. The current champions are [[The Street Profits]] ([[Angelo Dawkins]] and [[Montez Ford]]), who are in their first reign both as a team and individually. They defeated [[Seth Rollins]] and [[Buddy Murphy|Murphy]] in a [[Last Chance match]] on the March 2, 2020 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 79 reigns between 62 teams composed of 90 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Cesaro and Sheamus]] have the most reigns at 4, while individually, [[Seth Rollins]] has the most reigns at six. [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]], [[Kofi Kingston]], and [[Xavier Woods]]) have the longest reign at 483 days and are also the only team to hold the championship for over one consecutive year, while [[John Cena]] and [[The Miz]] have the shortest reign as a team at 9 minutes, due to [[The Corre]] invoking their rematch clause immediately after losing the title. As a team, The New Day also have the longest combined reign at 532 days, while Kingston individually has the longest combined reign at 817 days (533 and 818 days, respectively, as recognized by WWE). [[John Cone#Personal life|Nicholas]] is the youngest champion with this title and in WWE history at 10 years old, while [[Billy Gunn]] is the oldest champion at age 50.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Tag Team Championship\n|October 20, 2002 \u2013 April 5, 2009\n|- \n|Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\n|April 5, 2009 \u2013 August 16, 2010\n|-\n|WWE Tag Team Championship\n|August 16, 2010 \u2013 September 5, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Tag Team Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Reigns === <!-- DO NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

brand)|Raw]] brand. Introduced as the WWE Tag Team Championship, it was WWE's third world tag team title, and sixth tag team title overall. After WWE bought the [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), and unified the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW Tag Team Championship]] into its own title at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series 2001]], it [[WWE brand extension|split its roster into two brands]], Raw and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. As WWE's [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|original World Tag Team Championship]] was designated exclusive to the Raw brand, SmackDown introduced the WWE Tag Team Championship as its own championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408044957/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 8, 2005 |title=WWE Entertainment, Inc.

In 2016, WWE reintroduced its brand split and the championship became exclusive to Raw. It was subsequently renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship after SmackDown introduced its [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[No Mercy (2002)|No Mercy]] on October 20, 2002. The current champions are [[The Street Profits]] ([[Angelo Dawkins]] and [[Montez Ford]]), who are in their first reign both as a team and individually. They defeated [[Seth Rollins]] and [[Buddy Murphy|Murphy]] in a [[Last Chance match]] on the March 2, 2020 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 79 reigns between 62 teams composed of 90 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Cesaro and Sheamus]] have the most reigns at 4, while individually, [[Seth Rollins]] has the most reigns at six. [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]], [[Kofi Kingston]], and [[Xavier Woods]]) have the longest reign at 483 days and are also the only team to hold the championship for over one consecutive year, while [[John Cena]] and [[The Miz]] have the shortest reign as a team at 9 minutes, due to [[The Corre]] invoking their rematch clause immediately after losing the title. As a team, The New Day also have the longest combined reign at 532 days, while Kingston individually has the longest combined reign at 817 days (533 and 818 days, respectively, as recognized by WWE). [[John Cone#Personal life|Nicholas]] is the youngest champion with this title and in WWE history at 10 years old, while [[Billy Gunn]] is the oldest champion at age 50.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Tag Team Championship\n|October 20, 2002 \u2013 April 5, 2009\n|- \n|Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\n|April 5, 2009 \u2013 August 16, 2010\n|-\n|WWE Tag Team Championship\n|August 16, 2010 \u2013 September 5, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Tag Team Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Reigns === <!-- DO NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

I never got around to it.\"<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> At the age of eighteen, he obtained his [[General Educational Development|GED]] and briefly married a woman he met after she called him on-air to request ''[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]'', a song by [[Leonard Cohen]] which told a tale of a troubled relationship. Dahl later explained his short-lived marriage by commenting, \"I should have paid more attention to that song.\"<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDahl was told by radio executives that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit for about six months and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making [[mix tape]]s of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nIn 1976, Dahl's ex-wife told him about an opening for a morning show in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on [[WYCD|WABX]]. He managed to secure the job, despite the fact that he did not think he was good enough for it<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> (he later learned that the station was owned by the same company his ex-wife worked for). At WABX, Dahl learned as much as he could about what constituted \"good radio\" and also began experimenting with his content. His popularity increased to the point that he achieved a [[Media market|7.2 market share]].<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDuring his time at WABX, Dahl was introduced to Janet Joliat, a [[junior high school]] English and drama teacher in a Detroit suburb, who was casually dating a friend of his and was also a listener of his show. The two hit it off after Dahl invited her to a \"[[hump day]]\" broadcast he was doing from the camel area of the [[Detroit Zoo]].<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nWDAI executives in Chicago, attracted by Dahl's 7.1 share, approached him and offered to double his salary to $50,000 a year.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}  However, Janet did not want to leave her family in Detroit and he did not want to leave her. This prompted Dahl to ask his bosses for $35,000 a year to stay in Detroit, which they refused.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}  In 1978, after Janet accepted his marriage proposal, Dahl left Detroit for WDAI in Chicago.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== ''Rude Awakening'' ===\nDahl began at WDAI Chicago on February 23, 1978 with his solo ''Steve Dahl's Rude Awakening'' show,<ref name=\"CST121089\" /> but it never achieved solid ratings despite media attention. Ten months later, on Christmas Eve, 1978, WDAI changed formats from rock to disco and fired Dahl.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\n=== {{anchor|Steve and Garry}}''Steve & Garry'' ===\n<!-- The articles [[Garry Meier]], [[Kevin Matthews (radio personality)]] and [[Christina Filiaggi]] all link to this section; Please do not change section name before discussing on [[Talk:Steve Dahl]]-->\nIn March 1979, after a few months without a job, Dahl was hired to do a morning show at WLUP where he met overnight DJ [[Garry Meier]] (who was then broadcasting under the [[pseudonym]] of \"Matthew Meier\"). Shortly thereafter, the two began a cross talk that eventually led to Meier being teamed up with Dahl as both [[sidekick]] and newsman.<ref name=\"CST121089\" /><ref name=\"CT110694\" />  Dahl effectively forced Meier to use his actual name by calling him \"Garry\" on-air accidentally. After openly discussing the subject, again, on-air, Meier officially dropped his pseudonym.\n\n==== Disco Demolition Night ====\n{{Main|Disco Demolition Night}}\nIn response to Dahl's firing from WDAI, Dahl and Meier mocked and heaped scorn on disco records and WDAI (calling it \"Disco-D.I.E.\" mocking the station's slogan, \"Disco-D.A.I.\") on the air. Dahl even recorded and started playing a parody of [[Rod Stewart]]'s \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]\", which he called \"Do You Think I'm Disco?\". The song managed to crack the national charts to peak at No. 58 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|Hot 100]] and received airplay across the country.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDuring this same time period, Dahl and Meier, along with Mike Veeck (son of then [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Bill Veeck]]), Jeff Schwartz of WLUP Sales and Dave Logan, the WLUP Promotions Director, came up with a radio promotion and tie-in to the White Sox called Disco Demolition Night which took place on Thursday, July 12, 1979. The concept was to create an event to \"end disco once and for all\" in the [[Baseball field#outfield|center field]] of [[Comiskey Park]] that night by allowing people to get tickets at the box office if they brought $0.98 (for WLUP's frequency) and at least one disco record.<ref name=\"sw010\">{{cite news|first=Macaulay|last=Campbell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/16/business/media-shock-waves.html|title=Media; Shock Waves|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2002-09-16|accessdate=2014-12-25}}</ref> More than 50,000 fans showed up, the records were collected, piled up on the field and blown up. As the second game of the [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] was about to begin, the raucous crowd [[Pitch invasion|stormed onto the field]], refused to leave, and proceeded by setting [[Bonfire|fires]], tearing out seats and pieces of turf, and other damage. [[American League]] President [[Lee MacPhail]] later declared the second game of the doubleheader a [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] victory for the visiting [[Detroit Tigers]]. Six people reported minor injuries, and thirty-nine were arrested for [[disorderly conduct]].<ref name=\"1979xxx\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E6D9113AE23BA15750C1A9619C946890D6CF|title=Anti-Disco Rally Halts White Sox|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=A16|date=1979-07-13|accessdate=2014-10-24|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==== Height of collaboration ====\nAs a result of Disco Demolition Night, Dahl attained national recognition and his popularity increased significantly. He established a [[Syndicate#Media|syndicate]] and the ''Steve & Garry'' show began airing in Detroit and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], where it performed well. However, in February 1981, WLUP fired Dahl, citing \"continued assaults on community standards\". \"It was going on in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me,\" Dahl later said.<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> Meier was offered the opportunity to continue the show by himself, but he refused.<ref name=\"CST121089\" />{{rquote|right|I always used to get ticked off when I would get lumped in with Howard Stern as being a [[shock jock]].

He also made on-the-air [[Prank call|prank phone calls]] to the \"Islamic Fried Chicken\" (a play on [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]), ordering buckets of chicken for the hostages in the US [[embassy]], for which the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] later reprimanded him.<ref name=\"CT070403\">{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-07-04/features/0307040100_1_steve-dahl-garry-meier-dahl-and-meier|title=You call that service?|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2003-07-04|accessdate=2014-12-25}}</ref> Dahl also parodied the [[John Wayne Gacy]] murders with his song \"Another Kid in the Crawl\" (to the tune of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Another Brick in the Wall]]\"). The playing of the song was stopped after parents of the murdered children called to complain.<ref name=\"DahlLeaves\" />\n\nDahl and Meier won a [[Emmy Award#Regional Emmys|local Emmy award]]<ref name=\"CST121089-2\" /> for a television special they did in 1981 called, ''Greetings from [[Graceland]]'', which was a comedy spoof on the tourist shrine<ref name=\"WSJ052595\">{{cite news|title=Roach Clips|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|page=Rhythm, 3|date=1995-05-25}}</ref> and featured [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] \"Uncle Vester\" selling Elvis cookbooks from the guardhouse.<ref name=\"CST121089\" />  They briefly had a morning television show, called ''It's Too Early'' on local Chicago station, [[WGBO-TV|WFBN-TV]], which nationally syndicated columnist [[Bob Greene]] called \"the best program on television\", \"amazing\", and \"hypnotic\" in his June 20, 1983 column.

Colford, a former writer for [[Long Island Newsday]], [[Howard Stern]] listened to tapes of Steve and Garry sent from Chicago by a friend of the chief engineer at WCCC Hartford. Colford claims Stern eventually developed his on-air style as a result of these tapes. Later, Stern was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).<ref name=\"col001\" />\n\n==== End of collaboration ====\n''Steve & Garry'' moved to WLS, but ultimately returned to WLUP where they stayed until their split in 1993. The alleged reason for the break-up was Dahl's on-the-air comments about Meier's new wife, commercial real-estate broker Cynthia Fircak, while the new couple were on their [[honeymoon]].<ref name=\"CT110694\"/> Meier also blamed Dahl's [[alcoholism]] and unpredictable behavior. Dahl, for his part, blamed Fircak for the split, once saying on air \"When I met her, I knew the rules had just changed.\"\n\nIn 2003, [[Robert Feder]], a [[columnist]] for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', said, \"It's the divorce that just keeps on giving: A decade after Steve Dahl and Garry Meier severed their legendary radio partnership, their breakup remains a source of bitterness and anger for them \u2014 and continuing fascination for their fans.\"<ref name=\"st002\">{{cite news|last=Feder|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Feder|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1485752.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170651/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1485752.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-03-07|title=Meier blasts 'delusional' Dahl over radio breakup.|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2003-06-03|accessdate=2014-10-24|url-access=subscription |via=[[Highbeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter the team broke up, Dahl went to [[Sports radio|Sports Talk]] WMVP AM and teamed with Chicago [[sportscaster]] [[Bruce Wolf]].<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\n=== WCKG years ===\nDahl ended up on WCKG, broadcasting an afternoon show on that station.<ref name=\"knopper010\">{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Knopper|title='Subtler' Steve Dahl still rocks Chicago|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=68|date=1998-03-07}}</ref> He eventually teamed up with Buzz Kilman, who was Dahl's newsman starting in 1980 on WLUP, and the show was available as a [[podcast]] at Dahl's [[website]] and streamed live on WCKG's website.

I never got around to it.\"<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> At the age of eighteen, he obtained his [[General Educational Development|GED]] and briefly married a woman he met after she called him on-air to request ''[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]'', a song by [[Leonard Cohen]] which told a tale of a troubled relationship. Dahl later explained his short-lived marriage by commenting, \"I should have paid more attention to that song.\"<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDahl was told by radio executives that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit for about six months and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making [[mix tape]]s of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nIn 1976, Dahl's ex-wife told him about an opening for a morning show in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on [[WYCD|WABX]]. He managed to secure the job, despite the fact that he did not think he was good enough for it<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> (he later learned that the station was owned by the same company his ex-wife worked for). At WABX, Dahl learned as much as he could about what constituted \"good radio\" and also began experimenting with his content. His popularity increased to the point that he achieved a [[Media market|7.2 market share]].<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDuring his time at WABX, Dahl was introduced to Janet Joliat, a [[junior high school]] English and drama teacher in a Detroit suburb, who was casually dating a friend of his and was also a listener of his show. The two hit it off after Dahl invited her to a \"[[hump day]]\" broadcast he was doing from the camel area of the [[Detroit Zoo]].<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nWDAI executives in Chicago, attracted by Dahl's 7.1 share, approached him and offered to double his salary to $50,000 a year.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}  However, Janet did not want to leave her family in Detroit and he did not want to leave her. This prompted Dahl to ask his bosses for $35,000 a year to stay in Detroit, which they refused.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}  In 1978, after Janet accepted his marriage proposal, Dahl left Detroit for WDAI in Chicago.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />{{failed verification|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Rude Awakening ===\nDahl began at WDAI Chicago on February 23, 1978 with his solo \"Steve Dahl's Rude Awakening\" show,<ref name=\"CST121089\" /> but it never achieved solid ratings despite media attention. Ten months later, on Christmas Eve, 1978, WDAI changed formats from rock to disco and fired Dahl.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\n=== {{anchor|Steve and Garry}}''Steve & Garry'' ===\n<!-- The articles [[Garry Meier]], [[Kevin Matthews (radio personality)]] and [[Christina Filiaggi]] all link to this section; Please do not change section name before discussing on [[Talk:Steve Dahl]]-->\nIn March 1979, after a few months without a job, Dahl was hired to do a morning show at WLUP where he met overnight DJ [[Garry Meier]] (who was then broadcasting under the [[pseudonym]] of \"Matthew Meier\"). Shortly thereafter, the two began a cross talk that eventually led to Meier being teamed up with Dahl as both [[sidekick]] and newsman.<ref name=\"CST121089\" /><ref name=\"CT110694\" />  Dahl effectively forced Meier to use his actual name by calling him \"Garry\" on-air accidentally. After openly discussing the subject, again, on-air, Meier officially dropped his pseudonym.\n\n==== Disco Demolition Night ====\n{{Main|Disco Demolition Night}}\nIn response to Dahl's firing from WDAI, Dahl and Meier mocked and heaped scorn on disco records and WDAI (calling it \"Disco-D.I.E.\" mocking the station's slogan, \"Disco-D.A.I.\") on the air. Dahl even recorded and started playing a parody of [[Rod Stewart]]'s \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]\", which he called \"Do You Think I'm Disco?\". The song managed to crack the national charts to peak at No. 58 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|Hot 100]] and received airplay across the country.<ref name=\"CT110694\" />\n\nDuring this same time period, Dahl and Meier, along with Mike Veeck (son of then [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Bill Veeck]]), Jeff Schwartz of WLUP Sales and Dave Logan, the WLUP Promotions Director, came up with a radio promotion and tie-in to the White Sox called Disco Demolition Night which took place on Thursday, July 12, 1979. The concept was to create an event to \"end disco once and for all\" in the [[Baseball field#outfield|center field]] of [[Comiskey Park]] that night by allowing people to get tickets at the box office if they brought $0.98 (for WLUP's frequency) and at least one disco record.<ref name=\"sw010\">{{cite news|first=Macaulay|last=Campbell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/16/business/media-shock-waves.html|title=Media; Shock Waves|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2002-09-16|accessdate=2014-12-25}}</ref> More than 50,000 fans showed up, the records were collected, piled up on the field and blown up. As the second game of the [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] was about to begin, the raucous crowd [[Pitch invasion|stormed onto the field]], refused to leave, and proceeded by setting [[Bonfire|fires]], tearing out seats and pieces of turf, and other damage. [[American League]] President [[Lee MacPhail]] later declared the second game of the doubleheader a [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] victory for the visiting [[Detroit Tigers]].

He established a [[Syndicate#Media|syndicate]] and the ''Steve & Garry'' show began airing in Detroit and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], where it performed well. However, in February 1981, WLUP fired Dahl, citing \"continued assaults on community standards\". \"It was going on in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me,\" Dahl later said.<ref name=\"CT110694\" /> Meier was offered the opportunity to continue the show by himself, but he refused.<ref name=\"CST121089\" />{{rquote|right|I always used to get ticked off when I would get lumped in with Howard Stern as being a [[shock jock]].

He also made on-the-air [[Prank call|prank phone calls]] to the \"Islamic Fried Chicken\" (a play on [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]), ordering buckets of chicken for the hostages in the US [[embassy]], for which the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] later reprimanded him.<ref name=\"CT070403\">{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-07-04/features/0307040100_1_steve-dahl-garry-meier-dahl-and-meier|title=You call that service?|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2003-07-04|accessdate=2014-12-25}}</ref> Dahl also parodied the [[John Wayne Gacy]] murders with his song \"Another Kid in the Crawl\" (to the tune of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Another Brick in the Wall]]\"). The playing of the song was stopped after parents of the murdered children called to complain.<ref name=\"DahlLeaves\" />\n\nDahl and Meier won a [[Emmy Award#Regional Emmys|local Emmy award]]<ref name=\"CST121089-2\" /> for a television special they did in 1981 called, ''Greetings from [[Graceland]]'', which was a comedy spoof on the tourist shrine<ref name=\"WSJ052595\">{{cite news|title=Roach Clips|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|page=Rhythm, 3|date=1995-05-25}}</ref> and featured [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] \"Uncle Vester\" selling Elvis cookbooks from the guardhouse.<ref name=\"CST121089\" />  They briefly had a morning television show, called ''It's Too Early'' on local Chicago station, [[WGBO-TV|WFBN-TV]], which nationally syndicated columnist [[Bob Greene]] called \"the best program on television\", \"amazing\", and \"hypnotic\" in his June 20, 1983 column.

Colford, a former writer for [[Long Island Newsday]], [[Howard Stern]] listened to tapes of Steve and Garry sent from Chicago by a friend of the chief engineer at WCCC Hartford. Colford claims Stern eventually developed his on-air style as a result of these tapes. Later, Stern was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).<ref name=\"col001\" />\n\n==== End of collaboration ====\n''Steve & Garry'' moved to WLS, but ultimately returned to WLUP where they stayed until their split in 1993. The alleged reason for the break-up was Dahl's on-the-air comments about Meier's new wife, commercial real-estate broker Cynthia Fircak, while the new couple were on their [[honeymoon]].<ref name=\"CT110694\"/> Meier also blamed Dahl's [[alcoholism]] and unpredictable behavior.

He is hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the [[Constitution of the United States]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. He co-wrote ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', co-founded the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], and served as the fifth [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of State]] from 1801 to 1809.\n\nBorn into a prominent [[Virginia]] [[Planter class|planter]] family, Madison served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and the [[Continental Congress]] during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He became dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the [[Articles of Confederation]] and helped organize the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], which produced a new constitution to supplant the Articles of Confederation. Madison's [[Virginia Plan]] served as the basis for the Constitutional Convention's deliberations, and he was one of the most influential individuals at the convention. Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution, and he joined with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Jay]] in writing ''The Federalist Papers'', a series of pro-ratification essays that was one of the most influential works of political science in American history.\n\nAfter the ratification of the Constitution, Madison emerged as an important leader in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and served as a close adviser to President [[George Washington]]. He was the main force behind the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights, which enshrines guarantees of personal freedoms and rights within the Constitution. During the early 1790s, Madison came to oppose the economic program and accompanying centralization of power favored by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] Alexander Hamilton. Along with [[Thomas Jefferson]], Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party, which was, alongside Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]], one of the nation's first major political parties. After Jefferson won the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]], Madison served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1801 to 1809. In that position, he supervised the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which doubled the size of the United States.\n\nMadison succeeded Jefferson with a victory in the [[1808 United States presidential election|1808 presidential election]]. After diplomatic protests and a trade embargo failed to end [[United Kingdom|British]] attacks against American shipping, he led the United States into the [[War of 1812]]. The war was an administrative morass and ended inconclusively, but many Americans saw it as a successful \"second war of independence\" against Britain. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government, and he presided over the creation of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and the enactment of the [[Protectionism in the United States|protective]] [[Tariff of 1816]]. He retired from public office in 1817 and died in 1836. Madison was never able to privately reconcile his Republican beliefs and his slave ownership. Madison is considered to be one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States, and [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|historians have generally ranked]] him as an above-average president. \n\n==Early life and education==\n\nJames Madison Jr. was born on March 16, 1751, (March 5, 1750, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]) at [[Belle Grove (Port Conway, Virginia)|Belle Grove Plantation]] near [[Port Conway, Virginia]], to [[James Madison Sr.]] and [[Nelly Conway Madison]]. His family had lived in Virginia since the mid-1600s.{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=57}} Madison grew up as the oldest of twelve children,<ref>{{harvnb|Ketcham|1990|p=12}}</ref> with seven brothers and four sisters, though only six of his siblings would live to adulthood.<ref name=\"montpelier1\"/> His father was a [[Tobacco in the American colonies|tobacco planter]] who grew up on a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], then called [[Montpelier (James Madison)|Mount Pleasant]], which he had inherited upon reaching adulthood. With an estimated 100 [[slavery in the United States|slaves]]{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=57}} and a {{convert|5000|acre}} plantation, Madison's father was the largest landowner and a leading citizen in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. Madison's maternal grandfather was a prominent planter and tobacco merchant.<ref>{{harvnb|Ketcham|1990|p=5}}.</ref> In the early 1760s, the Madison family moved into a newly built house, which they named [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]].<ref name=\"montpelier1\">{{cite web|title=The Life of James Madison|url=http://www.montpelier.org/learn/the-life-of-james-madison|website=James Madison's Montpelier|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1811, Sharples, James, James Madison.jpg|thumb|Madison at Princeton University, portrait by [[James Sharples]]]]\n\nFrom age 11 to 16, Madison was sent to study under Donald Robertson, a Scottish instructor who served as a tutor for a number of prominent planter families in the South.

Unlike most college-bound Virginians of his day, Madison did not attend the [[College of William and Mary]], where the lowland [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] climate - thought to be more likely to harbor infectious disease - might have strained his delicate health. Instead, in 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=3\u20137}}</ref>\n\nHis studies at Princeton included Latin, Greek, theology, and the works of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=5\u20136}}</ref> Great emphasis was placed on both speech and debate; Madison was a leading member of the [[American Whig\u2013Cliosophic Society|American Whig Society]], in direct competition to the Cliosophian Society.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ketcham |first1=Ralph |title=James Madison: A Biography |date=2003 |publisher=American Political Biography Press |location=Newtown, CT |page=35}}</ref> During his time at Princeton, his closest friend was [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|future Attorney General William Bradford]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ketcham |first1=Ralph |title=James Madison: A Biography |date=2003 |publisher=American Political Biography Press |location=Newtown, CT |page=34}}</ref> Along with another classmate, Madison undertook an intense program of study and completed Princeton's three-year bachelor of arts degree in just two years, graduating in 1771.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Madison had contemplated entering into either the clergy or lawyer professions, but declined.{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=57}} He remained at Princeton to study Hebrew and [[political philosophy]] under President [[John Witherspoon]] before returning home to Montpelier in early 1772.<ref>{{harvnb|Ketcham|1990|page=51}}.</ref> His ideas on philosophy and morality were strongly shaped by Witherspoon, who converted Madison to the philosophy, values, and modes of thinking of the Age of Enlightenment. Biographer Terence Ball says that at Princeton:\n:He was immersed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment, and converted to eighteenth-century political radicalism. From then on James Madison's theories would advance the rights of happiness of man, and his most active efforts would serve devotedly the cause of civil and political liberty.<ref>{{cite book|author=Terence Ball|title=James Madison|url={{Google books|y_dADwAAQBAJ|page=PT45|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\nAfter returning to Montpelier, without a chosen career, Madison served as a tutor to his younger siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n===Studied law===\nMadison began to study law books on his own in 1773. Madison asked a Princeton friend William Bradford, a law apprentice under Edward Shippen in Philadelphia, to send him an ordered written plan on reading law books. At the age of 22, there was no evidence that Madison, himself, made any effort to apprentice under any lawyer in Virginia. By 1783, he had acquired a good sense of legal publications. Madison saw himself as a law student but never as a lawyer \u2013 he never joined the bar or practiced. In his elder years, Madison was sensative to the phrase \"demi-Lawyer\", or \"half-Lawyer\", a derisive term used to describe someone who read law books, but did not practice law.<ref>Mary Sarah Bilder. \"James Madison, Law Student and Demi-Lawyer.\" ''Law and History Review'' 28#2 (2010): 389-449 [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=lsfp online].</ref> \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}\nIn 1765, after the passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], the British-American colonies of North America broke from the British Empire, demanding proper representation and independence, known as the [[American Revolution]]. The British Crown, however, declined to grant the British-American colonies representation in [[Parliament of Britain|Parliament]] or independence, after aiding the colonists fight the costly [[French and Indian War]]. By the early 1770s the relationship between the British-American colonies and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] deteriorated over the issue of British taxation, culminating in the [[American Revolutionary War]], which began in 1775. The American colonists split between two factions, the Loyalists to King George III, and the Patriots, that Madison joined, under control of the Continental Congress. Madison believed that Parliament had overstepped its bounds by imposing taxation on the British-American colonies, and he sympathized with those who resisted British rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=17\u201318}}</ref> He also favored de-establishing the [[Anglican Church]] in Virginia; Madison believed that an established religion was detrimental not only for restricting [[freedom of religion]], but also because it encouraged closed-mindedness and unquestioning obedience to the authority of the state.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=10\u201314}}</ref>\n\n[[File:James Madison, by Charles Willson Peale, 1783.png|thumb|upright|Congressman Madison, age 32 by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]\n\nIn 1774, Madison, took a seat on the local Committee of Safety, a pro-revolution group that oversaw the local Patriot militia.<ref name=Stagg>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/madison-life-before-the-presidency|editor-last=Stagg|editor-first=J.A.|publisher=Univ. of Virginia Miller Center|title=James Madison: Life Before the Presidency|accessdate=February 14, 2017|date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> In October 1775, he was commissioned as the colonel of the [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] militia, serving as his father's second-in-command until his election as a delegate to the [[Fifth Virginia Convention]], which was charged with producing Virginia's first [[constitution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|2002|pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Of short stature and frequently in poor health, Madison never saw battle in the Revolutionary War, but he rose to prominence in Virginia politics as a wartime leader.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=14\u201315}}</ref>. \n\nAt the Virginia constitutional convention, he convinced delegates to alter the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] to provide for \"equal entitlement,\" rather than mere \"tolerance,\" in the exercise of religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=25\u201327}}</ref> With the enactment of the Virginia constitution, Madison became part of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], and he was subsequently elected to the Virginia governor's Council of State.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=48\u201349, 59\u201360}}</ref> In that role, he became a close ally of Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> On July 4, 1776, the [[Declaration of Independence]] was published formally declaring 13 American states an independent nation, no longer under the Crown or British rule.\n\nMadison served on the Council of State from 1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the governing body of the United States.{{efn|After the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781, the Second Continental Congress became the [[Congress of the Confederation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2003|pages=230\u2013232}}</ref>}} The country faced a difficult war against Great Britain, as well as runaway [[inflation]], financial troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government.

Reflecting the centralization of power envisioned by Madison, the Virginia Plan granted the U.S. Senate the power to overturn any law passed by state governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=140\u2013141}}</ref> The Virginia Plan did not explicitly lay out the structure of the executive branch, but Madison himself favored a single executive.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=115\u2013117}}</ref> Many delegates were surprised to learn that the plan called for the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution, to be ratified by special conventions in each state rather than by the state legislatures.

However, delegates from small states successfully argued for more power for state governments and presented the [[New Jersey Plan]] as an alternative. In response, [[Roger Sherman]] proposed the [[Connecticut Compromise]], which sought to balance the interests of small and large states. During the course of the convention, Madison's Council of Revision was jettisoned, each state was given equal representation in the Senate, and the state legislatures, rather than the House of Representatives, were given the power to elect members of the Senate. Madison was able to convince his fellow delegates to have the Constitution ratified by ratifying conventions rather than state legislatures, which he distrusted. He also helped ensure that the president of the United States would have the ability to veto federal laws and would be elected independently of Congress through the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. By the end of the convention, Madison believed that the new constitution failed to give enough power to the federal government compared to the state governments, but he still viewed the document as an improvement on the Articles of Confederation.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=152\u2013166, 171}}</ref>\n\nThe ultimate question before the convention, Wood notes, was not how to design a government but whether the states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between.<ref name=\"WoodGordon_a\">{{harvnb|Wood|2011|page=183}}.</ref> Most of the delegates at the Philadelphia Convention wanted to empower the federal government to raise revenue and protect [[property rights]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=148\u2013149}}</ref> Those, like Madison, who thought democracy in the state legislatures was excessive and insufficiently \"disinterested\", wanted sovereignty transferred to the national government, while those who did not think this a problem, wanted to fix the Articles of Confederation. Even many delegates who shared Madison's goal of strengthening the central government reacted strongly against the extreme change to the ''status quo'' envisioned in the Virginia Plan. Though Madison lost most of his battles over how to amend the Virginia Plan, in the process he increasingly shifted the debate away from a position of pure state sovereignty. Since most disagreements over what to include in the constitution were ultimately disputes over the balance of sovereignty between the states and national government, Madison's influence was critical. Wood notes that Madison's ultimate contribution was not in designing any particular constitutional framework, but in shifting the debate toward a compromise of \"shared sovereignty\" between the national and state governments.<ref name=\"WoodGordon_a\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Stewart|2007|page=182}}.</ref>\n\n===''The Federalist Papers'' and ratification debates===\n{{Main|The Federalist Papers}}\n{{See also|Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution}}\n\nAfter the Philadelphia Convention ended in September 1787, Madison convinced his fellow Congressmen to remain neutral in the ratification debate and allow each state to vote upon the Constitution.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=164\u2013166}}</ref> Throughout the United States, opponents of the Constitution, known as [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], began a public campaign against ratification.

It was his last appearance as a statesman. The issue of greatest importance at this convention was [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]]. The western districts of Virginia complained that they were underrepresented because the state constitution apportioned voting districts by county. The increased population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented by delegates in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison tried in vain to effect a compromise. Eventually, suffrage rights were extended to renters as well as landowners, but the eastern planters refused to adopt citizen population apportionment. They added slaves held as property to the population count, to maintain a permanent majority in both houses of the legislature, arguing that there must be a balance between population and property represented. Madison was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to resolve the issue more equitably.<ref>{{harvnb|Keysaar|2009|pages=26\u201327}}.</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historic legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, adding and deleting words and sentences, and shifting characters. By the time he had reached his late seventies, this \"straightening out\" had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]\u2014Madison not only inked out original passages, but even forged Jefferson's handwriting as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|2002|page=162}}.</ref> Historian [[Drew R.

Although Madison had championed a Republican form of government, he believed that slavery had caused the South to become aristocratic. Madison believed that slaves were human property, while he opposed slavery intellectually.{{sfn|Watts|1990|p=1289}} Along with his colonization plan for blacks, Madison, believed that slavery would naturally diffuse with western expansion. Madison's political views landed somewhere between [[John C. Calhoun]]'s separation nullification and [[Daniel Webster]]'s nationalism consolidation. Madison's Virginian \"legatees\" including [[Edward Coles]], Nicolas P. Trist, and William Cabel Rives promoted Madison's moderate views on slavery into the 1840's and 1850's, but their campaign failed due to sectionalism, economic, and abolitionism forces.{{sfn|Watts|1990|p=1289}} Madison was never able to reconcile his advocacy of Republican government and his life long reliance on the slave system.{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=57}}\n\nMadison's treatment of his enslaved people was known to be moderate. In 1790, Madison ordered an overseer to treat slaves with \"all the humanity and kindness of consistent with their necessary subordination and work.\" Visitors noted slaves were well housed and fed.

Billey, however, was drowned on a voyage to [[New Orleans]].{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|pp=188-189}} Madison never outwardly expressed blacks were inferior, but he presumably held such a belief. He tended to express open-mindedness on the question of race.{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|p=188}}\n\nBy 1801, Madison's slave population at [[Montpelier]] was slightly over 100.

He co-wrote ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', co-founded the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], and served as the fifth [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of State]] from 1801 to 1809.\n\nBorn into a prominent [[Virginia]] [[Planter class|planter]] family, Madison served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and the [[Continental Congress]] during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He became dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the [[Articles of Confederation]] and helped organize the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], which produced a new constitution to supplant the Articles of Confederation. Madison's [[Virginia Plan]] served as the basis for the Constitutional Convention's deliberations, and he was one of the most influential individuals at the convention. Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution, and he joined with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Jay]] in writing ''The Federalist Papers'', a series of pro-ratification essays that was one of the most influential works of political science in American history.\n\nAfter the ratification of the Constitution, Madison emerged as an important leader in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and served as a close adviser to President [[George Washington]]. He was the main force behind the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights, which enshrines guarantees of personal freedoms and rights within the Constitution. During the early 1790s, Madison came to oppose the economic program and accompanying centralization of power favored by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] Alexander Hamilton. Along with [[Thomas Jefferson]], Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party, which was, alongside Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]], one of the nation's first major political parties. After Jefferson won the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]], Madison served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1801 to 1809. In that position, he supervised the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which doubled the size of the United States.\n\nMadison succeeded Jefferson with a victory in the [[1808 United States presidential election|1808 presidential election]]. After diplomatic protests and a trade embargo failed to end [[United Kingdom|British]] attacks against American shipping, he led the United States into the [[War of 1812]]. The war was an administrative morass and ended inconclusively, but many Americans saw it as a successful \"second war of independence\" against Britain. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government, and he presided over the creation of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and the enactment of the [[Protectionism in the United States|protective]] [[Tariff of 1816]]. He retired from public office in 1817 and died in 1836. Madison was never able to privately reconcile his Republican beliefs and his slave ownership. Madison is considered to be one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States, and [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|historians have generally ranked]] him as an above-average president. \n\n==Early life and education==\n\nJames Madison Jr. was born on March 16, 1751, (March 5, 1750, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]) at [[Belle Grove (Port Conway, Virginia)|Belle Grove Plantation]] near [[Port Conway, Virginia]], to [[James Madison Sr.]] and [[Nelly Conway Madison]].

Madison asked a Princeton friend William Bradford, a law apprentice under Edward Shippen in Philadelphia, to send him an ordered written plan on reading law books. At the age of 22, there was no evidence that Madison, himself, made any effort to apprentice under any lawyer in Virginia. By 1783, he had acquired a good sense of legal publications. Madison saw himself as a law student but never as a lawyer \u2013 he never joined the bar or practiced. In his elder years, Madison was sensative to the phrase \"demi-Lawyer\", or \"half-Lawyer\", a derisive term used to describe someone who read law books, but did not practice law.<ref>Mary Sarah Bilder. \"James Madison, Law Student and Demi-Lawyer.\" ''Law and History Review'' 28#2 (2010): 389-449 [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=lsfp online].</ref> \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}\nIn 1765, after the passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], the British-American colonies of North America broke from the British Empire, demanding proper representation and independence, known as the [[American Revolution]]. The British Crown, however, declined to grant the British-American colonies representation in [[Parliament of Britain|Parliament]] or independence, after aiding the colonists fight the costly [[French and Indian War]]. By the early 1770s the relationship between the British-American colonies and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] deteriorated over the issue of British taxation, culminating in the [[American Revolutionary War]], which began in 1775. The American colonists split between two factions, the Loyalists to King George III, and the Patriots, that Madison joined, under control of the Continental Congress. Madison believed that Parliament had overstepped its bounds by imposing taxation on the British-American colonies, and he sympathized with those who resisted British rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=17\u201318}}</ref> He also favored de-establishing the [[Anglican Church]] in Virginia; Madison believed that an established religion was detrimental not only for restricting [[freedom of religion]], but also because it encouraged closed-mindedness and unquestioning obedience to the authority of the state.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=10\u201314}}</ref>\n\n[[File:James Madison, by Charles Willson Peale, 1783.png|thumb|upright|Congressman Madison, age 32 by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]\n\nIn 1774, Madison, took a seat on the local Committee of Safety, a pro-revolution group that oversaw the local Patriot militia.<ref name=Stagg>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/madison-life-before-the-presidency|editor-last=Stagg|editor-first=J.A.|publisher=Univ. of Virginia Miller Center|title=James Madison: Life Before the Presidency|accessdate=February 14, 2017|date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> In October 1775, he was commissioned as the colonel of the [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] militia, serving as his father's second-in-command until his election as a delegate to the [[Fifth Virginia Convention]], which was charged with producing Virginia's first [[constitution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|2002|pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Of short stature and frequently in poor health, Madison never saw battle in the Revolutionary War, but he rose to prominence in Virginia politics as a wartime leader.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=14\u201315}}</ref>. \n\nAt the Virginia constitutional convention, he convinced delegates to alter the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] to provide for \"equal entitlement,\" rather than mere \"tolerance,\" in the exercise of religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=25\u201327}}</ref> With the enactment of the Virginia constitution, Madison became part of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], and he was subsequently elected to the Virginia governor's Council of State.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=48\u201349, 59\u201360}}</ref> In that role, he became a close ally of Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> On July 4, 1776, the [[Declaration of Independence]] was published formally declaring 13 American states an independent nation, no longer under the Crown or British rule.\n\nMadison served on the Council of State from 1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the governing body of the United States.{{efn|After the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781, the Second Continental Congress became the [[Congress of the Confederation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2003|pages=230\u2013232}}</ref>}} The country faced a difficult war against Great Britain, as well as runaway [[inflation]], financial troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government.

Reflecting the centralization of power envisioned by Madison, the Virginia Plan granted the U.S. Senate the power to overturn any law passed by state governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=140\u2013141}}</ref> The Virginia Plan did not explicitly lay out the structure of the executive branch, but Madison himself favored a single executive.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2017|pages=115\u2013117}}</ref> Many delegates were surprised to learn that the plan called for the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution, to be ratified by special conventions in each state rather than by the state legislatures. Nonetheless, with the assent of prominent attendees such as Washington and [[Benjamin Franklin]], the delegates went into a secret session to consider a new constitution.<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|2002|pages=25\u201327}}.</ref>\n\nThough the Virginia Plan was an outline rather than a draft of a possible constitution, and though it was extensively changed during the debate, its use at the convention has led many to call Madison the \"Father of the Constitution.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Stewart|2007|page=181}}.</ref> During the course of the convention, Madison spoke over two hundred times, and his fellow delegates rated him highly.

However, delegates from small states successfully argued for more power for state governments and presented the [[New Jersey Plan]] as an alternative. In response, [[Roger Sherman]] proposed the [[Connecticut Compromise]], which sought to balance the interests of small and large states. During the course of the convention, Madison's Council of Revision was jettisoned, each state was given equal representation in the Senate, and the state legislatures, rather than the House of Representatives, were given the power to elect members of the Senate. Madison was able to convince his fellow delegates to have the Constitution ratified by ratifying conventions rather than state legislatures, which he distrusted. He also helped ensure that the president of the United States would have the ability to veto federal laws and would be elected independently of Congress through the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. By the end of the convention, Madison believed that the new constitution failed to give enough power to the federal government compared to the state governments, but he still viewed the document as an improvement on the Articles of Confederation.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=152\u2013166, 171}}</ref>\n\nThe ultimate question before the convention, Wood notes, was not how to design a government but whether the states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between.<ref name=\"WoodGordon_a\">{{harvnb|Wood|2011|page=183}}.</ref> Most of the delegates at the Philadelphia Convention wanted to empower the federal government to raise revenue and protect [[property rights]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=148\u2013149}}</ref> Those, like Madison, who thought democracy in the state legislatures was excessive and insufficiently \"disinterested\", wanted sovereignty transferred to the national government, while those who did not think this a problem, wanted to fix the Articles of Confederation. Even many delegates who shared Madison's goal of strengthening the central government reacted strongly against the extreme change to the ''status quo'' envisioned in the Virginia Plan. Though Madison lost most of his battles over how to amend the Virginia Plan, in the process he increasingly shifted the debate away from a position of pure state sovereignty. Since most disagreements over what to include in the constitution were ultimately disputes over the balance of sovereignty between the states and national government, Madison's influence was critical. Wood notes that Madison's ultimate contribution was not in designing any particular constitutional framework, but in shifting the debate toward a compromise of \"shared sovereignty\" between the national and state governments.<ref name=\"WoodGordon_a\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Stewart|2007|page=182}}.</ref>\n\n===''The Federalist Papers'' and ratification debates===\n{{Main|The Federalist Papers}}\n{{See also|Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution}}\n\nAfter the Philadelphia Convention ended in September 1787, Madison convinced his fellow Congressmen to remain neutral in the ratification debate and allow each state to vote upon the Constitution.<ref>{{harvnb|Burstein|Isenberg|2010|pages=164\u2013166}}</ref> Throughout the United States, opponents of the Constitution, known as [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], began a public campaign against ratification.

It was his last appearance as a statesman. The issue of greatest importance at this convention was [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]]. The western districts of Virginia complained that they were underrepresented because the state constitution apportioned voting districts by county. The increased population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented by delegates in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison tried in vain to effect a compromise. Eventually, suffrage rights were extended to renters as well as landowners, but the eastern planters refused to adopt citizen population apportionment. They added slaves held as property to the population count, to maintain a permanent majority in both houses of the legislature, arguing that there must be a balance between population and property represented. Madison was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to resolve the issue more equitably.<ref>{{harvnb|Keysaar|2009|pages=26\u201327}}.</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historic legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, adding and deleting words and sentences, and shifting characters. By the time he had reached his late seventies, this \"straightening out\" had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]\u2014Madison not only inked out original passages, but even forged Jefferson's handwriting as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|2002|page=162}}.</ref> Historian [[Drew R.

Although Madison had championed a Republican form of government, he believed that slavery had caused the South to become aristocratic. Madison believed that slaves were human property, while he opposed slavery intellectually.{{sfn|Watts|1990|p=1289}} Along with his colonization plan for blacks, Madison, believed that slavery would naturally diffuse with western expansion. Madison's political views landed somewhere between [[John C. Calhoun]]'s separation nullification and [[Daniel Webster]]'s nationalism consolidation. Madison's Virginian \"legatees\" including [[Edward Coles]], Nicolas P. Trist, and William Cabel Rives promoted Madison's moderate views on slavery into the 1840's and 1850's, but their campaign failed due to sectionalism, economic, and abolitionism forces.{{sfn|Watts|1990|p=1289}} Madison was never able to reconcile his advocacy of Republican government and his life long reliance on the slave system.{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=57}}\n\nMadison's treatment of his enslaved people was known to be moderate. In 1790, Madison ordered an overseer to treat slaves with \"all the humanity and kindness of consistent with their necessary subordination and work.\" Visitors noted slaves were well housed and fed. According to Paul Jennings, one of Madison's younger slaves, Madison never lost his temper or had his slaves whipped, preferring to reprimand.{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|pp=188-189}} One slave, Billey, attempted to escape Madison while in Philadelphia during the [[American Revolution]], but was caught. Rather than return him to [[Virginia]], Madison sold Billey in Philadelphia, under a gradual emancipation law adopted in [[Pennsylvania]]. Billey soon earned his freedom and worked for a [[Philadelphia]] merchant. Billey, however, was drowned on a voyage to [[New Orleans]].{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|pp=188-189}} Madison never outwardly expressed blacks were inferior, but he presumably held such a belief. He tended to express open-mindedness on the question of race.{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|p=188}}\n\nBy 1801, Madison's slave population at [[Montpelier]] was slightly over 100. During the 1820s and 1830s, Madison was forced to sell land and slaves, caused by debts. In 1836, at the time of Madison's death, Madison owned 36 taxable slaves.{{sfn|Broadwater|2012|p=188}}\n\n==Physical characteristics and health==\n[[File:James Madison by Gilbert Stuart.jpg|right|180px|thumb|'''James Madison'''<br>[[Gilbert Stuart]] ''1805-1807'']]\n\nMadison was small in stature, had bright blue eyes, a strong demeanor, and was known to be humorous at small gatherings. Madison suffered from serious illnesses, nervousness, and was often exausted after periods of stress. Madison often feared for the worst and was a [[hypochondriac]].

instances of Fogle's illegal behavior that were reported to senior management, including the allegation that Subway's senior vice president of marketing hushed up a 2004 incident in which Fogle propositioned a young girl at a promotional event at a Subway franchise in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017, with the judge writing that the court

Victims 13 and 14; since it would be the state government rather than the federal government, doing so would not violate [[double jeopardy]]. Potential state crimes would include statutory rape and/or trafficking persons for sexual reasons. New York defense attorney and former assistant district attorney Matthew R. Smalls stated that New York State is unlikely to bring state charges since it would have to make a new investigation and get testimony from victims. Abby Phillip of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated \"As a legal matter, Fogle may never be charged with rape \u2014 or legally labeled with having committed that crime.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Abby|last=Phillip|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/25/jared-fogle-admitted-to-sex-crimes-against-minors-why-wasnt-he-charged-with-rape/|title=Jared Fogle admitted to sex crimes against minors.

The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions, as well as transfer fee records paid and received by the club. A list of streaks recording all elements of the game (wins, losses, clean sheets, etc.) is also presented.\n\n==Honours==\nIn the all-time top flight league table since the league's inception in 1888, Wolves sit in the top fifteen, in terms of all-time English first level league position.<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html |title= a) England \u2014 First Level All-Time Tables |publisher=-\u2014-\u2014}}{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engprof-alltime.html |title= b) England \u2014 Professional Football All-Time Tables |publisher=RSSSF}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, they sit in the top four, behind only [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in terms of all-time league position from points gained at any level of English professional football.<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html |title= a) England \u2014 First Level All-Time Tables |publisher=-\u2014-\u2014}}{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engprof-alltime.html |title= b) England \u2014 Professional Football All-Time Tables |publisher=RSSSF}}</ref>\n\nCumulatively, they are the joint 11th most successful club in domestic English football history, tied with [[Nottingham Forest F.C. |Nottingham Forest]]. One place behind [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], with nine major trophy wins, not including super cups. Alternatively they are joint 10th with Nottingham Forrest, in competitive honours with 13 trophy wins, behind [[Newcastle United F.C. |Newcastle United]].(see [[List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won|here]]).\n\nUniquely, they are the only club to have won titles in five different Football League divisions,<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> and, in 1988, became the first team to have been champions of all four professional leagues in English football; although this feat has since been matched by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] (in 1992) and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] (in 1996). They remain the only club to have won all the main domestic cup competitions ([[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Football League Trophy]]) currently contested in English football.<ref>\"Wolves completed the set when they won the (then) Sherpa Van Trophy in 1988.
