It served as their debut single and lead single from their debut studio album, ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011). Written by [[Savan Kotecha]] and producer [[Rami Yacoub]], the song was released by [[Syco Records]] on 11 September 2011. The uptempo [[power pop]]<ref name=Powerpop/> track features a prominent guitar-based chorus and [[riff]]. The [[middle eight]] consists of a \"na na na\" [[hook (music)|hook]] while the opening guitar riff interpolates [[The McCoys]]'s 1965 single \"[[Hang on Sloopy]]\".\n'What makes you beautiful\" was written for a very special person called ADA\n\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries. It has been certified quadruple platinum in the US with sales of 4.8 million copies as of June 2016.<ref name=\"USsales2016\"/> The single peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song won the [[2012 Brit Awards|2012]] [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year]] and was generally complimented by contemporary [[Music journalism|music critics]], who highlighted the appeal to the teenage audience and the pop sensibility. It debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after setting a [[Sony Music Entertainment]] pre-order record and selling 153,965 copies in its first week. The single also topped the [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]] and [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish]] Singles Charts, and reached the top ten on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] and [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand]] Singles Charts, Flemish [[Ultratop 50]], [[Canadian Hot 100]], and the [[Japan Hot 100]].\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], directed by John Urbano, depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in [[Malibu, California]]. The music video was uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2011 and has accumulated more than 1.1 billion views since it premiered.  The clip garnered the group three [[MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards|2012 ceremony]]. One Direction performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and on four of their major concert tours: [[Up All Night Tour]] (2011\u201312), [[Take Me Home Tour (One Direction)|Take Me Home Tour]] (2013), [[Where We Are Tour (One Direction)|Where We Are Tour]] (2014) and [[On the Road Again Tour]] (2015). Harry Styles performed the song on his [[Harry Styles: Live on Tour|2017 solo tour]]. Artists including [[the Piano Guys]] have covered \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\n\n==Background and production==\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was written by [[Savan Kotecha]] and [[Carl Falk]], and was produced by Yacoub and Falk. Instrumentation was completed by Falk and Yacoub. Serban Ghenea handled the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]], Tom Coyne the [[audio mastering]], and John Hanes the [[mix engineer]]ing, for which Phil Seaford served as the assistant.<ref name=\"credits\"/> Discussing the song's conception, Kotecha said: {{cquote|I had the melody of the chorus in my song for about a year until I was in a hotel room in London with my wife and she was having a bad morning. She was like, \"Oh, I feel so ugly\" and I was like, \"No, you look beautiful. You don\u2019t know how beautiful you look.\" And I was like, \"Oh, crap! That\u2019s a good song! Hold on!\" And I wrote that down. I actually wrote the song for my wife, so I went to the studio and it took a process of a couple weeks to really tweak it, but the core of it was written within two days and then tweaked a few things here and there over a couple weeks, but I mean, I still have the text message from Harry [Styles]. When he heard the demo, I was in Miami on my way back to Sweden, and he sent me a text message saying, \"I think you got it.

Columbia Records co-chairman Steve Barnett and his team decided to reverse the usual pattern of releasing a single on radio. Instead the label mounted a four-month marketing campaign aimed at building a fan base through social media before a single was ever released or played on the radio. The social media campaign asked fans to sign petitions and to enter video competitions to win a concert in their town. The campaign was a success as One Direction's [[Facebook]] followers in the United States rose from 40,000 to 400,000. As a result, \"What Makes You Beautiful\" sold more than 131,000 copies in its first week, even though it had yet to be played on the radio. Radio programmers were flooded with calls from fans. [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], who managed [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]], said: \"Now they are calling the radio station, and the radio station is scratching its head, saying, \"We don't even have that record yet\". It's almost like the return of [[the Beatles]]. I call it hype, but it's positive hype because it's all real. It's not manufactured. No one paid these kids.\"<ref>{{cite news| author=James C.

Makes You Beautiful'''\" is a song by English-Irish [[boy band]] [[One Direction]]. It served as their debut single and lead single from their debut studio album, ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011). Written by [[Savan Kotecha]] and producer [[Rami Yacoub]], the song was released by [[Syco Records]] on 11 September 2011. The uptempo [[power pop]]<ref name=Powerpop/> track features a prominent guitar-based chorus and [[riff]]. The [[middle eight]] consists of a \"na na na\" [[hook (music)|hook]] while the opening guitar riff interpolates [[The McCoys]]'s 1965 single \"[[Hang on Sloopy]]\".\n\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries. It has been certified quadruple platinum in the US with sales of 4.8 million copies as of June 2016.<ref name=\"USsales2016\"/> The single peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song won the [[2012 Brit Awards|2012]] [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year]] and was generally complimented by contemporary [[Music journalism|music critics]], who highlighted the appeal to the teenage audience and the pop sensibility. It debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after setting a [[Sony Music Entertainment]] pre-order record and selling 153,965 copies in its first week. The single also topped the [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]] and [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish]] Singles Charts, and reached the top ten on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] and [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand]] Singles Charts, Flemish [[Ultratop 50]], [[Canadian Hot 100]], and the [[Japan Hot 100]].\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], directed by John Urbano, depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in [[Malibu, California]]. The music video was uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2011 and has accumulated more than 1.1 billion views since it premiered.  The clip garnered the group three [[MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards|2012 ceremony]]. One Direction performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and on four of their major concert tours: [[Up All Night Tour]] (2011\u201312), [[Take Me Home Tour (One Direction)|Take Me Home Tour]] (2013), [[Where We Are Tour (One Direction)|Where We Are Tour]] (2014) and [[On the Road Again Tour]] (2015). Harry Styles performed the song on his [[Harry Styles: Live on Tour|2017 solo tour]]. Artists including [[the Piano Guys]] have covered \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\n\n==Background and production==\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was written by [[Savan Kotecha]] and [[Carl Falk]], and was produced by Yacoub and Falk. Instrumentation was completed by Falk and Yacoub. Serban Ghenea handled the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]], Tom Coyne the [[audio mastering]], and John Hanes the [[mix engineer]]ing, for which Phil Seaford served as the assistant.<ref name=\"credits\"/> Discussing the song's conception, Kotecha said: {{cquote|I had the melody of the chorus in my song for about a year until I was in a hotel room in London with my wife and she was having a bad morning. She was like, \"Oh, I feel so ugly\" and I was like, \"No, you look beautiful. You don\u2019t know how beautiful you look.\" And I was like, \"Oh, crap! That\u2019s a good song! Hold on!\" And I wrote that down. I actually wrote the song for my wife, so I went to the studio and it took a process of a couple weeks to really tweak it, but the core of it was written within two days and then tweaked a few things here and there over a couple weeks, but I mean, I still have the text message from Harry [Styles]. When he heard the demo, I was in Miami on my way back to Sweden, and he sent me a text message saying, \"I think you got it. I think you got the one here.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schillaci|first1=Sophie|title=Meet Savan Kotecha: The Man Behind One Direction's Rapid Rise to the Top (Q&A)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/one-direction-meet-man-rapid-418682|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 28, 2015|date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter recording the song at [[Cosmos Studios]] and Kinglet Studios in [[Stockholm]], Sweden,<ref name=\"credits\"/> the band felt relieved to have a song that they were happy to release as their debut single.

Columbia Records co-chairman Steve Barnett and his team decided to reverse the usual pattern of releasing a single on radio. Instead the label mounted a four-month marketing campaign aimed at building a fan base through social media before a single was ever released or played on the radio. The social media campaign asked fans to sign petitions and to enter video competitions to win a concert in their town. The campaign was a success as One Direction's [[Facebook]] followers in the United States rose from 40,000 to 400,000. As a result, \"What Makes You Beautiful\" sold more than 131,000 copies in its first week, even though it had yet to be played on the radio. Radio programmers were flooded with calls from fans.

A woman has her child taken away by its father, the great [[selkie]] of [[Sule Skerry]] which can transform from a seal into a human. The woman is fated to marry a gunner who will harpoon the selkie and their son.\n\n\"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\" is a short version from the Sheltands published in the 1850s and later listed as [[Child ballad]] number 113. \"The Grey Selkie of Sule Skerry\" is the title of the Orcadian texts, about twice in length. There is also a greatly embellished and expanded version of the ballad called \"The Lady Odivere\".\n\n==Shetland version==\n\"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\" was collected from a lady from Snarra Voe, Shetland, and 7 verses from its transcription was published by Capt. F. W. L. Thomas in the 1850s. It was later included in [[Francis James Child]]'s anthology, and catalogued as [[Child ballad]] number 113.<ref name=capt_thomas>Thomas, Capt. F. W. L.

A woman has her child taken away by its father, the great [[selkie]] of [[Sule Skerry]] which can transform from a seal into a human. The woman is fated to marry a gunner who will harpoon the selkie and their son.\n\n\"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\" is a short version from the Sheltands published in the 1850s and later listed as [[Child ballad]] number 113. \"The Grey Selkie of Sule Skerry\" is the title of the Orcadian texts, about twice in length. There is also a greatly embellished and expanded version of the ballad called \"The Lady Odivere\".\n\n==Shetland version==\n\"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\" was collected from a lady from Snarra Voe, Shetland, and 7 verses from its transcription was published by Capt. F. W. L. Thomas in the 1850s. It was later included in [[Francis James Child]]'s anthology, and catalogued as [[Child ballad]] number 113.<ref name=capt_thomas>Thomas, Capt. F. W. L.

Biddle wrote that \"laying claim to the name of a product that's the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room.

Ayyadurai reported that he had spent months trying to create a business plan for CSIR Tech, but received no response from Brahmachari.

He said that CSIR scientists reported that \"they work in a [[medieval]], [[feudalism|feudal]] environment\" that required a \"major overhaul\". The letter was co-authored by a colleague, Deepak Sardana. [[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa Bhargava]], founding director of the CSIR's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, endorsed the letter, calling Ayyadurai's sacking the worst of many cases he had seen of \"vindictiveness in the CSIR\" and accused CSIR administration of being \"impervious to healthy and fair criticism\".
