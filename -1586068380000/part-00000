The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

One female was recorded nesting five times in one season, though that many nest attempts is unusual.<ref name=\"SocialOrganization\" /> Bell miner pairs are monogamous, but the breeding tasks are divided between the sexes. Female bell miners build the nest over 8 days, incubate the 1-3 (but typically 2) eggs for 14.5 days, and brood the young for up to 12 days depending on the weather.<ref name=\"ReproductiveBehavior\" /> The nests are small, cup-shaped and built with dry twigs, grasses, and bark woven together with spider web.<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> Nests are generally hidden in the foliage of dense understory plants, 3-5m above the ground.<ref name=\"NestEgg\" /> The eggs are typically 24mm x 16mm, oval shaped, and pink in color.

France expected to exercise control over Hatay, Lebanon and Syria, and also wanted control over a portion of southeastern Anatolia based on the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]]. France signed the [[Franco-Armenian Agreement (1916)|Franco-Armenian Agreement]] and promised the realization of an Armenian state in the Mediterranean region in exchange to the [[French Armenian Legion]].<ref>[[Richard G. Hovannisian]], ''Armenia on the Road to Independence'', 1967.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Allied countries continued to lay claim to portions of the quickly crumbling Ottoman Empire. British forces based in Syria occupied [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Mara\u015f]], [[Urfa]] and [[Birecik]], while French forces embarked by [[gunboat]]s and sent troops to the [[Black Sea]] ports of [[Zonguldak]] and [[Karadeniz Ere\u011fli]] commanding Turkey's coal mining region. At the Paris Peace Conference, competing claims of [[Anatolia|Western Anatolia]] by Greek and Italian delegations led Greece to land the flagship of the [[Greek Navy]] at [[Smyrna]], resulting in the Italian delegation walking out of the peace talks. On 30 April, Italy responded to the possible idea of Greek incorporation of Western Anatolia by also sending a warship to Smyrna (Izmir) as a show of force against the Greek campaign. A large Italian force also landed in [[Antalya]]. With the Italian delegation absent from the Paris Peace talks, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] was able to sway [[French Third Republic|France]] in favour of Greece and ultimately the Conference authorized the landing of Greek troops on Anatolian territory.\n\nThe Greek campaign of Western Anatolia began on 15 May 1919, as Greek troops began landing in Smyrna. For the city's Muslim population, the day is marked by the \"first bullet\" fired by [[Hasan Tahsin]]<ref group=note>Mehmet \u00c7avu\u015f's fire against the French in D\u00f6rtyol was misknown until near past. But Hasan Tahsin's firing was the first bullet in West Front</ref> at the Greek standard bearer at the head of the troops, the murder by bayonet coups of [[Colonel|Miralay]] Fethi Bey for refusing to shout \"Zito [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]\" (meaning \"long live Venizelos\") and the killing and wounding of unarmed Turkish soldiers in the city's principal [[casern]], as well as of 300\u2013400 civilians. Greek troops moved from Smyrna outwards to towns on the Karaburun peninsula, to [[Sel\u00e7uk]], situated a hundred kilometers south of Smyrna at a key location that commands the fertile [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes River]] valley, and to [[Menemen]] towards the north.\n\n==Initial organization==\n[[File:Turkey and Turkish people during War of Independence.ogg|thumb|Anatolia in 1919]]\n\n''Fahr\u00ee Y\u00e2ver-i Hazret-i \u015eehriy\u00e2ri'' (\"Honorary ''Aide-de-camp'' to His Majesty Sultan\") [[Mirliva]] Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa was assigned as the inspector of the [[Ninth Army (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|9th Army Troops Inspectorate]] to reorganize what remained of the Ottoman military units and to improve internal security on 30 April 1919.<ref>Andrew Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', John Murray, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6592-2}}, p. 214.</ref> According to [[Lord Kinross]], through manipulation and the help of friends and sympathizers, Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa became the Inspector of virtually all of the Ottoman forces in Anatolia, tasked with overseeing the disbanding process of the remaining Ottoman forces.<ref>Lord Kinross.

''The Rebirth of a Nation'', chap 19.</ref>\n\nResistance to Allied demands began at the very onset of the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I. Many Ottoman officials organized the secret [[Sentinel Association]] ({{lang-tr|Karakol Cemiyeti}}) in reaction to the policies of the Allies. The objective of the Sentinel Association was to thwart Allied demands through passive and active resistance. Many Ottoman officials participated in efforts to conceal from the occupying authorities details of the burgeoning independence movement spreading throughout Anatolia. Munitions initially seized by the Allies were secretly smuggled out of Constantinople into Central Anatolia, along with Ottoman officers keen to resist any division of Ottoman territories. [[Mirliva]] [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy|Ali Fuad Pa\u015fa]] in the meantime had moved his [[XX Corps (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|XX Corps]] from Ere\u011fli to Ankara and started organizing resistance groups, including [[Circassians|Circassian]] immigrants under [[\u00c7erkes Ethem]].\n\nSince the southern rim of Anatolia{{Where|date=July 2011}} was effectively controlled by British warships and competing Greek and Italian troops, the Turkish National Movement's headquarters moved to the rugged terrain of central Anatolia. The reasons for these new assignments is still a matter of debate; one view is that it was an intentional move to support the national movement, another was that the Sultan wanted to keep Constantinople under his control, a goal which was in total agreement with the aims of the occupation armies which could keep the Sultan under control. The most prominent idea given for the Sultan's decision was by assigning these officers out of the capital, the Sultan was trying to minimize the effectiveness of these soldiers in the capital. The Sultan was cited as saying that without an organized army, the Allies could not be defeated, and the national movement had two army corps in May 1919,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} one was the XX Corps based in Ankara under the command of Ali Fuat Pa\u015fa and the other was [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|XV Corps]] based in [[Erzurum]] under the command of [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir|K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir Pa\u015fa]].\n\nMustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa and his colleagues stepped ashore on 19 May and set up their first quarters in the Mintika Palace Hotel. Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa made the people of Samsun aware of the Greek and Italian landings, staged mass meetings (while remaining discreet) and made, thanks to the excellent telegraph network, fast connections with the army units in Anatolia and began to form links with various nationalist groups. He sent telegrams of protest to foreign embassies and the War Ministry about British reinforcements in the area and about British aid to Greek brigand gangs. After a week in Samsun, Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa and his staff moved to [[Havza]], about {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland.\n\nMustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa writes in his memoir{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} that he needed nationwide support. The importance of his position, and his status as the \"Hero of Anafartalar\" after the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], and his title of Fahri Yaver-i Hazret-i \u015eehriyari (\"Honorary Aide-de-camp to His Majesty Sultan\") gave him some credentials. On the other hand, this was not enough to inspire everyone. While officially occupied with the disarming of the army, he had increased his various contacts in order to build his movement's momentum. He met with Rauf Bey (Orbay), Ali Fuat Pa\u015fa (Cebesoy), and Refet Bey (Bele) on 21 June 1919 and declared the [[Amasya Circular]] (22 June 1919).\n\n===Decoding national movement===\n[[File:Hal\u00e2sk\u00e2r\u00e2n-\u0131 \u0130sl\u00e2m afi\u015f.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster of the [[Turkish National Movement]]]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa, Erzurum, 5 Temmuz 1919.png|thumb|Mustafa Kemal and his colleagues in [[Erzurum Congress|Erzurum]] (5 July 1919)]]\nOn 23 June, High Commissioner [[Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe|Admiral Calthorpe]], realizing the significance of Mustafa Kemal's discreet activities in Anatolia, sent a report about Mustafa Kemal to the Foreign Office. His remarks were downplayed by George Kidson of the Eastern Department. Captain Hurst (British army) in Samsun warned Admiral Calthorpe one more time, but Hurst's units were replaced with the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]. The movement of British units alarmed the population of the region and convinced the population that Mustafa Kemal was right.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Right after this \"The Association for Defense of National Rights\" (M\u00fcdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti) was founded in Trabzon, and a parallel association in Samsun was also founded, which declared that the Black Sea region was not safe. The same activities that happened in Smyrna were happening in the region. When the British landed in [[Alexandretta]], Admiral Calthorpe resigned on the basis that this was against the Armistice that he had signed and was assigned to another position on 5 August 1919.<ref>Lord Kinross. (1999) ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Re-birth of a Nation'', chap. 16.</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Mustafa Kemal Pasha received a telegram from the Sultan. The Sultan asked him to cease his activities in Anatolia and return to the capital. Mustafa Kemal was in Erzincan and did not want to return to Constantinople, concerned that the foreign authorities might have designs for him beyond the Sultan's plans. He felt the best course for him was to take a two-month leave of absence.\n\nThe Representative committee was established at the [[Sivas Congress]] (4\u201311 September 1919).\n\n===Representational problem===\nOn 16 October 1919, [[Ali R\u0131za Pasha]] sent a navy minister, Hulusi Salih Pasha, to negotiate with the Turkish National Movement. Hulusi Salih Pasha was not part of World War I. Salih Pasha and Mustafa Kemal met in Amasya. Mustafa Kemal put the representational problems of Ottoman Parliament on the agenda. He wanted to have a signed protocol between Ali R\u0131za Pasha and the \"representative committee.\" On the advice of the British, Ali R\u0131za Pasha rejected any form of recognition or legitimacy claims by this unconstitutional political formation in Anatolia.\n\nIn December 1919, fresh elections were held for the Ottoman parliament. This was an attempt to build a better representative structure. The Ottoman parliament was seen as a way to reassert the central government's claims of legitimacy in response to the emerging nationalist movement in Anatolia. In the meantime, groups of Ottoman Greeks had formed Greek nationalist militias within Ottoman borders and were acting on their own. Greek members of the Ottoman parliament repeatedly blocked any progress in the parliament, and most Greek subjects of the Sultan boycotted the new elections.\n\nThe elections were held and a new parliament of the Ottoman State was formed under the occupation. However, Ali R\u0131za Pasha was too hasty in thinking that his parliament could bring him legitimacy. The house of the parliament was under the shadow of the British battalion stationed at Constantinople. Any decisions by the parliament had to have the signatures of both Ali R\u0131za Pasha and the commanding British Officer. The freedom of the new government was limited. It did not take too long for the members of parliament to recognize that any kind of integrity was not possible in this situation. Ali R\u0131za Pasha and his government had become the voice of the Triple Entente. The only laws that passed were those acceptable to, or specifically ordered by the British.\n\n===Last Ottoman Parliament===\n[[File:Mudanya July 1920 (1).jpg|thumb|Fire caused by the British bombardment in [[Mudanya]] (6 July 1920)]]\n\nOn 12 January 1920, the last Ottoman Chamber of Deputies met in the capital. First the Sultan's speech was presented and then a telegram from Mustafa Kemal, manifesting the claim that the rightful government of Turkey{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} being in Ankara in the name of the Representative Committee.\n\nA group called ''Fel\u00e2h-\u0131 Vatan'' among the Ottoman parliament worked to acknowledge the decisions taken at the [[Erzurum Congress]] and the [[Sivas Congress]]. The British began to sense that a Turkish Nationalist movement had been flourishing, a movement with goals against English interests. The Ottoman government was not doing all that it could to suppress the nationalists. On 28 January the deputies met secretly. Proposals were made to elect Mustafa Kemal president of the Chamber, but this was deferred in the certain knowledge that the British would prorogue the Chamber{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} before it could do what had been planned all along, namely accept the declaration of the Sivas Congress.\n\nOn 28 January, the Ottoman parliament developed the National Pact (Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee) and published it on 12 February. This pact adopted six principles, which called for self-determination, the security of Constantinople, and the opening of the Straits, also the abolition of the capitulations. In effect the Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee solidified a lot of nationalist notions, which were in conflict with the Allied plans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Shift from ''de facto'' to ''de jure'' occupation===\nThe National Movement\u2014which persuaded the Ottoman [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]] to declare a \"National Pact\" (''[[Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee]]'') against the occupying Allies\u2013prompted the British government to take action. To put an end to Turkish Nationalist hopes, the British decided to systematically bring Turkey under their control. The plan was to dismantle Turkish Government organizations, beginning in Istanbul and moving deep into Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal's National Movement was seen as the main problem. The British Foreign Office was asked to devise a plan. The Foreign Office suggested the same plan previously used during the [[Arab Revolt]]. This time however, resources were channeled to warlords like [[Ahmet Anzavur]]. The politics of this decision were legitimised via the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Anatolia was to be westernized under Christian governments. That was the only way that Christians could be safe, said the British government. The Treaty of S\u00e8vres placed most of Anatolia under Christian control. This policy aimed to break down authority in Anatolia by separating the Sultan, its government, and pitting Christians (Greece and [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], Armenians of Cilicia) against Muslims.\n\nOn the night of 15 March, British troops began to occupy key buildings and arrest Turkish nationalists. It was a very messy operation. At the military music school there was resistance. At least ten students died but the official death toll is unknown even today. The British tried to capture the leadership of the movement. They secured the departments of the Minister of War and of the Chief of the General Staff, Fevzi \u00c7akmak. \u00c7akmak was an able and relatively conservative officer who was known as one of the army's oldest field commanders. He soon became one of the principal military leaders of the National Movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Newspaper-the gray river march 18 1920.png|thumb|150px|A part from a newspaper published on 18 March 1920 (The Gray River Argus, New Zealand)]]\n\nMustafa Kemal was ready for this move. He warned all the nationalist organizations that there would be misleading declarations from the capital. He warned that the only way to stop the British was to organize protests. He said \"Today the Turkish nation is called to defend its capacity for civilization, its right to life and independence{{spaced ndash}}its entire future\". Mustafa Kemal was extensively familiar with the Arab Revolt and British involvement. He managed to stay one step ahead of the British Foreign Office. This\u2014as well as his other abilities\u2014gave Mustafa Kemal considerable authority among the revolutionaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOn 18 March the Ottoman parliament sent a protest to the Allies. The document stated that it was unacceptable to arrest five of its members. But the damage had been done. It was end of the Ottoman political system. This show of force by the British had left the Sultan as sole controller of the Empire. But the Sultan depended on their power to keep what was left of the empire. He was now a puppet of the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Jurisdictional conflict==\nThe new government\u2014hoping to undermine the National Movement\u2014passed a ''[[fatwa]]'' (legal opinion) from \u015eeyh\u00fclislam to qualify the Turkish revolutionaries as infidels, calling for the death of its leaders.<ref name=Ardic>{{cite book|last1=Ardic|first1=Nurullah|title=Islam and the Politics of Secularism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZAXNxxkJKYsC&pg=PA251&dq=fatwa+of+ankara#v=onepage&q=fatwa%20of%20ankara&f=false|accessdate=21 August 2014|isbn=9781136489846|date=21 August 2012}}</ref> The ''fatwa'' stated that true believers should not go along with the nationalist (rebels) movement. Along with this religious decree, the government sentenced Mustafa Kemal and prominent nationalists to death in absentia. At the same time, the m\u00fcfti of Ankara Rifat B\u00f6rek\u00e7i in defense of the nationalist movement, issued a counteracting fatwa declaring that the capital was under the control of the Entente and the Ferit Pasha government.<ref name=Vahide>{{cite book|last1=Vahide|first1=Sukran|title=Islam in Modern Turkey|date=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791482971|pages=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdX-iggjrxwC&pg=PA140&dq=fatwa+of+ankara#v=onepage&q=fatwa%20of%20ankara&f=false|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> In this text, the nationalist movement's goal was stated as freeing the sultanate and the caliphate from its enemies.\n\n===Dissolution of the Ottoman parliament===\nMustafa Kemal expected the Allies neither to accept the Harbord report nor to respect his parliamentary immunity if he went to the Ottoman capital, hence he remained in Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal moved the Representative Committee's capital from Erzurum to Ankara so that he could keep in touch with as many deputies as possible as they traveled to Constantinople to attend the parliament. He also started a newspaper, the ''Hakimiyet-i Milliye'' (''National Sovereignty''), to speak for the movement both in Turkey and the outside world (10 January 1920).\n\nMustafa Kemal declared that the only legal government of Turkey was the Representative Committee in Ankara and that all civilian and military officials were to obey it rather than the government in Constantinople. This argument gained very strong support, as by that time the Ottoman Parliament was fully under Allied control.\n\n===Promulgation of the Grand National Assembly===\nThe strong measures taken against the nationalists by the Ottoman government created a distinct new phase. Mustafa Kemal sent a note to the governors and force commanders, asking them to implement the election of delegates to join the GNA, which would convene in Ankara. Mustafa Kemal appealed to the Islamic world, asking for help to make sure that everyone knew he was still fighting in the name of the sultan who was also the caliph. He stated he wanted to free the caliph from the Allies. Plans were made to organize a new government and parliament in Ankara, and then ask the sultan to accept its authority.\n\nA flood of supporters moved to Ankara just ahead of the Allied dragnets. Included among them were [[Halide Edip]], Adnan (Ad\u0131var), \u0130smet (\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc), Mustafa Kemal's important allies in the Ministry of War, and Celaleddin Arif, the president of the Chamber of Deputies. [[Yunus Nadi Abal\u0131o\u011flu|Yunus Nadi]] (Abal\u0131o\u011flu), the owner of ''Yeni G\u00fcn'' newspaper, journalist-author and deputy of Izmir, Halide Edip (Ad\u0131var) met in Geyve on 31 March. Two intellectuals discussed the necessity that a news agency should be established to counter the allied occupation administration's censure over the news. They chose ''Anadolu'' as the name. Mustafa Kemal, whom they meet in Ankara, immediately launched initiatives to herald the establishment of the [[Anadolu Agency]].<ref name=\"nationalnewsagency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/tarihce_en/|title=History of Anadolu Agency|accessdate=16 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109132901/http://www.aa.com.tr/tarihce_en/|archivedate=9 January 2008}}</ref> Mustafa Kemal wanted to transmit news stories to the world. Kemal also stressed the importance of making the national struggle heard inside and outside of the country.<ref name=\"nationalnewsagency\"/> Celaleddin Arif's desertion of the capital was of great significance. Celaleddin Arif stated that the Ottoman Parliament had been dissolved illegally. The Armistice did not give Allies the power to dissolve the Ottoman Parliament and the Constitution of 1909 had also removed the Sultan's power to do so, to prevent what Abd\u00fclhamid did in 1879.\n\nSome 100 members of the Ottoman Parliament were able to escape the Allied roundup and joined 190 deputies elected around the country by the national resistance group. Ismet Inon\u00fc joined as a deputy from Edirne. In March 1920, Turkish revolutionaries announced that the Turkish nation was establishing its own Parliament in Ankara under the name [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] (GNA). The GNA assumed full governmental powers. On 23 April, the new Assembly gathered for the first time, making Mustafa Kemal its first president and Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc chief of the General Staff. The new regime's determination to revolt against the government in the capital and not the Sultan was quickly made evident. By 3 May 1920, a [[Turkish Provisional Government]] was also formed in [[Ankara]].\n\n===Early pressure on nationalist militias===\n[[File:Turkish revolutionaries-Kuvva-i Milliye.ogg|thumb|[[Kuva-yi Milliye]]]]\n\n{{Main|Revolts during the Turkish War of Independence}}\n\nAnatolia had many competing forces on its soil: British battalions, Ahmet Anzavur forces, and the Sultan's army. The Sultan gave 4,000 soldiers from his [[Kuva-i Inzibatiye]] (Caliphate Army) to resist against the nationalists. Then using money from the Allies, he raised another army, a force about 2,000 strong from non-Muslim inhabitants which were initially deployed in Iznik. The Sultan's government sent forces under the name of the caliphate army to the revolutionaries and aroused counterrevolutionary outbreaks.<ref>George F. Nafziger, ''Islam at War: A History'', p. 132.</ref>\n\nThe British being skeptical of how formidable these insurgents were, decided to use irregular power to counteract this rebellion. The nationalist forces were distributed all around Turkey, so many small units were dispatched to face them. In Izmit there were two battalions of the British army. Their commanders were living on the Ottoman warship ''Yavuz''. These units were to be used to rout the partisans under the command of Ali Fuat Cebesoy and Refet Bele.\n\nOn 13 April 1920, the first conflict occurred at D\u00fczce as a direct consequence of the sheik ul-Islam's ''fatwa''. On 18 April 1920, the D\u00fczce conflict was extended to Bolu; on 20 April 1920, it extended to Gerede. The movement engulfed an important part of northwestern Anatolia for about a month. The Ottoman government had accorded semi-official status to the \"Kuva-i Inzibatiye\" and Ahmet Anzavur held an important role in the uprising. Both sides faced each other in a pitched battle near Izmit on 14 June. Ahmet Anzavur's forces and British units outnumbered the militias. Yet under heavy attack some of the Kuva-i Inzibatiye deserted and joined the opposing ranks. This revealed the Sultan did not have the unwavering support of his men. Meanwhile, the rest of these forces withdrew behind the British lines which held their position.\n[[File:Execution of a Kemalist Turk in Izmit 1920.jpg|thumb|300px|Execution of a Kemalist Turk by the British forces in Izmit. (1920)]]\n\nThe clash outside Izmit brought serious consequences. The British forces opened fire on the nationalists and bombed them from the air. This bombing forced a retreat but there was a panic in Constantinople. The British commander\u2014General [[George Milne, 1st Baron Milne|George Milne]]\u2014asked for reinforcements. This led to a study to determine what would be required to defeat the Turkish nationalists. The report\u2014signed by Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch\u2014concluded that 27 divisions would be sufficient, but the British army did not have 27 divisions to spare. Also, a deployment of this size could have disastrous political consequences back home. World War I had just ended, and the British public would not support another lengthy and costly expedition.\n\nThe British accepted the fact that a nationalist movement could not be faced without deployment of consistent and well-trained forces. On 25 June, the forces originating from Kuva-i Inzibatiye were dismantled under British supervision. The official stance was that there was no use for them. The British realized that the best option to overcome these Turkish nationalists was to use a force that was battle-tested and fierce enough to fight the Turks on their own soil. The British had to look no further than Turkey's neighbor: Greece.\n\n===Establishment of the army===\nBefore the Amasya Circular (22 June 1919), Mustafa Kemal met with a Bolshevik delegation headed by Colonel [[Semyon Budyonny]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The Bolsheviks wanted to annex the parts of the Caucasus, including the Democratic Republic of Armenia, which were formerly part of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]]. They also saw a Turkish Republic as a buffer state or possibly a communist ally. Mustafa Kemal's official response was \"''Such questions had to be postponed until Turkish independence was achieved.''\" Having this support was important for the national movement.<ref>[[Stanford J. Shaw]]; Ezel Kural Shaw. ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey''. p. 344</ref>\n\nThe first objective was the securing of arms from abroad. They obtained these primarily from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and from Italy and France. These arms\u2014especially the Soviet weapons\u2014allowed the Turks to organize an effective army. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]] (1921) arranged the border between Turkey and the Soviet-controlled [[Transcaucasia]]n republics, while Russia itself was in a state of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and preparing to establish the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular [[Nakhchivansky Uyezd|Nakhchivan]] and [[Batumi]] were ceded to the future [[USSR]]. In return the nationalists received support and gold. For the promised resources, the nationalists had to wait until the [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August\u2013September 1921).\n\nBy providing financial and war materiel aid, the [[Bolshevik]]s aimed to heat up the war between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]] in order to delay the participation of more Allied troops in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=\"mentes\"/> At the same time the [[Bolshevik]]s attempted to export [[communism|communist]] ideologies to [[Anatolia]] and moreover supported individuals (for example: [[Mustafa Suphi]]) who were pro-[[communism]].<ref name=\"mentes\">''Belgelerle T\u00fcrk tarihi dergisi (Volumes 44-47)'', Mente\u015f Kitabevi, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lfKjT_zaFYaQ4gTaxcyfCQ&hl=de&id=C19pAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22kurtulus+savasi%22+rus+yardimi+beyaz+ordu&q=%22devam+eden+d%C3%BC%C5%9Fmanl%C4%B1ktan%22&redir_esc=y p. 87]. {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Soviet documents, Soviet financial and war materiel support between 1920 and 1922 amounted to: 39,000 [[rifle]]s, 327 [[machine gun]]s, 54 [[cannon]], 63 million rifle [[bullet]]s, 147,000 [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], 2 [[patrol boat]]s, 200.6 [[Kilogram|kg]] of gold ingots and 10.7<ref name=\"haydar2008\">Haydar \u00c7akmak: ''T\u00fcrk d\u0131\u015f politikas\u0131, 1919-2008'', Platin, 2008, {{ISBN|9944137251}}, page 126. {{in lang|tr}}</ref> million Turkish lira (which accounted for a twentieth of the Turkish budget during the war).<ref name=\"haydar2008\"/> Additionally the Soviets gave the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]] 100,000 [[Russian ruble|gold rubles]] to help build an [[orphanage]] and 20,000 [[Turkish lira|lira]] to obtain printing house equipment and [[Movie theater|cinema]] equipment.<ref>Embassy of the Russian Federation in Turkey: [http://www.turkey.mid.ru/hron/news_t_15.html ''Rusya Federasyonu\u2019nun T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti B\u00fcy\u00fckel\u00e7ili\u011fi taraf\u0131ndan yay\u0131nlanan \u2018Yeni Rusya ve Yeni T\u00fcrkiye: \u0130\u015fbirli\u011finin \u0130lk Ad\u0131mlar\u0131 (1920-1930'lu Y\u0131llarda Rus-T\u00fcrk \u0130li\u015fkileri)\u2019 ba\u015fl\u0131kl\u0131 bro\u015f\u00fcr hk.''], accessed on 4 May 2012. {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Map showing the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Western]], [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|Eastern]] and [[Franco-Turkish War|Southern]] fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.]]\n\n====East====\n{{Main|Turkish\u2013Armenian War}}\n\nThe border of the Republic of Armenia (ADR) and Ottoman Empire was defined in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (3 March 1918) after the Bolshevik revolution, and later by the Treaty of Batum (4 June 1918) with the ADR. It was obvious that after the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918) the eastern border was not going to stay as it was drawn. There were talks going on with the Armenian Diaspora and Triple Entente on reshaping the border. The Fourteen Points was seen as an incentive to the ADR, if the Armenians could prove that they were the majority of the population and that they had military control over the eastern regions. The Armenian movements on the borders were being used as an argument to redraw the border between the Ottoman Empire and the ADR. Woodrow Wilson agreed to transfer the territories back to the ADR on the principle that they were dominated by Armenians. The results of these talks were to be reflected on the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (10 August 1920). There was also a movement of Armenians from the southeast with French support. The [[Franco-Armenian Agreement (1916)|Franco-Armenian Agreement]] granted the Armenian claims to Cilicia with the establishment of the [[French Armenian Legion]]. The general idea at that time was to integrate the ADR into the French supported southeast Armenian movement. This way the ADR could gain much-sought-after resources to balance the Bolshevik expansionist movements.\n\nOne of the most important fights had taken place on this border. The very early onset of a national army was proof of this, even though there was a pressing Greek danger to the west. The stage of the eastern campaign developed through K\u00e2zim Karabekir's two reports (30 May and 4 June 1920) outlining the situation in the region. He was detailing the activities of the Armenian Republic and advising on how to shape the sources on the eastern borders, especially in Erzurum. The Russian government sent a message to settle not only the Armenian but also the Iranian border through diplomacy under Russian control. Soviet support was absolutely vital for the Turkish nationalist movement, as Turkey was underdeveloped and had no domestic armaments industry. Bakir Sami Bey was assigned to the talks. The Bolsheviks demanded that [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and Bitlis be transferred to Armenia. This was unacceptable to the Turkish revolutionaries.\n\n=====Eastern resolution=====\n{{details|Turkish\u2013Armenian War}}\nThe [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] was signed by the Ottoman Empire and was followed by the occupation of Artvin by Georgian forces on 25 July.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] (2\u20143 December 1920) was the first treaty (although illegitimate) signed by the Turkish revolutionaries. It supposed to nullify the Armenian activities on the eastern border, which was reflected in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres as a succession of regions named Wilsonian Armenia. The 10th item in the Treaty of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, which stipulated Wilsonian Armenia. The agreement was actually signed with representatives of the former government of Armenia, which by that time had no de jure or de facto power in Armenia, since Soviet rule was already established in the country.\n\nAfter the peace agreement with the Turkish nationalists, in late November, a Soviet-backed Communist uprising took place in Armenia. On 28 November 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] under the command of [[Anatoliy Gekker]] crossed over into Armenia from [[Soviet Azerbaijan]]. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted only a week. After their defeat by the Turkish revolutionaries the Armenians were no longer a threat to the Nationalist cause. It is also possible to claim that had the ADR been content with the boundaries as of 1919, it could have shown more resistance to the Bolshevik conquest, both internally and externally, but that was not how things happened.\n\nOn 16 March 1921, the Bolsheviks and Turkey signed a more comprehensive agreement, the [[Treaty of Kars]], which involved representatives of [[Soviet Armenia]], [[Soviet Azerbaijan]], and [[Soviet Georgia]].\n\nThe arms left by the defeated ADR forces were sent to the west for use against the Greeks.\n\n====West====\n[[File:KiMOiG.jpg|thumb|300px|Depicted here in a 1922 oil painting, the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna]], the [[Turkish Army]]'s entry into [[Smyrna]], now [[Izmir]] (known as the Liberation of Izmir in Turkish) on 9 September 1922, following the successful [[Great Smyrna Offensive]], effectively sealed the Turkish victory and ended the war. Smyrna was the location where [[Kuva-yi Milliye|Turkish civilian armed resistance]] against the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres|occupation of Anatolia]] by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] first began on [[Occupation of Smyrna|15 May 1919]].]]\nThe war arose because the western Allies\u2014particularly British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]\u2014had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire if Greece entered the war on the Allied side. These included parts of its ancestral homeland, Eastern Thrace, the islands of [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada), [[Tenedos]] (Bozcaada), and parts of Western Anatolia around the city of Smyrna (Izmir). Greece wanted to incorporate Constantinople to achieve the [[Megali Idea]], but Entente powers did not give permission.\n\nIt was decided by the Triple Entente that Greece would control a zone around Smyrna (Izmir) and Ayvalik in western Asia Minor. The reason for these landings were prior Italian landings on the southern coast of Turkey, including in the city of Antalya. The Allies worried about further Italian expansion and saw Greek landings as a way to avoid this.\n\nOn 28 May, Greeks landed on [[Ayval\u0131k]]. It was no surprise that this small town was chosen as this town was the Greek-speaking stronghold before the Balkan Wars. The Balkan Wars changed the nature of this region. The Muslim inhabitants who were forced out with the extending borders of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], mainly from [[Crete]], settled in this area. Under an old Ottoman Lieutenant Colonel [[Ali \u00c7etinkaya]], these people formed a unit. Along Ali \u00c7etinkaya's units, population in the region gathered around Re\u015fit, Tevfik and [[\u00c7erkes Ethem]]. These units were very determined to fight against Greece as there was no other place that they could be pushed back. Re\u015fit, Tevfik and Ethem were of [[Adyghe people|Circassian]] origin who were expelled from their ancestral lands in the Caucasus by the Russians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} They were settled around the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]]. Greek troops first met with these irregulars. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] asked Admiral [[Rauf Orbay]] if he could help in coordinating the units under Ali \u00c7etinkaya, Re\u015fit, Tevfik and \u00c7erkez Ethem. Rauf Orbay\u2014also of Circassian origin\u2014managed to link these groups. He asked them to cut the Greek logistic support lines.\n\nThe Allied decision to allow a Greek landing in Smyrna resulted from earlier Italian landings at Antalya. Faced with Italian annexation of parts of Asia Minor with a significant ethnic Greek population, Venizelos secured Allied permission for Greek troops to land in Smyrna, ostensibly in order to protect the civilian population from turmoil. Turks claim that Venizelos wanted to create a homogeneous Greek settlement to be able to annex it to Greece, and his public statements left little doubt about Greek intentions: \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to the expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>\"Not War Against Islam-Statement by Greek Prime Minister\" in ''The Scotsman'', 29 June 1920 p. 5</ref>\n\n=====Western active stage=====\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk asker\u00ee birlikleri denetlerken, \u0130zmit, 18 Haziran 1922.png|thumb|Kemal Pasha inspecting troops (18 June 1922)]]\n{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)}}\nAs soon as Greek forces landed in Smyrna, a Turkish nationalist opened fire prompting brutal reprisals. Greek forces used Smyrna as a base for launching attacks deeper into Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal refused to accept even a temporary Greek presence in Smyrna. Eventually, the Turkish nationalists with the aid of the Kemalist armed forces defeated the Greek troops and population and pushed them out of Smyrna and the rest of Anatolia.\n\n=====Western resolution=====\n[[File:Liberation of Istanbul on October 6, 1923.jpg|thumb|right|Turkish troops enter Constantinople on 6 October 1923]]\n{{Main|Chanak Crisis|Armistice of Mudanya}}\nWith the borders secured with treaties and agreements at east and south, Mustafa Kemal was now in a commanding position. The Nationalists were then able to demand on 5 September 1922 that the Greeks{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<!-- Greek military or Greek civilian population? --> evacuate East Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos as well as Asia Minor, and the [[Maritsa]] (''Turkish'' Meri\u00e7) River should again become the western border of Turkey, as before 1914. The British were prepared to defend the neutral zone of Constantinople and the Straits and the French asked Kemal to respect it,<ref>Harry J. Psomiades, ''The Eastern Question, the Last Phase: a Study in Greek-Turkish Diplomacy'' (Pella, New York 2000), 33.</ref> to which he agreed on 28 September.<ref>A. L.

In return, on 29 September Kemal asked for the negotiations to be started at [[Mudanya]]. Negotiations at Mudanya began on 3 October and it was concluded with the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. This was agreed on 11 October, two hours before the British intended to engage at [[Chanak]], and signed the next day. The Greeks initially refused to agree but did so on 13 October.<ref>Psomiades, 35.</ref> Factors persuading Turkey to sign may have included the arrival of British reinforcements.<ref>Macfie, 336.</ref>\n\nThe armistice then made it possible for the allies to recognise the Turkish claim to East Thrace, which was agreed to at the Lausanne Conference on 20 November 1922.<ref>Macfie, 341.</ref>\n\n====South====\n[[File:Kuvai-milliye-Millitias-from Turkish wikipedia.png|thumb|Turkish nationalist militias in Cilicia]]\n{{Main|Franco-Turkish War}}\n\nThe French wanted to take control of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. With pressure against the French, [[Cilicia]] would be easily left to the nationalists. The [[Taurus Mountains]] were critical to the Ankara government. The French soldiers were foreign to the region and they were using Armenian militia to acquire their intelligence. Turkish nationals had been in cooperation with Arab tribes in this area. Compared to the Greek threat, they were the second most dangerous for the Ankara government. He proposed that if the Greek threat could be dispersed, the French would not resist.\n\n===Conference of London===\n{{Details|Conference of London}}\n\nIn salvaging the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, The Triple Entente forced the Turkish Revolutionaries to agree with the terms through a series of conferences in London. The Conference of London, with sharp differences, failed in both the first stage and the second stages. The modified S\u00e8vres of the conference as a peace settlement was incompatible with the [[Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee|National Pact]].\n\nThe conference of London gave the Triple Entente an opportunity to reverse some of its policies. In October, parties to the conference received a report from Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol. He organized a commission to analyze the situation, and inquire into the bloodshed during the Occupation of Izmir and the following activities in the region. The commission reported that if annexation would not follow, Greece should not be the only occupation force in this area. Admiral Bristol was not so sure how to explain this annexation to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson as he insisted on \"respect for nationalities\" in the Fourteen Points. He believed that the sentiments of the Turks \"will never accept this annexation\".\n\nNeither the Conference of London nor Admiral [[Mark Lambert Bristol]]'s report changed British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s position. On 12 February 1921, he went with the annexation of the Aegean coast which was followed by the Greek offensive. David Lloyd George acted with his sentiments, which were developed during [[Gallipoli campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]], as opposed to [[George Milner (British Army officer)|General Milne]], who was his officer on the ground.\n\n==Peace negotiations==\n[[File:Turkije verjaagt Griekenland In Klein-Azi\u00eb (titel op object), NG-505-108.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon: Greek king Constantine runs away from the bomb which reads \"KEMAL\"]]\nFirst negotiations between the sides failed during the Conference of London. The stage for peace was set after the Triple Entente's decision to make an arrangement with the Turkish revolutionaries. Before the talks with the Entente, the nationalists partially settled their eastern borders with the Democratic Republic of Armenia, signing Treaty of Alexandropol, but changes in the Caucasus\u2014especially the establishment of the Armenian SSR\u2014required one more round of talks. The outcome was the Treaty of Kars, a successor treaty to the earlier [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] of March 1921. It was signed in [[Kars]] with the Russian SFSR on 13 October 1921<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=24 April 2007 }}</ref> and ratified in Yerevan on 11 September 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groong.usc.edu/treaties/kars.html|title=ANN/Groong -- Treaty of Berlin - 07/13/1878|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Armistice of Mudanya===\n{{Details|Armistice of Mudanya}}\n\nThe Marmara sea resort town of Mudanya hosted the conference to arrange the armistice on 3 October 1922. \u0130smet (\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc)\u2014commander of the western armies\u2014was in front of the Allies. The scene was unlike Mondros as the British and the Greeks were on the defense. Greece was represented by the Allies.\n\nThe British still expected the GNA to make concessions. From the first speech, the British were startled as Ankara demanded fulfillment of the National Pact. During the conference, the British troops in Constantinople were preparing for a Kemalist attack. There was never any fighting in Thrace, as Greek units withdrew before the Turks crossed the straits from Asia Minor. The only concession that Ismet made to the British was an agreement that his troops would not advance any farther toward the Dardanelles, which gave a safe haven for the British troops as long as the conference continued. The conference dragged on far beyond the original expectations. In the end, it was the British who yielded to Ankara's advances.\n\nThe Armistice of Mudanya was signed on 11 October. By its terms, the Greek army would move west of the Maritsa, clearing Eastern Thrace to the Allies. The famous American author Ernest Hemingway was in Thrace at the time, and he covered the evacuation of Eastern Thrace of its Greek population. He has several short stories written about Thrace and Smyrna, which appear in his book ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]''. The agreement came into force starting 15 October. Allied forces would stay in Eastern Thrace for a month to assure law and order. In return, Ankara would recognize continued British occupation of Constantinople and the Straits zones until the final treaty was signed.\n\nRefet Bele was assigned to seize control of Eastern Thrace from the Allies. He was the first representative to reach the old capital. The British did not allow the hundred gendarmes who came with him. That resistance lasted until the next day.\n\n===Abolition of the sultanate===\n{{Main|Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate}}\nKemal had long ago made up his mind to abolish the sultanate when the moment was ripe. After facing opposition from some members of the assembly, using his influence as a war hero, he managed to prepare a draft law for the abolition of the sultanate, which was then submitted to the National Assembly for voting. In that article, it was stated that the form of the government in Constantinople, resting on the sovereignty of an individual, had already ceased to exist when the British forces occupied the city after World War I.<ref name=\"Kinross, p. 348\">Kinross, ''Rebirth of a Nation'', p. 348</ref> Furthermore, it was argued that although the [[caliphate]] had belonged to the Ottoman Empire, it rested on the Turkish state by its dissolution and Turkish National Assembly would have right to choose a member of the Ottoman family in the office of caliph. On 1 November, The Turkish Grand Assembly voted for the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate. The last Sultan left Turkey on 17 November 1922, in a British battleship on his way to Malta. Such was the last act in the [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire]].\n\n===Conference of Lausanne===\n{{details|Lausanne Conference of 1922\u201323}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of the Ottoman Empire according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nThe [[Lausanne Conference of 1922\u201323|Conference of Lausanne]] began on 21 November 1922 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] and lasted into 1923. Its purpose was the negotiation of a [[treaty]] to replace the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], which, under the new government of the Grand National Assembly, was no longer recognised by [[Turkey]]. [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was the leading Turkish negotiator. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc maintained the basic position of the Ankara government that it had to be treated as an independent and sovereign state, equal with all other states attending the conference. In accordance with the directives of Mustafa Kemal, while discussing matters regarding the control of Turkish finances and justice, the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]], the [[Turkish Straits]] and the like, he refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty.<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 365</ref> Finally, after long debates, on 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed. Ten weeks after the signature the Allied forces left Istanbul.<ref>Kinross, Atat\u00fcrk, ''The Rebirth of a Nation'', 373.</ref>\n\nThe conference opened with representatives from the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and Turkey. It heard speeches from [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy and [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] of France. At its conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the \"freedom of the [[Dardanelles|straits]]\", which was Britain's main concern. The matter of the status of [[Mosul]] was deferred, since [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] refused to be budged on the British position that the area was part of [[Iraq]]. The British Iraq Mandate's possession of Mosul was confirmed by a League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain in 1926. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of their goals and on 30 January 1923 issued a statement that they did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a \"basis of discussion\". The Turks therefore refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to Ismet Pasha to sign, and when he refused the Foreign Secretary broke off negotiations and left that night on the [[Orient Express]].\n\n===Treaty of Lausanne===\n{{Main|Treaty of Lausanne (1923)}}\n\nThe Treaty of Lausanne, finally signed in July 1923, led to international recognition of the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Turkey]] as the [[successor state]] to the defunct [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne|title=Treaty of Lausanne - World War I Document Archive|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the Republic===\n[[File:Memory of Victory, 1925.jpg|thumb|200px|''Hat\u0131ra-i Zafer'' (Memory of Victory) by Hasan Sabri in 1925.]]\n\nA republic was [[Republic Day (Turkey)|proclaimed on 29 October 1923]], in the new capital of Ankara.

France expected to exercise control over Hatay, Lebanon and Syria, and also wanted control over a portion of southeastern Anatolia based on the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]]. France signed the [[Franco-Armenian Agreement (1916)|Franco-Armenian Agreement]] and promised the realization of an Armenian state in the Mediterranean region in exchange to the [[French Armenian Legion]].<ref>[[Richard G. Hovannisian]], ''Armenia on the Road to Independence'', 1967.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Allied countries continued to lay claim to portions of the quickly crumbling Ottoman Empire. British forces based in Syria occupied [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Mara\u015f]], [[Urfa]] and [[Birecik]], while French forces embarked by [[gunboat]]s and sent troops to the [[Black Sea]] ports of [[Zonguldak]] and [[Karadeniz Ere\u011fli]] commanding Turkey's coal mining region. At the Paris Peace Conference, competing claims of [[Anatolia|Western Anatolia]] by Greek and Italian delegations led Greece to land the flagship of the [[Greek Navy]] at [[Smyrna]], resulting in the Italian delegation walking out of the peace talks. On 30 April, Italy responded to the possible idea of Greek incorporation of Western Anatolia by also sending a warship to Smyrna (Izmir) as a show of force against the Greek campaign. A large Italian force also landed in [[Antalya]]. With the Italian delegation absent from the Paris Peace talks, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] was able to sway [[French Third Republic|France]] in favour of Greece and ultimately the Conference authorized the landing of Greek troops on Anatolian territory.\n\nThe Greek campaign of Western Anatolia began on 15 May 1919, as Greek troops began landing in Smyrna. For the city's Muslim population, the day is marked by the \"first bullet\" fired by [[Hasan Tahsin]]<ref group=note>Mehmet \u00c7avu\u015f's fire against the French in D\u00f6rtyol was misknown until near past. But Hasan Tahsin's firing was the first bullet in West Front</ref> at the Greek standard bearer at the head of the troops, the murder by bayonet coups of [[Colonel|Miralay]] Fethi Bey for refusing to shout \"Zito [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]\" (meaning \"long live Venizelos\") and the killing and wounding of unarmed Turkish soldiers in the city's principal [[casern]], as well as of 300\u2013400 civilians. Greek troops moved from Smyrna outwards to towns on the Karaburun peninsula, to [[Sel\u00e7uk]], situated a hundred kilometers south of Smyrna at a key location that commands the fertile [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes River]] valley, and to [[Menemen]] towards the north.\n\n==Initial organization==\n[[File:Turkey and Turkish people during War of Independence.ogg|thumb|Anatolia in 1919]]\n\n''Fahr\u00ee Y\u00e2ver-i Hazret-i \u015eehriy\u00e2ri'' (\"Honorary ''Aide-de-camp'' to His Majesty Sultan\") [[Mirliva]] Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa was assigned as the inspector of the [[Ninth Army (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|9th Army Troops Inspectorate]] to reorganize what remained of the Ottoman military units and to improve internal security on 30 April 1919.<ref>Andrew Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', John Murray, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6592-2}}, p. 214.</ref> According to [[Lord Kinross]], through manipulation and the help of friends and sympathizers, Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa became the Inspector of virtually all of the Ottoman forces in Anatolia, tasked with overseeing the disbanding process of the remaining Ottoman forces.<ref>Lord Kinross.

''The Rebirth of a Nation'', chap 19.</ref>\n\nResistance to Allied demands began at the very onset of the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I. Many Ottoman officials organized the secret [[Sentinel Association]] ({{lang-tr|Karakol Cemiyeti}}) in reaction to the policies of the Allies. The objective of the Sentinel Association was to thwart Allied demands through passive and active resistance. Many Ottoman officials participated in efforts to conceal from the occupying authorities details of the burgeoning independence movement spreading throughout Anatolia. Munitions initially seized by the Allies were secretly smuggled out of Constantinople into Central Anatolia, along with Ottoman officers keen to resist any division of Ottoman territories. [[Mirliva]] [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy|Ali Fuad Pa\u015fa]] in the meantime had moved his [[XX Corps (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|XX Corps]] from Ere\u011fli to Ankara and started organizing resistance groups, including [[Circassians|Circassian]] immigrants under [[\u00c7erkes Ethem]].\n\nSince the southern rim of Anatolia{{Where|date=July 2011}} was effectively controlled by British warships and competing Greek and Italian troops, the Turkish National Movement's headquarters moved to the rugged terrain of central Anatolia. The reasons for these new assignments is still a matter of debate; one view is that it was an intentional move to support the national movement, another was that the Sultan wanted to keep Constantinople under his control, a goal which was in total agreement with the aims of the occupation armies which could keep the Sultan under control. The most prominent idea given for the Sultan's decision was by assigning these officers out of the capital, the Sultan was trying to minimize the effectiveness of these soldiers in the capital. The Sultan was cited as saying that without an organized army, the Allies could not be defeated, and the national movement had two army corps in May 1919,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} one was the XX Corps based in Ankara under the command of Ali Fuat Pa\u015fa and the other was [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|XV Corps]] based in [[Erzurum]] under the command of [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir|K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir Pa\u015fa]].\n\nMustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa and his colleagues stepped ashore on 19 May and set up their first quarters in the Mintika Palace Hotel. Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa made the people of Samsun aware of the Greek and Italian landings, staged mass meetings (while remaining discreet) and made, thanks to the excellent telegraph network, fast connections with the army units in Anatolia and began to form links with various nationalist groups. He sent telegrams of protest to foreign embassies and the War Ministry about British reinforcements in the area and about British aid to Greek brigand gangs. After a week in Samsun, Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa and his staff moved to [[Havza]], about {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland.\n\nMustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa writes in his memoir{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} that he needed nationwide support. The importance of his position, and his status as the \"Hero of Anafartalar\" after the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], and his title of Fahri Yaver-i Hazret-i \u015eehriyari (\"Honorary Aide-de-camp to His Majesty Sultan\") gave him some credentials. On the other hand, this was not enough to inspire everyone. While officially occupied with the disarming of the army, he had increased his various contacts in order to build his movement's momentum. He met with Rauf Bey (Orbay), Ali Fuat Pa\u015fa (Cebesoy), and Refet Bey (Bele) on 21 June 1919 and declared the [[Amasya Circular]] (22 June 1919).\n\n===Decoding national movement===\n[[File:Hal\u00e2sk\u00e2r\u00e2n-\u0131 \u0130sl\u00e2m afi\u015f.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster of the [[Turkish National Movement]]]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal Pa\u015fa, Erzurum, 5 Temmuz 1919.png|thumb|Mustafa Kemal and his colleagues in [[Erzurum Congress|Erzurum]] (5 July 1919)]]\nOn 23 June, High Commissioner [[Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe|Admiral Calthorpe]], realizing the significance of Mustafa Kemal's discreet activities in Anatolia, sent a report about Mustafa Kemal to the Foreign Office. His remarks were downplayed by George Kidson of the Eastern Department. Captain Hurst (British army) in Samsun warned Admiral Calthorpe one more time, but Hurst's units were replaced with the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]. The movement of British units alarmed the population of the region and convinced the population that Mustafa Kemal was right.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Right after this \"The Association for Defense of National Rights\" (M\u00fcdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti) was founded in Trabzon, and a parallel association in Samsun was also founded, which declared that the Black Sea region was not safe. The same activities that happened in Smyrna were happening in the region. When the British landed in [[Alexandretta]], Admiral Calthorpe resigned on the basis that this was against the Armistice that he had signed and was assigned to another position on 5 August 1919.<ref>Lord Kinross. (1999) ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Re-birth of a Nation'', chap. 16.</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Mustafa Kemal Pasha received a telegram from the Sultan. The Sultan asked him to cease his activities in Anatolia and return to the capital. Mustafa Kemal was in Erzincan and did not want to return to Constantinople, concerned that the foreign authorities might have designs for him beyond the Sultan's plans. He felt the best course for him was to take a two-month leave of absence.\n\nThe Representative committee was established at the [[Sivas Congress]] (4\u201311 September 1919).\n\n===Representational problem===\nOn 16 October 1919, [[Ali R\u0131za Pasha]] sent a navy minister, Hulusi Salih Pasha, to negotiate with the Turkish National Movement. Hulusi Salih Pasha was not part of World War I. Salih Pasha and Mustafa Kemal met in Amasya. Mustafa Kemal put the representational problems of Ottoman Parliament on the agenda. He wanted to have a signed protocol between Ali R\u0131za Pasha and the \"representative committee.\" On the advice of the British, Ali R\u0131za Pasha rejected any form of recognition or legitimacy claims by this unconstitutional political formation in Anatolia.\n\nIn December 1919, fresh elections were held for the Ottoman parliament. This was an attempt to build a better representative structure. The Ottoman parliament was seen as a way to reassert the central government's claims of legitimacy in response to the emerging nationalist movement in Anatolia. In the meantime, groups of Ottoman Greeks had formed Greek nationalist militias within Ottoman borders and were acting on their own. Greek members of the Ottoman parliament repeatedly blocked any progress in the parliament, and most Greek subjects of the Sultan boycotted the new elections.\n\nThe elections were held and a new parliament of the Ottoman State was formed under the occupation. However, Ali R\u0131za Pasha was too hasty in thinking that his parliament could bring him legitimacy. The house of the parliament was under the shadow of the British battalion stationed at Constantinople. Any decisions by the parliament had to have the signatures of both Ali R\u0131za Pasha and the commanding British Officer. The freedom of the new government was limited. It did not take too long for the members of parliament to recognize that any kind of integrity was not possible in this situation. Ali R\u0131za Pasha and his government had become the voice of the Triple Entente. The only laws that passed were those acceptable to, or specifically ordered by the British.\n\n===Last Ottoman Parliament===\n[[File:Mudanya July 1920 (1).jpg|thumb|Fire caused by the British bombardment in [[Mudanya]] (6 July 1920)]]\n\nOn 12 January 1920, the last Ottoman Chamber of Deputies met in the capital. First the Sultan's speech was presented and then a telegram from Mustafa Kemal, manifesting the claim that the rightful government of Turkey{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} being in Ankara in the name of the Representative Committee.\n\nA group called ''Fel\u00e2h-\u0131 Vatan'' among the Ottoman parliament worked to acknowledge the decisions taken at the [[Erzurum Congress]] and the [[Sivas Congress]]. The British began to sense that a Turkish Nationalist movement had been flourishing, a movement with goals against English interests. The Ottoman government was not doing all that it could to suppress the nationalists. On 28 January the deputies met secretly. Proposals were made to elect Mustafa Kemal president of the Chamber, but this was deferred in the certain knowledge that the British would prorogue the Chamber{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} before it could do what had been planned all along, namely accept the declaration of the Sivas Congress.\n\nOn 28 January, the Ottoman parliament developed the National Pact (Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee) and published it on 12 February. This pact adopted six principles, which called for self-determination, the security of Constantinople, and the opening of the Straits, also the abolition of the capitulations. In effect the Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee solidified a lot of nationalist notions, which were in conflict with the Allied plans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Shift from ''de facto'' to ''de jure'' occupation===\nThe National Movement\u2014which persuaded the Ottoman [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]] to declare a \"National Pact\" (''[[Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee]]'') against the occupying Allies\u2013prompted the British government to take action. To put an end to Turkish Nationalist hopes, the British decided to systematically bring Turkey under their control. The plan was to dismantle Turkish Government organizations, beginning in Istanbul and moving deep into Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal's National Movement was seen as the main problem. The British Foreign Office was asked to devise a plan. The Foreign Office suggested the same plan previously used during the [[Arab Revolt]]. This time however, resources were channeled to warlords like [[Ahmet Anzavur]]. The politics of this decision were legitimised via the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Anatolia was to be westernized under Christian governments. That was the only way that Christians could be safe, said the British government. The Treaty of S\u00e8vres placed most of Anatolia under Christian control. This policy aimed to break down authority in Anatolia by separating the Sultan, its government, and pitting Christians (Greece and [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], Armenians of Cilicia) against Muslims.\n\nOn the night of 15 March, British troops began to occupy key buildings and arrest Turkish nationalists. It was a very messy operation. At the military music school there was resistance. At least ten students died but the official death toll is unknown even today. The British tried to capture the leadership of the movement. They secured the departments of the Minister of War and of the Chief of the General Staff, Fevzi \u00c7akmak. \u00c7akmak was an able and relatively conservative officer who was known as one of the army's oldest field commanders. He soon became one of the principal military leaders of the National Movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Newspaper-the gray river march 18 1920.png|thumb|150px|A part from a newspaper published on 18 March 1920 (The Gray River Argus, New Zealand)]]\n\nMustafa Kemal was ready for this move. He warned all the nationalist organizations that there would be misleading declarations from the capital. He warned that the only way to stop the British was to organize protests. He said \"Today the Turkish nation is called to defend its capacity for civilization, its right to life and independence{{spaced ndash}}its entire future\". Mustafa Kemal was extensively familiar with the Arab Revolt and British involvement. He managed to stay one step ahead of the British Foreign Office. This\u2014as well as his other abilities\u2014gave Mustafa Kemal considerable authority among the revolutionaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOn 18 March the Ottoman parliament sent a protest to the Allies. The document stated that it was unacceptable to arrest five of its members. But the damage had been done. It was end of the Ottoman political system. This show of force by the British had left the Sultan as sole controller of the Empire. But the Sultan depended on their power to keep what was left of the empire. He was now a puppet of the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Jurisdictional conflict==\nThe new government\u2014hoping to undermine the National Movement\u2014passed a ''[[fatwa]]'' (legal opinion) from \u015eeyh\u00fclislam to qualify the Turkish revolutionaries as infidels, calling for the death of its leaders.<ref name=Ardic>{{cite book|last1=Ardic|first1=Nurullah|title=Islam and the Politics of Secularism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZAXNxxkJKYsC&pg=PA251&dq=fatwa+of+ankara#v=onepage&q=fatwa%20of%20ankara&f=false|accessdate=21 August 2014|isbn=9781136489846|date=21 August 2012}}</ref> The ''fatwa'' stated that true believers should not go along with the nationalist (rebels) movement. Along with this religious decree, the government sentenced Mustafa Kemal and prominent nationalists to death in absentia. At the same time, the m\u00fcfti of Ankara Rifat B\u00f6rek\u00e7i in defense of the nationalist movement, issued a counteracting fatwa declaring that the capital was under the control of the Entente and the Ferit Pasha government.<ref name=Vahide>{{cite book|last1=Vahide|first1=Sukran|title=Islam in Modern Turkey|date=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791482971|pages=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdX-iggjrxwC&pg=PA140&dq=fatwa+of+ankara#v=onepage&q=fatwa%20of%20ankara&f=false|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> In this text, the nationalist movement's goal was stated as freeing the sultanate and the caliphate from its enemies.\n\n===Dissolution of the Ottoman parliament===\nMustafa Kemal expected the Allies neither to accept the Harbord report nor to respect his parliamentary immunity if he went to the Ottoman capital, hence he remained in Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal moved the Representative Committee's capital from Erzurum to Ankara so that he could keep in touch with as many deputies as possible as they traveled to Constantinople to attend the parliament. He also started a newspaper, the ''Hakimiyet-i Milliye'' (''National Sovereignty''), to speak for the movement both in Turkey and the outside world (10 January 1920).\n\nMustafa Kemal declared that the only legal government of Turkey was the Representative Committee in Ankara and that all civilian and military officials were to obey it rather than the government in Constantinople. This argument gained very strong support, as by that time the Ottoman Parliament was fully under Allied control.\n\n===Promulgation of the Grand National Assembly===\nThe strong measures taken against the nationalists by the Ottoman government created a distinct new phase. Mustafa Kemal sent a note to the governors and force commanders, asking them to implement the election of delegates to join the GNA, which would convene in Ankara. Mustafa Kemal appealed to the Islamic world, asking for help to make sure that everyone knew he was still fighting in the name of the sultan who was also the caliph. He stated he wanted to free the caliph from the Allies. Plans were made to organize a new government and parliament in Ankara, and then ask the sultan to accept its authority.\n\nA flood of supporters moved to Ankara just ahead of the Allied dragnets. Included among them were [[Halide Edip]], Adnan (Ad\u0131var), \u0130smet (\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc), Mustafa Kemal's important allies in the Ministry of War, and Celaleddin Arif, the president of the Chamber of Deputies. [[Yunus Nadi Abal\u0131o\u011flu|Yunus Nadi]] (Abal\u0131o\u011flu), the owner of ''Yeni G\u00fcn'' newspaper, journalist-author and deputy of Izmir, Halide Edip (Ad\u0131var) met in Geyve on 31 March. Two intellectuals discussed the necessity that a news agency should be established to counter the allied occupation administration's censure over the news. They chose ''Anadolu'' as the name. Mustafa Kemal, whom they meet in Ankara, immediately launched initiatives to herald the establishment of the [[Anadolu Agency]].<ref name=\"nationalnewsagency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/tarihce_en/|title=History of Anadolu Agency|accessdate=16 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109132901/http://www.aa.com.tr/tarihce_en/|archivedate=9 January 2008}}</ref> Mustafa Kemal wanted to transmit news stories to the world. Kemal also stressed the importance of making the national struggle heard inside and outside of the country.<ref name=\"nationalnewsagency\"/> Celaleddin Arif's desertion of the capital was of great significance. Celaleddin Arif stated that the Ottoman Parliament had been dissolved illegally. The Armistice did not give Allies the power to dissolve the Ottoman Parliament and the Constitution of 1909 had also removed the Sultan's power to do so, to prevent what Abd\u00fclhamid did in 1879.\n\nSome 100 members of the Ottoman Parliament were able to escape the Allied roundup and joined 190 deputies elected around the country by the national resistance group. Ismet Inon\u00fc joined as a deputy from Edirne. In March 1920, Turkish revolutionaries announced that the Turkish nation was establishing its own Parliament in Ankara under the name [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] (GNA). The GNA assumed full governmental powers. On 23 April, the new Assembly gathered for the first time, making Mustafa Kemal its first president and Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc chief of the General Staff. The new regime's determination to revolt against the government in the capital and not the Sultan was quickly made evident. By 3 May 1920, a [[Turkish Provisional Government]] was also formed in [[Ankara]].\n\n===Early pressure on nationalist militias===\n[[File:Turkish revolutionaries-Kuvva-i Milliye.ogg|thumb|[[Kuva-yi Milliye]]]]\n\n{{Main|Revolts during the Turkish War of Independence}}\n\nAnatolia had many competing forces on its soil: British battalions, Ahmet Anzavur forces, and the Sultan's army. The Sultan gave 4,000 soldiers from his [[Kuva-i Inzibatiye]] (Caliphate Army) to resist against the nationalists. Then using money from the Allies, he raised another army, a force about 2,000 strong from non-Muslim inhabitants which were initially deployed in Iznik. The Sultan's government sent forces under the name of the caliphate army to the revolutionaries and aroused counterrevolutionary outbreaks.<ref>George F. Nafziger, ''Islam at War: A History'', p. 132.</ref>\n\nThe British being skeptical of how formidable these insurgents were, decided to use irregular power to counteract this rebellion. The nationalist forces were distributed all around Turkey, so many small units were dispatched to face them. In Izmit there were two battalions of the British army. Their commanders were living on the Ottoman warship ''Yavuz''. These units were to be used to rout the partisans under the command of Ali Fuat Cebesoy and Refet Bele.\n\nOn 13 April 1920, the first conflict occurred at D\u00fczce as a direct consequence of the sheik ul-Islam's ''fatwa''. On 18 April 1920, the D\u00fczce conflict was extended to Bolu; on 20 April 1920, it extended to Gerede. The movement engulfed an important part of northwestern Anatolia for about a month. The Ottoman government had accorded semi-official status to the \"Kuva-i Inzibatiye\" and Ahmet Anzavur held an important role in the uprising. Both sides faced each other in a pitched battle near Izmit on 14 June. Ahmet Anzavur's forces and British units outnumbered the militias. Yet under heavy attack some of the Kuva-i Inzibatiye deserted and joined the opposing ranks. This revealed the Sultan did not have the unwavering support of his men. Meanwhile, the rest of these forces withdrew behind the British lines which held their position.\n[[File:Execution of a Kemalist Turk in Izmit 1920.jpg|thumb|300px|Execution of a Kemalist Turk by the British forces in Izmit. (1920)]]\n\nThe clash outside Izmit brought serious consequences. The British forces opened fire on the nationalists and bombed them from the air. This bombing forced a retreat but there was a panic in Constantinople. The British commander\u2014General [[George Milne, 1st Baron Milne|George Milne]]\u2014asked for reinforcements. This led to a study to determine what would be required to defeat the Turkish nationalists. The report\u2014signed by Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch\u2014concluded that 27 divisions would be sufficient, but the British army did not have 27 divisions to spare. Also, a deployment of this size could have disastrous political consequences back home. World War I had just ended, and the British public would not support another lengthy and costly expedition.\n\nThe British accepted the fact that a nationalist movement could not be faced without deployment of consistent and well-trained forces. On 25 June, the forces originating from Kuva-i Inzibatiye were dismantled under British supervision. The official stance was that there was no use for them. The British realized that the best option to overcome these Turkish nationalists was to use a force that was battle-tested and fierce enough to fight the Turks on their own soil. The British had to look no further than Turkey's neighbor: Greece.\n\n===Establishment of the army===\nBefore the Amasya Circular (22 June 1919), Mustafa Kemal met with a Bolshevik delegation headed by Colonel [[Semyon Budyonny]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The Bolsheviks wanted to annex the parts of the Caucasus, including the Democratic Republic of Armenia, which were formerly part of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]]. They also saw a Turkish Republic as a buffer state or possibly a communist ally. Mustafa Kemal's official response was \"''Such questions had to be postponed until Turkish independence was achieved.''\" Having this support was important for the national movement.<ref>[[Stanford J. Shaw]]; Ezel Kural Shaw. ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey''. p. 344</ref>\n\nThe first objective was the securing of arms from abroad. They obtained these primarily from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and from Italy and France. These arms\u2014especially the Soviet weapons\u2014allowed the Turks to organize an effective army. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]] (1921) arranged the border between Turkey and the Soviet-controlled [[Transcaucasia]]n republics, while Russia itself was in a state of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and preparing to establish the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular [[Nakhchivansky Uyezd|Nakhchivan]] and [[Batumi]] were ceded to the future [[USSR]]. In return the nationalists received support and gold. For the promised resources, the nationalists had to wait until the [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August\u2013September 1921).\n\nBy providing financial and war materiel aid, the [[Bolshevik]]s aimed to heat up the war between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]] in order to delay the participation of more Allied troops in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=\"mentes\"/> At the same time the [[Bolshevik]]s attempted to export [[communism|communist]] ideologies to [[Anatolia]] and moreover supported individuals (for example: [[Mustafa Suphi]]) who were pro-[[communism]].<ref name=\"mentes\">''Belgelerle T\u00fcrk tarihi dergisi (Volumes 44-47)'', Mente\u015f Kitabevi, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lfKjT_zaFYaQ4gTaxcyfCQ&hl=de&id=C19pAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22kurtulus+savasi%22+rus+yardimi+beyaz+ordu&q=%22devam+eden+d%C3%BC%C5%9Fmanl%C4%B1ktan%22&redir_esc=y p. 87]. {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Soviet documents, Soviet financial and war materiel support between 1920 and 1922 amounted to: 39,000 [[rifle]]s, 327 [[machine gun]]s, 54 [[cannon]], 63 million rifle [[bullet]]s, 147,000 [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], 2 [[patrol boat]]s, 200.6 [[Kilogram|kg]] of gold ingots and 10.7<ref name=\"haydar2008\">Haydar \u00c7akmak: ''T\u00fcrk d\u0131\u015f politikas\u0131, 1919-2008'', Platin, 2008, {{ISBN|9944137251}}, page 126. {{in lang|tr}}</ref> million Turkish lira (which accounted for a twentieth of the Turkish budget during the war).<ref name=\"haydar2008\"/> Additionally the Soviets gave the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]] 100,000 [[Russian ruble|gold rubles]] to help build an [[orphanage]] and 20,000 [[Turkish lira|lira]] to obtain printing house equipment and [[Movie theater|cinema]] equipment.<ref>Embassy of the Russian Federation in Turkey: [http://www.turkey.mid.ru/hron/news_t_15.html ''Rusya Federasyonu\u2019nun T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti B\u00fcy\u00fckel\u00e7ili\u011fi taraf\u0131ndan yay\u0131nlanan \u2018Yeni Rusya ve Yeni T\u00fcrkiye: \u0130\u015fbirli\u011finin \u0130lk Ad\u0131mlar\u0131 (1920-1930'lu Y\u0131llarda Rus-T\u00fcrk \u0130li\u015fkileri)\u2019 ba\u015fl\u0131kl\u0131 bro\u015f\u00fcr hk.''], accessed on 4 May 2012. {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Map showing the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Western]], [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|Eastern]] and [[Franco-Turkish War|Southern]] fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.]]\n\n====East====\n{{Main|Turkish\u2013Armenian War}}\n\nThe border of the Republic of Armenia (ADR) and Ottoman Empire was defined in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (3 March 1918) after the Bolshevik revolution, and later by the Treaty of Batum (4 June 1918) with the ADR. It was obvious that after the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918) the eastern border was not going to stay as it was drawn. There were talks going on with the Armenian Diaspora and Triple Entente on reshaping the border. The Fourteen Points was seen as an incentive to the ADR, if the Armenians could prove that they were the majority of the population and that they had military control over the eastern regions. The Armenian movements on the borders were being used as an argument to redraw the border between the Ottoman Empire and the ADR. Woodrow Wilson agreed to transfer the territories back to the ADR on the principle that they were dominated by Armenians. The results of these talks were to be reflected on the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (10 August 1920). There was also a movement of Armenians from the southeast with French support. The [[Franco-Armenian Agreement (1916)|Franco-Armenian Agreement]] granted the Armenian claims to Cilicia with the establishment of the [[French Armenian Legion]]. The general idea at that time was to integrate the ADR into the French supported southeast Armenian movement. This way the ADR could gain much-sought-after resources to balance the Bolshevik expansionist movements.\n\nOne of the most important fights had taken place on this border. The very early onset of a national army was proof of this, even though there was a pressing Greek danger to the west. The stage of the eastern campaign developed through K\u00e2zim Karabekir's two reports (30 May and 4 June 1920) outlining the situation in the region. He was detailing the activities of the Armenian Republic and advising on how to shape the sources on the eastern borders, especially in Erzurum. The Russian government sent a message to settle not only the Armenian but also the Iranian border through diplomacy under Russian control. Soviet support was absolutely vital for the Turkish nationalist movement, as Turkey was underdeveloped and had no domestic armaments industry. Bakir Sami Bey was assigned to the talks. The Bolsheviks demanded that [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and Bitlis be transferred to Armenia. This was unacceptable to the Turkish revolutionaries.\n\n=====Eastern resolution=====\n{{details|Turkish\u2013Armenian War}}\nThe [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] was signed by the Ottoman Empire and was followed by the occupation of Artvin by Georgian forces on 25 July.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] (2\u20143 December 1920) was the first treaty (although illegitimate) signed by the Turkish revolutionaries. It supposed to nullify the Armenian activities on the eastern border, which was reflected in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres as a succession of regions named Wilsonian Armenia. The 10th item in the Treaty of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, which stipulated Wilsonian Armenia. The agreement was actually signed with representatives of the former government of Armenia, which by that time had no de jure or de facto power in Armenia, since Soviet rule was already established in the country.\n\nAfter the peace agreement with the Turkish nationalists, in late November, a Soviet-backed Communist uprising took place in Armenia. On 28 November 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] under the command of [[Anatoliy Gekker]] crossed over into Armenia from [[Soviet Azerbaijan]]. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted only a week. After their defeat by the Turkish revolutionaries the Armenians were no longer a threat to the Nationalist cause. It is also possible to claim that had the ADR been content with the boundaries as of 1919, it could have shown more resistance to the Bolshevik conquest, both internally and externally, but that was not how things happened.\n\nOn 16 March 1921, the Bolsheviks and Turkey signed a more comprehensive agreement, the [[Treaty of Kars]], which involved representatives of [[Soviet Armenia]], [[Soviet Azerbaijan]], and [[Soviet Georgia]].\n\nThe arms left by the defeated ADR forces were sent to the west for use against the Greeks.\n\n====West====\n[[File:KiMOiG.jpg|thumb|300px|Depicted here in a 1922 oil painting, the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna]], the [[Turkish Army]]'s entry into [[Smyrna]], now [[Izmir]] (known as the Liberation of Izmir in Turkish) on 9 September 1922, following the successful [[Great Smyrna Offensive]], effectively sealed the Turkish victory and ended the war. Smyrna was the location where [[Kuva-yi Milliye|Turkish civilian armed resistance]] against the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres|occupation of Anatolia]] by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] first began on [[Occupation of Smyrna|15 May 1919]].]]\nThe war arose because the western Allies\u2014particularly British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]\u2014had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire if Greece entered the war on the Allied side. These included parts of its ancestral homeland, Eastern Thrace, the islands of [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada), [[Tenedos]] (Bozcaada), and parts of Western Anatolia around the city of Smyrna (Izmir). Greece wanted to incorporate Constantinople to achieve the [[Megali Idea]], but Entente powers did not give permission.\n\nIt was decided by the Triple Entente that Greece would control a zone around Smyrna (Izmir) and Ayvalik in western Asia Minor. The reason for these landings were prior Italian landings on the southern coast of Turkey, including in the city of Antalya. The Allies worried about further Italian expansion and saw Greek landings as a way to avoid this.\n\nOn 28 May, Greeks landed on [[Ayval\u0131k]]. It was no surprise that this small town was chosen as this town was the Greek-speaking stronghold before the Balkan Wars. The Balkan Wars changed the nature of this region. The Muslim inhabitants who were forced out with the extending borders of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], mainly from [[Crete]], settled in this area. Under an old Ottoman Lieutenant Colonel [[Ali \u00c7etinkaya]], these people formed a unit. Along Ali \u00c7etinkaya's units, population in the region gathered around Re\u015fit, Tevfik and [[\u00c7erkes Ethem]]. These units were very determined to fight against Greece as there was no other place that they could be pushed back. Re\u015fit, Tevfik and Ethem were of [[Adyghe people|Circassian]] origin who were expelled from their ancestral lands in the Caucasus by the Russians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} They were settled around the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]]. Greek troops first met with these irregulars. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] asked Admiral [[Rauf Orbay]] if he could help in coordinating the units under Ali \u00c7etinkaya, Re\u015fit, Tevfik and \u00c7erkez Ethem. Rauf Orbay\u2014also of Circassian origin\u2014managed to link these groups. He asked them to cut the Greek logistic support lines.\n\nThe Allied decision to allow a Greek landing in Smyrna resulted from earlier Italian landings at Antalya. Faced with Italian annexation of parts of Asia Minor with a significant ethnic Greek population, Venizelos secured Allied permission for Greek troops to land in Smyrna, ostensibly in order to protect the civilian population from turmoil. Turks claim that Venizelos wanted to create a homogeneous Greek settlement to be able to annex it to Greece, and his public statements left little doubt about Greek intentions: \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to the expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>\"Not War Against Islam-Statement by Greek Prime Minister\" in ''The Scotsman'', 29 June 1920 p. 5</ref>\n\n=====Western active stage=====\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk asker\u00ee birlikleri denetlerken, \u0130zmit, 18 Haziran 1922.png|thumb|Kemal Pasha inspecting troops (18 June 1922)]]\n{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)}}\nAs soon as Greek forces landed in Smyrna, a Turkish nationalist opened fire prompting brutal reprisals. Greek forces used Smyrna as a base for launching attacks deeper into Anatolia. Mustafa Kemal refused to accept even a temporary Greek presence in Smyrna. Eventually, the Turkish nationalists with the aid of the Kemalist armed forces defeated the Greek troops and population and pushed them out of Smyrna and the rest of Anatolia.\n\n=====Western resolution=====\n[[File:Liberation of Istanbul on October 6, 1923.jpg|thumb|right|Turkish troops enter Constantinople on 6 October 1923]]\n{{Main|Chanak Crisis|Armistice of Mudanya}}\nWith the borders secured with treaties and agreements at east and south, Mustafa Kemal was now in a commanding position. The Nationalists were then able to demand on 5 September 1922 that the Greeks{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<!-- Greek military or Greek civilian population? --> evacuate East Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos as well as Asia Minor, and the [[Maritsa]] (''Turkish'' Meri\u00e7) River should again become the western border of Turkey, as before 1914. The British were prepared to defend the neutral zone of Constantinople and the Straits and the French asked Kemal to respect it,<ref>Harry J. Psomiades, ''The Eastern Question, the Last Phase: a Study in Greek-Turkish Diplomacy'' (Pella, New York 2000), 33.</ref> to which he agreed on 28 September.<ref>A. L.

In return, on 29 September Kemal asked for the negotiations to be started at [[Mudanya]]. Negotiations at Mudanya began on 3 October and it was concluded with the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. This was agreed on 11 October, two hours before the British intended to engage at [[Chanak]], and signed the next day. The Greeks initially refused to agree but did so on 13 October.<ref>Psomiades, 35.</ref> Factors persuading Turkey to sign may have included the arrival of British reinforcements.<ref>Macfie, 336.</ref>\n\nThe armistice then made it possible for the allies to recognise the Turkish claim to East Thrace, which was agreed to at the Lausanne Conference on 20 November 1922.<ref>Macfie, 341.</ref>\n\n====South====\n[[File:Kuvai-milliye-Millitias-from Turkish wikipedia.png|thumb|Turkish nationalist militias in Cilicia]]\n{{Main|Franco-Turkish War}}\n\nThe French wanted to take control of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. With pressure against the French, [[Cilicia]] would be easily left to the nationalists. The [[Taurus Mountains]] were critical to the Ankara government. The French soldiers were foreign to the region and they were using Armenian militia to acquire their intelligence. Turkish nationals had been in cooperation with Arab tribes in this area. Compared to the Greek threat, they were the second most dangerous for the Ankara government. He proposed that if the Greek threat could be dispersed, the French would not resist.\n\n===Conference of London===\n{{Details|Conference of London}}\n\nIn salvaging the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, The Triple Entente forced the Turkish Revolutionaries to agree with the terms through a series of conferences in London. The Conference of London, with sharp differences, failed in both the first stage and the second stages. The modified S\u00e8vres of the conference as a peace settlement was incompatible with the [[Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee|National Pact]].\n\nThe conference of London gave the Triple Entente an opportunity to reverse some of its policies. In October, parties to the conference received a report from Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol. He organized a commission to analyze the situation, and inquire into the bloodshed during the Occupation of Izmir and the following activities in the region. The commission reported that if annexation would not follow, Greece should not be the only occupation force in this area. Admiral Bristol was not so sure how to explain this annexation to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson as he insisted on \"respect for nationalities\" in the Fourteen Points. He believed that the sentiments of the Turks \"will never accept this annexation\".\n\nNeither the Conference of London nor Admiral [[Mark Lambert Bristol]]'s report changed British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s position. On 12 February 1921, he went with the annexation of the Aegean coast which was followed by the Greek offensive. David Lloyd George acted with his sentiments, which were developed during [[Gallipoli campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]], as opposed to [[George Milner (British Army officer)|General Milne]], who was his officer on the ground.\n\n==Peace negotiations==\n[[File:Turkije verjaagt Griekenland In Klein-Azi\u00eb (titel op object), NG-505-108.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon: Greek king Constantine runs away from the bomb which reads \"KEMAL\"]]\nFirst negotiations between the sides failed during the Conference of London. The stage for peace was set after the Triple Entente's decision to make an arrangement with the Turkish revolutionaries. Before the talks with the Entente, the nationalists partially settled their eastern borders with the Democratic Republic of Armenia, signing Treaty of Alexandropol, but changes in the Caucasus\u2014especially the establishment of the Armenian SSR\u2014required one more round of talks. The outcome was the Treaty of Kars, a successor treaty to the earlier [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] of March 1921. It was signed in [[Kars]] with the Russian SFSR on 13 October 1921<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=24 April 2007 }}</ref> and ratified in Yerevan on 11 September 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groong.usc.edu/treaties/kars.html|title=ANN/Groong -- Treaty of Berlin - 07/13/1878|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Armistice of Mudanya===\n{{Details|Armistice of Mudanya}}\n\nThe Marmara sea resort town of Mudanya hosted the conference to arrange the armistice on 3 October 1922. \u0130smet (\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc)\u2014commander of the western armies\u2014was in front of the Allies. The scene was unlike Mondros as the British and the Greeks were on the defense. Greece was represented by the Allies.\n\nThe British still expected the GNA to make concessions. From the first speech, the British were startled as Ankara demanded fulfillment of the National Pact. During the conference, the British troops in Constantinople were preparing for a Kemalist attack. There was never any fighting in Thrace, as Greek units withdrew before the Turks crossed the straits from Asia Minor. The only concession that Ismet made to the British was an agreement that his troops would not advance any farther toward the Dardanelles, which gave a safe haven for the British troops as long as the conference continued. The conference dragged on far beyond the original expectations. In the end, it was the British who yielded to Ankara's advances.\n\nThe Armistice of Mudanya was signed on 11 October. By its terms, the Greek army would move west of the Maritsa, clearing Eastern Thrace to the Allies. The famous American author Ernest Hemingway was in Thrace at the time, and he covered the evacuation of Eastern Thrace of its Greek population. He has several short stories written about Thrace and Smyrna, which appear in his book ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]''. The agreement came into force starting 15 October. Allied forces would stay in Eastern Thrace for a month to assure law and order. In return, Ankara would recognize continued British occupation of Constantinople and the Straits zones until the final treaty was signed.\n\nRefet Bele was assigned to seize control of Eastern Thrace from the Allies. He was the first representative to reach the old capital. The British did not allow the hundred gendarmes who came with him. That resistance lasted until the next day.\n\n===Abolition of the sultanate===\n{{Main|Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate}}\nKemal had long ago made up his mind to abolish the sultanate when the moment was ripe. After facing opposition from some members of the assembly, using his influence as a war hero, he managed to prepare a draft law for the abolition of the sultanate, which was then submitted to the National Assembly for voting. In that article, it was stated that the form of the government in Constantinople, resting on the sovereignty of an individual, had already ceased to exist when the British forces occupied the city after World War I.<ref name=\"Kinross, p. 348\">Kinross, ''Rebirth of a Nation'', p. 348</ref> Furthermore, it was argued that although the [[caliphate]] had belonged to the Ottoman Empire, it rested on the Turkish state by its dissolution and Turkish National Assembly would have right to choose a member of the Ottoman family in the office of caliph. On 1 November, The Turkish Grand Assembly voted for the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate. The last Sultan left Turkey on 17 November 1922, in a British battleship on his way to Malta. Such was the last act in the [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire]].\n\n===Conference of Lausanne===\n{{details|Lausanne Conference of 1922\u201323}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of the Ottoman Empire according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nThe [[Lausanne Conference of 1922\u201323|Conference of Lausanne]] began on 21 November 1922 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] and lasted into 1923. Its purpose was the negotiation of a [[treaty]] to replace the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], which, under the new government of the Grand National Assembly, was no longer recognised by [[Turkey]]. [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was the leading Turkish negotiator. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc maintained the basic position of the Ankara government that it had to be treated as an independent and sovereign state, equal with all other states attending the conference. In accordance with the directives of Mustafa Kemal, while discussing matters regarding the control of Turkish finances and justice, the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]], the [[Turkish Straits]] and the like, he refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty.<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 365</ref> Finally, after long debates, on 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed. Ten weeks after the signature the Allied forces left Istanbul.<ref>Kinross, Atat\u00fcrk, ''The Rebirth of a Nation'', 373.</ref>\n\nThe conference opened with representatives from the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and Turkey. It heard speeches from [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy and [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] of France. At its conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the \"freedom of the [[Dardanelles|straits]]\", which was Britain's main concern. The matter of the status of [[Mosul]] was deferred, since [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] refused to be budged on the British position that the area was part of [[Iraq]]. The British Iraq Mandate's possession of Mosul was confirmed by a League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain in 1926. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of their goals and on 30 January 1923 issued a statement that they did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a \"basis of discussion\". The Turks therefore refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to Ismet Pasha to sign, and when he refused the Foreign Secretary broke off negotiations and left that night on the [[Orient Express]].\n\n===Treaty of Lausanne===\n{{Main|Treaty of Lausanne (1923)}}\n\nThe Treaty of Lausanne, finally signed in July 1923, led to international recognition of the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Turkey]] as the [[successor state]] to the defunct [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne|title=Treaty of Lausanne - World War I Document Archive|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the Republic===\n[[File:Memory of Victory, 1925.jpg|thumb|200px|''Hat\u0131ra-i Zafer'' (Memory of Victory) by Hasan Sabri in 1925.]]\n\nA republic was [[Republic Day (Turkey)|proclaimed on 29 October 1923]], in the new capital of Ankara.
