Rather than providing only the dialogue and brief stage directions as would be expected in a play, Steinbeck fleshes out the scenes with details of both the characters and the environment. The intention was to allow the play to be read by the non-theatrical reader while still allowing the dialogue to be lifted and performed with little adaptation by acting companies. While Steinbeck could see that providing little information in the way of physical description or stage direction allowed the director and actors greater freedom and scope for imaginative interpretation, he weighed this against the benefit of making the players aware of the author's intent and making the play accessible to the general reader.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is a simple [[morality play]] concerning Joe Saul, an aging man desperate for a child. His young wife, Mordeen, who loves him, suspects that he is sterile, and in order to please him by bearing him a child, she becomes pregnant by Saul's cocky young assistant, Victor. The fourth character in the story is Friend Ed, a long-time friend of Saul and Mordeen, who helps the couple through the ordeal after Joe discovers that he is indeed infertile and the child can not be his. The story is meant to be that of an [[everyman]] (early in its development Steinbeck had thought of calling the play ''Everyman''), so the setting for each of the three acts recasts the four characters in different situations: the first act is set in a circus, Saul and Victor are [[trapeze|trapeze artists]] and Friend Ed, a clown; in the second act, Saul and Friend Ed become neighbouring farmers and Victor appears as Saul's farmhand. In the final act Saul is the captain of a ship, Mr. Victor, his mate, and Friend Ed a seaman about to put out on a different ship. Act three is divided into two scenes; the final scene is set in a hospital where the child is delivered; it makes no reference to any of the settings of the three acts, and so serves equally as a conclusion for any of the stories.\n\n==Development==\n''Burning Bright'' was Steinbeck's third attempt at writing what he called a \"play-novelette\". He had tried something similar with ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' in 1937 and ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' in 1942, but, of the three, ''Burning Bright'' was the most complete attempt at the form. Steinbeck believed that he may have been the first person to attempt the style. At the time of writing the introduction, in which he explained his intentions, he believed it was a form that would bear further experimentation. In a continuation of the experiment, a stage production was planned to open at the same time the book was published. The original title of the book, ''In the Forests of the Night'', was a line from ''[[The Tyger]]'' by [[William Blake]], but complaints that it was too long and too literary by the producers of the play led to the change to the shorter excerpt from the same poem: ''Burning Bright''.\n\nFriend Ed has been pointed out as one in a line of characters inspired by Steinbeck's best friend [[Ed Ricketts]]. At the time Steinbeck wrote ''Burning Bright'', Ricketts had recently been killed in a car accident, and as well as reflecting his friend's character in that of Friend Ed, it is thought that the settings of the circus and the sea may have had significance for Steinbeck: he had apparently been at the circus when he learnt of Ricketts' death and Ricketts' burial had been beside the sea.\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe stage production{{clarify|date=November 2015}} had [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] as producers, [[Guthrie McClintic]] as director, [[Kent Smith]] as Joe Saul, [[Barbara Bel Geddes]] as Mordeen, [[Howard Da Silva]] as Friend Ed, and [[Martin E. Brooks]] as Victor. The production had a short run at [[New Haven]] during which Steinbeck tightened up the second act, but despite his work on the play, confidence in it was fading. When the production moved to [[Boston]] for the main run the critical reviews were terrible, and the play closed after only thirteen performances. One of the co-producers admitted that he had known the production was doomed after the first night. Steinbeck was later upbeat about the failure of the play and stated he was still keen to continue working in the theatre:\n{{bquote| I'm just determined I'm going to learn something about the theatre. Last time we were kicked around like dogs, but I still want to do it. This shows a truly pure quality of stupidity. Just nuts.

Rather than providing only the dialogue and brief stage directions as would be expected in a play, Steinbeck fleshes out the scenes with details of both the characters and the environment. The intention was to allow the play to be read by the non-theatrical reader while still allowing the dialogue to be lifted and performed with little adaptation by acting companies. While Steinbeck could see that providing little information in the way of physical description or stage direction allowed the director and actors greater freedom and scope for imaginative interpretation, he weighed this against the benefit of making the players aware of the author's intent and making the play accessible to the general reader.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is a simple [[morality play]] concerning Joe Saul, an aging man desperate for a child. His young wife, Mordeen, who loves him, suspects that he is sterile, and in order to please him by bearing him a child, she becomes pregnant by Saul's cocky young assistant, Victor. The fourth character in the story is Friend Ed, a long-time friend of Saul and Mordeen, who helps the couple through the ordeal after Joe discovers that he is indeed infertile and the child can not be his. The story is meant to be that of an [[everyman]] (early in its development Steinbeck had thought of calling the play ''Everyman''), so the setting for each of the three acts recasts the four characters in different situations: the first act is set in a circus, Saul and Victor are [[trapeze|trapeze artists]] and Friend Ed, a clown; in the second act, Saul and Friend Ed become neighbouring farmers and Victor appears as Saul's farmhand. In the final act Saul is the captain of a ship, Mr. Victor, his mate, and Friend Ed a seaman about to put out on a different ship. Act three is divided into two scenes; the final scene is set in a hospital where the child is delivered; it makes no reference to any of the settings of the three acts, and so serves equally as a conclusion for any of the stories.\n\n==Development==\n''Burning Bright'' was Steinbeck's third attempt at writing what he called a \"play-novelette\". He had tried something similar with ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' in 1937 and ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' in 1942, but, of the three, ''Burning Bright'' was the most complete attempt at the form. Steinbeck believed that he may have been the first person to attempt the style. At the time of writing the introduction, in which he explained his intentions, he believed it was a form that would bear further experimentation. In a continuation of the experiment, a stage production was planned to open at the same time the book was published. The original title of the book, ''In the Forests of the Night'', was a line from ''[[The Tyger]]'' by [[William Blake]], but complaints that it was too long and too literary by the producers of the play led to the change to the shorter excerpt from the same poem: ''Burning Bright''.\n\nFriend Ed has been pointed out as one in a line of characters inspired by Steinbeck's best friend [[Ed Ricketts]]. At the time Steinbeck wrote ''Burning Bright'', Ricketts had recently been killed in a car accident, and as well as reflecting his friend's character in that of Friend Ed, it is thought that the settings of the circus and the sea may have had significance for Steinbeck: he had apparently been at the circus when he learnt of Ricketts' death and Ricketts' burial had been beside the sea.\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe stage production{{clarify|date=November 2015}} had [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] as producers, [[Guthrie McClintic]] as director, [[Kent Smith]] as Joe Saul, [[Barbara Bel Geddes]] as Mordeen, [[Howard Da Silva]] as Friend Ed, and [[Martin E. Brooks]] as Victor. The production had a short run at [[New Haven]] during which Steinbeck tightened up the second act, but despite his work on the play, confidence in it was fading. When the production moved to [[Boston]] for the main run the critical reviews were terrible, and the play closed after only thirteen performances. One of the co-producers admitted that he had known the production was doomed after the first night. Steinbeck was later upbeat about the failure of the play and stated he was still keen to continue working in the theatre:\n{{bquote| I'm just determined I'm going to learn something about the theatre.

Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected [[sound synthesis]] components, much of the design of the machine was contributed by [[Vladimir Ussachevsky]] and [[Peter Mauzey]]. The Mark II gave the user more flexibility and had twice the tone oscillators of its predecessor, the Mark I.<ref name=ieeeghn>\n{{cite web\n | year      = 2012\n | title     = RCA Mark I and Mark II Synthesizers\n | url       = http://ethw.org/RCA_Mark_I_and_Mark_II_Synthesizers\n | publisher = [[Engineering and Technology History Wiki]]\n | quote     = ''The success of the Mark I led to the creation of the Mark II, which had twice as many tone oscillators and gave the composer more flexibility.''\n}}{{verification needed|date=March 2015|reason=Reliable sources are not cited on this [http://ethw.org/ETHW:About ETHW] page}}</ref> The synthesizer was funded with a large grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].\n\nEarlier 20th century electronic instruments such as the [[Telharmonium]] or the [[theremin]] were manually operated. The RCA combined diverse electronic sound generation with a [[music sequencer]], which provided a huge attraction to [[composer]]s of the day, many of whom were growing tired of creating electronic works by splicing together individual sounds recorded on sections of [[magnetic tape]]. The RCA Mark II featured a fully automated [[Binary numeral system|binary]] sequencer using a [[paper tape]] reader analogous to a [[player piano]], that would send instructions to the synthesizer, automating playback of the machine.<ref name=olsonbelar1955>\n{{harvnb|Olson|Belar|1955}}\n</ref> The synthesizer would then output sound to a synchronized [[shellac]] record lathe next to the machine.<ref group=media>\n{{cite AV media\n | title     = 1950 early electronic synthesizer: 'This is music with a strictly electronic beat'\n | url       = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JManm091qWI\n | <!-- medium    = video -->\n | work      = YouTube\n | publisher = Clips & Footage\n}} \u201c''Electronic Music Synthesizer, 'No instruments necessary'! \"This is music with a strictly electronic beat\".

In fact, the RCA is cited by composers of the day as a contributing factor to the rise of musical [[complexity]], insofar as it allowed composers the freedom to write music using [[rhythm]]s and [[tempo]]s that were impractical, if not impossible, to realize on [[acoustic instrument]]s. This allure of precision as a mark of [[aesthetic]] progress (played out even today with contemporary [[computer]]-based sequencers) generated high expectations for the Mark II, and contributed to the increased awareness of electronic music as a viable new art form. An album featuring the instrument and its capabilities was issued by RCA (LM-1922) in 1955.<ref group=media>\n{{cite AV media\n | people    = Various\n | year      = 1955\n | title     = The Sounds And Music Of The RCA Electronic Music Synthesizer\n | url       = {{Discogs release|1146605|pure_url=yes}} <!-- http://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Sounds-And-Music-Of-The-RCA-Electronic-Music-Synthesizer/release/1146605 -->\n | medium    = Vinyl LP\n | location  = US\n | publisher = RCA Victor Red Seal\n | id        = LM-1922\n}}</ref>\n\nThe synthesizer had a four-note variable [[polyphony]] (in addition to twelve fixed-tone [[oscillator]]s and a [[white noise]] source).

Little attempt was made to teach composition on the synthesizer, and with few exceptions the only people proficient in the machine's usage were the designers at RCA and the engineering staff at Columbia who maintained it.

The last composer to get any sound out of the synthesizer was [[R. Luke DuBois]], who used it for a thirty-second piece on the [[Freight Elevator Quartet]]'s ''Jungle Album'' in 1997.\n\n[[Image:RCA Mark II victor - closeup (2).jpg|thumb|Closeup of ''Victor'' that lives up at Columbia [[Computer Music Center]]]]\nThough part of the history of electronic music, the RCA was hardly ever used. Made to [[United States Air Force]] construction specifications (and even sporting a USAF [[oscilloscope]]), its operating electronics were constructed entirely out of [[vacuum tube]]s, making the machine obsolete by its tenth birthday, having been surpassed by more reliable (and affordable) [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] modular synthesizers such as the [[Buchla]] and [[Moog modular synthesizer]] systems. It was prohibitively expensive to replicate, and an RCA Mark III, though conceived of by Belar and Olsen, was never constructed. Nor was RCA long for the synthesizer business, prompting Columbia to purchase enough spare parts to build two duplicate synthesizers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMuch of the historical interest of the RCA, besides its association with the Electronic Music Center, comes from a number of amusing (and possibly apocryphal) stories told regarding the synthesizer. One common story is that Ussachevsky and [[Otto Luening]] effectively [[confidence trick|con]]ned RCA into building the machine, claiming that a synthesizer built to their specifications would \"replace the [[symphony]] orchestra,\" prompting RCA executives to gamble the cost of the synthesizer in the hopes of being able to eliminate their ([[trade union|union]]ized) radio orchestra.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1959, the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center acquired the machine from RCA. At Columbia-Princeton, Milton Babbitt used it extensively.

Designed by Herbert Belar and [[Harry Olson]] at [[RCA]], it was installed at [[Columbia University]] in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected [[sound synthesis]] components, much of the design of the machine was contributed by [[Vladimir Ussachevsky]] and [[Peter Mauzey]]. The Mark II gave the user more flexibility and had twice the tone oscillators of its predecessor, the Mark I.<ref name=ieeeghn>\n{{cite web\n | year      = 2012\n | title     = RCA Mark I and Mark II Synthesizers\n | url       = http://ethw.org/RCA_Mark_I_and_Mark_II_Synthesizers\n | publisher = [[Engineering and Technology History Wiki]]\n | quote     = ''The success of the Mark I led to the creation of the Mark II, which had twice as many tone oscillators and gave the composer more flexibility.''\n}}{{verification needed|date=March 2015|reason=Reliable sources are not cited on this [http://ethw.org/ETHW:About ETHW] page}}</ref> The synthesizer was funded with a large grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].\n\nEarlier 20th century electronic instruments such as the [[Telharmonium]] or the [[theremin]] were manually operated. The RCA combined diverse electronic sound generation with a [[music sequencer]], which provided a huge attraction to [[composer]]s of the day, many of whom were growing tired of creating electronic works by splicing together individual sounds recorded on sections of [[magnetic tape]]. The RCA Mark II featured a fully automated [[Binary numeral system|binary]] sequencer using a [[paper tape]] reader analogous to a [[player piano]], that would send instructions to the synthesizer, automating playback of the machine.<ref name=olsonbelar1955>\n{{harvnb|Olson|Belar|1955}}\n</ref> The synthesizer would then output sound to a synchronized [[shellac]] record lathe next to the machine.<ref group=media>\n{{cite AV media\n | title     = 1950 early electronic synthesizer: 'This is music with a strictly electronic beat'\n | url       = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JManm091qWI\n | <!-- medium    = video -->\n | work      = YouTube\n | publisher = Clips & Footage\n}} \u201c''Electronic Music Synthesizer, 'No instruments necessary'! \"This is music with a strictly electronic beat\".

In fact, the RCA is cited by composers of the day as a contributing factor to the rise of musical [[complexity]], insofar as it allowed composers the freedom to write music using [[rhythm]]s and [[tempo]]s that were impractical, if not impossible, to realize on [[acoustic instrument]]s. This allure of precision as a mark of [[aesthetic]] progress (played out even today with contemporary [[computer]]-based sequencers) generated high expectations for the Mark II, and contributed to the increased awareness of electronic music as a viable new art form. An album featuring the instrument and its capabilities was issued by RCA (LM-1922) in 1955.<ref group=media>\n{{cite AV media\n | people    = Various\n | year      = 1955\n | title     = The Sounds And Music Of The RCA Electronic Music Synthesizer\n | url       = {{Discogs release|1146605|pure_url=yes}} <!-- http://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Sounds-And-Music-Of-The-RCA-Electronic-Music-Synthesizer/release/1146605 -->\n | medium    = Vinyl LP\n | location  = US\n | publisher = RCA Victor Red Seal\n | id        = LM-1922\n}}</ref>\n\nThe synthesizer had a four-note variable [[polyphony]] (in addition to twelve fixed-tone [[oscillator]]s and a [[white noise]] source). The synthesizer was very difficult to set up, requiring extensive [[Patch cable|patch]]ing of [[analog (signal)|analog]] circuitry prior to running a score. Little attempt was made to teach composition on the synthesizer, and with few exceptions the only people proficient in the machine's usage were the designers at RCA and the engineering staff at Columbia who maintained it.

The last composer to get any sound out of the synthesizer was [[R. Luke DuBois]], who used it for a thirty-second piece on the [[Freight Elevator Quartet]]'s ''Jungle Album'' in 1997.\n\n[[Image:RCA Mark II victor - closeup (2).jpg|thumb|Closeup of ''Victor'' that lives up at Columbia [[Computer Music Center]]]]\nThough part of the history of electronic music, the RCA was hardly ever used. Made to [[United States Air Force]] construction specifications (and even sporting a USAF [[oscilloscope]]), its operating electronics were constructed entirely out of [[vacuum tube]]s, making the machine obsolete by its tenth birthday, having been surpassed by more reliable (and affordable) [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] modular synthesizers such as the [[Buchla]] and [[Moog modular synthesizer]] systems. It was prohibitively expensive to replicate, and an RCA Mark III, though conceived of by Belar and Olsen, was never constructed. Nor was RCA long for the synthesizer business, prompting Columbia to purchase enough spare parts to build two duplicate synthesizers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMuch of the historical interest of the RCA, besides its association with the Electronic Music Center, comes from a number of amusing (and possibly apocryphal) stories told regarding the synthesizer. One common story is that Ussachevsky and [[Otto Luening]] effectively [[confidence trick|con]]ned RCA into building the machine, claiming that a synthesizer built to their specifications would \"replace the [[symphony]] orchestra,\" prompting RCA executives to gamble the cost of the synthesizer in the hopes of being able to eliminate their ([[trade union|union]]ized) radio orchestra.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1959, the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center acquired the machine from RCA. At Columbia-Princeton, Milton Babbitt used it extensively. His tape and tape and instrument pieces were realized using the RCA Mark II, including his masterpiece ''Philomel'', for synthesized sound and soprano.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title     = RCA Mark II\n | url       = http://www.synthmuseum.com/rca/rca02.html\n | work      = Synthmuseum.com\n}};\nbased on\n{{cite book\n | last      = Forrest | first = Peter\n | title     = The A-Z of Analogue Synthesizers\n | series    = N-Z Pt. 2\n | location  = Devon, England\n | publisher = Susurreal Publishing\n | date = 1996\n | isbn      = 978-0-95243770-3\n}}, copyright 1994 Peter Forrest;\nwith additional help from Eric Chasalow\n</ref>\n\n[[Image:RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, Computer Music Center at Columbia University, NIME2007.jpg|thumb|''Victor'' in 2007]]\nThe RCA is still housed at the Columbia [[Computer Music Center]] facility on 125th Street in [[New York City]], where it is bolted to the floor in the office of Professor [[Brad Garton]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Media\n{{Reflist|group=media}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Overall\n* {{cite book\n   | last      = Olson | first = Harry Ferdinand\n   | chapter   = <!-- Chapter Ten: -->Electronic Music\n   | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=q4zgPgWIW5YC&pg=PA408\n   | title     = Music, Physics and Engineering\n   | publisher = Courier Corporation\n   | date = 1967\n   | pages     = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4zgPgWIW5YC&pg=PA408 408]&ndash;448\n   | isbn      = 978-0-486-21769-7\n  }}\n:&emsp;\t''See \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4zgPgWIW5YC&pg=PA435 D.

Many of their videos were shot on 35&nbsp;mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time.<ref name=\"DD Videos\"/> They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian director [[Russell Mulcahy]] for some of their most memorable video offerings.

They were doing jobs at the club, John working the door and Nick deejaying for \u00a310 a night. They began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. There were many nearby nightclubs where bands such as [[the Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]] played gigs; the most significant was called [[Barbarella's]]. They went on to name the band after \"Dr. Durand Durand\", [[Milo O'Shea]]'s character from the sci-fi film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''.\n\nThe band's first singer was [[Stephen Duffy]]. Simon Colley soon joined Taylor, Rhodes and Duffy. Colley was the band's original bass player, as John Taylor was the guitarist at this point. This was the first complete line-up of the band that played live shows. For percussion, an electronic drum machine belonging to Rhodes was used. Colley left the band prior to the addition of Andy Taylor. A few guitarists were subsequently auditioned, mostly unsuccessfully, as well as a handful of vocalists after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979.<ref name=Blender>{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Odell |title=Fame Had Its Way With Us! |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=316 |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |publisher=Dennis Publishing |date=June\u2013July 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626185804/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=316 |archivedate=26 June 2007  }}</ref> Among them was Andy Wickett, a vocalist they had prior to Simon Le Bon. Wickett had a major part in the writing of \"[[Girls on Film]]\" during his tenure with the band, according to Andy Taylor's autobiography. Wickett is also featured on some of the demos that were presented to EMI. According to both Wickett's and John Taylor's websites, Wickett co-wrote an early version of the song that came to be known as \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\". Upon Colley's and Wickett's departures, the band enlisted singer Jeff Thomas and guitarist Alan Curtis, each for only a relatively brief period, before finally settling on Andy Taylor for lead guitar and Le Bon for vocals in 1980.\n\nThe meeting of drummer [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]] in 1979 with John Taylor, Rhodes and Wickett at a party, as well as the departure of Colley, led John Taylor to switch to bass. Roger Taylor then became their original (human) drummer. It was this line-up (John Taylor on bass and guitar along with Rhodes, Wickett and Roger Taylor) that made the first-ever Duran Duran studio demo tapes. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to audition after responding to an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. In May 1980, London vocalist Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the [[Rum Runner (nightclub)|Rum Runner]].<ref name=\"Green\">{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Jo-Anne|title = Your Mission, Barbarella: Find Duran Duran|journal=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|volume = 24|issue = 456 |publisher=F+W Publications Inc.|date = 16 January 1998|url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html | accessdate =1 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304091132/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html |archivedate = 4 March 2007}}</ref> The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and barmen when they were not rehearsing.\n\nIn 1980 they recorded two demo tapes and performed in clubs around [[Birmingham]] and London. Later that same year, when touring as an opening act for [[Hazel O'Connor]], the band attracted critical attention, resulting in a bidding war between the record companies [[EMI Records|EMI]] and [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]].<ref name=Malins-60>Malins (2006), p. 60</ref> \"A certain patriotism\" toward the label of [[The Beatles]] led them to sign with EMI in December.\n\nDuran Duran were amongst the earliest bands to work on their own [[remix]]es. Before the days of digital synthesisers and easy [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], they created multi-layered arrangements of their singles, sometimes recording entirely different extended performances of the songs in the studio. These \"night versions\" were generally available only on [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] to 45 rpm singles or on 12-inch club singles until the release of the compilation ''[[Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran]]'' in 1999.\n\nFrom the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as [[Kahn & Bell]] and [[Antony Price]] to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam Ant during 1980\u201381. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with [[Vivienne Westwood]] and in the 2000s with [[Giorgio Armani]]. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer [[Malcolm Garrett]] and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.<ref name=TheirStory>{{Cite book|last=De Graaf |first=Kaspar |author2=Garret, Malcolm |title=Duran Duran: Their Story |year=1982 |publisher=Cherry Lane Books |location=UK |isbn=0-86276-171-9 |page=14}}</ref>\n\nAll five members of the band were photogenic. Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in [[teen magazine]]s such as ''[[Smash Hits]]'' or ''[[Tiger Beat]]''. John Taylor once remarked that the band was \"like a box of [[Quality Street (confection)|Quality Street]] [chocolates]; everyone is someone's favourite\"<ref>De Graaf & Garret (1982), p. 15.</ref> Duran Duran later came to regret this early pin-up exposure, but at the time it helped attract national attention. In an interview with Rock Fever Superstars Magazine in early 1988, John Taylor stated:\n\n<blockquote>We used to be a very chi-chi name to drop in '79, but then the Fab Five hype started and something went wrong. Something went really wrong. That wasn't what I wanted. [...] Not that I didn't like being screamed at. At one point I really did\".<ref>Sprague, David: ''The Death of Duran Duran''.

The first single, \"[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]\", reached the United Kingdom's top 20 at number 12. A follow-up, \"[[Careless Memories]]\", stalled at Number 37. However, it was their third single, \"Girls on Film\", that attracted the most attention. The song went to Number 5 in the UK. The video featuring topless women [[mud wrestling]], [[pillow fight]]ing and stylised depictions of other [[sexual fetish]]es, was made with directing duo [[Godley & Creme]] in August.<ref name=\"Shuker 2001, p. 170\">Shuker (2001), p. 170.</ref> The video was filmed just two weeks after MTV was launched in the United States.<ref name=Malins-7>Malins (2006), pp. 77\u201379.</ref> The band expected the \"[[Girls on Film]]\" video to be played in the newer nightclubs that had video screens or on [[pay TV]] channels like the [[Playboy Channel]]. [[Kevin Godley]] explained the thinking behind it:\n\n<blockquote>We were very explicitly told by Duran Duran's management to make a very sensational and erotic piece that would be for clubs, where it would get shown uncensored just to make people take notice and talk about it.<ref name=\"Shuker 2001, p. 170\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe video was heavily edited for MTV (Music Television). The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number 3. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of [[1981 Moss Side riot|Moss Side]] and [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth]]. The band played Birmingham the day after the [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]]. Duran Duran began to achieve worldwide recognition in 1982. In May they released their second album, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'', which scored four UK Top Twenty singles with \"[[My Own Way (song)|My Own Way]]\", \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\", \"[[Save a Prayer]]\", and the title song \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\". A headlining tour of Australia, Japan, and the US was followed by a stint supporting [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] during that band's final American tour. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] declared Duran Duran her favourite band, and the band were dubbed \"the Fab Five\" by the British press, comparing them to [[the Beatles]] whose nickname was the Fab Four.<ref name=Malins-118>Malins (2006), p. 118.</ref>\n\nAt first, the ''Rio'' album did not do well in the United States. EMI in the UK had promoted Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic movement was barely known in the US, and EMI's American subsidiary [[Capitol Records]] was at a loss about how to sell them. After ''[[Carnival (ep)|Carnival]]'' (an [[Extended play|EP]] of ''Rio''{{'s}} dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the fall, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by [[David Kershenbaum]]. In June 1982, Duran Duran appeared for the first time on American television, performing \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Rio\" on ''[[Dancin' On Air]]'', the forerunner to the national hit show ''[[Dance Party USA]]''.\n\nNow promoted as a dance album, ''Rio'' was re-released in the US in November, and began to climb the American charts six months after its European success. MTV placed \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and several other Duran Duran videos into heavy rotation, pushing the single and album into the US top twenty in early 1983. The ballad \"Save a Prayer\" also did well.<ref>Denisoff (1986), pp. 364\u20135.</ref> \"The band was a natural for music television,\" noted ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. \"They may be the first rock group to ride in on a video wave.\"<ref>Denisoff (1986), p. 365.</ref> The album ultimately peaked at number 6 in the US and remained on the charts there for 129 weeks.

To satisfy America's appetite for their music,<ref name=\"Green\" /> the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single \"[[Is There Something I Should Know?]]\". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first [[chart-topper]] in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] for a show, during which artist and admirer [[Andy Warhol]] dropped by to greet them. \"Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty\", Rhodes said later, \"But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was [[Beatlemania]]. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in [[Times Square]]. We couldn't get out of the store.

With \"Hungry Like the Wolf\", \"Rio\", \"Save a Prayer\" and \"Is There Something I Should Know?\", Duran Duran now had five US Top Twenty hits from three different albums in a single year. The band made music headlines by deciding to release the \"Union of the Snake\" video to MTV a full week before the single was released to radio. They followed up with \"[[New Moon on Monday]]\", which reached Number 9 in the UK. Their next single \"[[The Reflex]]\", taken from ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and given a significant remix overhaul by [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]] fame, became their first number one hit in the United States. \"The Reflex\" was also their second and final [[List of number-one singles (UK)|UK number one]] and was successful in numerous other countries around the world.\n\nThe band embarked on a global tour that continued throughout the first four months of 1984 including their first major stadium dates in America. A film crew led by director Russell Mulcahy followed the band closely, leading to the documentary film ''[[Sing Blue Silver]]'' and the accompanying [[concert film]] ''[[Arena (An Absurd Notion)|Arena]]''. The live album ''[[Arena (Duran Duran album)|Arena]]'' was also recorded during the tour and was released with the new studio single \"[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]\", which went to number 2 on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and won two [[Grammy Award]]s in the brand-new [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Long Form]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Short Form]] music video categories. Meanwhile, \"[[Save a Prayer]]\" gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single's B-side, taken from the concert video footage for ''Arena'' / ''[[As the Lights Go Down]]''.\n\nDuring this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], and Nick Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Hauptfuhrer|first = Fred |title = Wedding bells toll for Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, who marries an Iowa heiress|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date = 3 September 1985 |url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html | accessdate =18 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412062952/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html |archivedate = 12 April 2007}}</ref> At the end of 1984, the group were featured on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] benefit single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" along with other popular British musical acts. Simon Le Bon sang between contributions from [[George Michael]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].\n\n===1985: Side projects and Live Aid===\nEven with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] to form the rock/funk supergroup [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]], who released one LP (''So Red the Rose'') from which the single \"Election Day\" was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist [[Masami Tsuchiya]], bassist [[Mark Egan]], percussionist [[David Van Tieghem]], drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[David Gilmour]]. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\"<ref name=Blender/> The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" to the 1985 [[James Bond]] movie [[A View to a Kill|of the same name]]. This single was the first [[James Bond music|Bond theme]] to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.\n\nAs a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5&nbsp;billion TV viewers) at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[John F.

After [[Live Aid]] and Arcadia, drummer Roger Taylor retired to the English countryside, suffering from exhaustion.<ref name=Malins-181>Malins (2006), p. 181.</ref> This was originally announced as a one-year [[sabbatical]], but it soon became clear that he would not be returning to the band. An official press release was issued in April 1986 confirming his departure. In a 2004 interview with Live Daily, Roger Taylor confirmed his reasons for leaving: \"I was burned out. I think I was just exhausted. It was a very intense five years. We didn't stop. It was constant touring, constant writing, recording. We broke internationally, as well\u2014instantly, pretty well. It's a nonstop schedule, really. I had lost myself somewhere.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/march-1985-duran-durans-roger-taylor/|title=Duran Duran\u2019s Roger Taylor|website=Modern Drummer Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist Andy Taylor led the remaining members to believe he would return to work on a new Duran Duran album even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles, eventually releasing a solo album in 1986 called ''[[Thunder (Andy Taylor album)|Thunder]]''. The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio, but after numerous delays, they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album while the disagreements were being settled.<ref name=Malins-187>Malins (2006), pp. 187\u2013190.</ref>\n\nWithout a guitarist or a drummer, the three remaining members, Le Bon, Rhodes, and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) [[Nile Rodgers]] play a few tracks on guitar, and hired [[Steve Ferrone]] to play drums while they searched for replacements. Finally in September 1986, [[Warren Cuccurullo]] (formerly of [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s band) was hired as a session guitarist. With Le Bon, Rhodes, and Taylor, he recorded the rest of the ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film ''Three to Get Ready'' chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.\n\nAlthough the song \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" went to number 2 in the US, number 7 in the UK, and album sales were strong, the band found they had lost much of the momentum and hysteria they had left behind in 1985. In the three years between the release of ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and ''Notorious'', many of their teenage fans had grown up, and the music was funkier, more mature, and less \"pop\", given the added experience of their work on Arcadia and Power Station and with other musicians. \"[[Skin Trade (song)|Skin Trade]]\" and \"[[Meet El Presidente]]\", the two subsequent singles, made the charts but fared poorly compared to the band's earlier successes. Finally in late 1987, [[Sterling Campbell]] was hired as a session drummer.\n\nSubsequently, Duran Duran struggled to escape the [[teen idol]] image and gain respect among critics with more complex music. The new serious image was not accepted at first and their popularity began to wane. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, \"In their search for musical maturity, the surviving Durans have lost a good deal of their identity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Coleman |first =Mark |title =Review of ''Notorious'' |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Publishing |date = 29 January 1987 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 | accessdate =14 May 2007 }}</ref> In contrast the New York Times said, \"Duran Duran's newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps \"Notorious\" suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|title=A Smaller Duran Duran Finds Disillusionment|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=1986-12-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Another factor was the band's dismissal of early managers, the Berrow brothers. There was no announcement of the reasons for the decision, but disagreements over money, and the brothers' involvement in Le Bon's yachting adventures (they were co-owners of ''[[Drum (yacht)|Drum]]'') were thought to have played a part.<ref name=Malins-174>Malins (2006), p. 174.</ref> Whatever the reason, Duran Duran switched managers frequently and undertook periods of self-management in the later stages of their career. In addition, EMI fired its president and went through a major corporate restructuring that summer and seemed to have lost interest in promoting the band.<ref name=Malins-186>Malins (2006), p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe next album ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988) yielded the singles \"[[I Don't Want Your Love]]\" (number 4 in the US), and \"[[All She Wants Is]]\" (the last top ten hit in the UK until 1993). The record was experimental, mixing influences from [[house music]] and [[rave]]s with Duran's atmospheric [[synthpop]] and the creative guitar work of Cuccurullo (now a full band member), as well as more mature lyrics.\n\n===1989\u20131991: Five again, ''Decade'' and ''Liberty''===\nBy the end of 1989 and at the start of the 1990s, the popularity of synthpop was fading a bit and losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]] and [[alternative rock]]. After touring for the album finished, the band regained a five-man membership as guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and tour drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] were made full members of Duran Duran.<ref>\n{{Cite book|last=D'Antonio |first=Christian |author2=Santone, Marcello |title=Duran Duran 1981/2006&nbsp;\u2013 Glam Pop Party |publisher=Editori Riuniti/Momenti Rock |location=Italy |isbn=88-359-5857-1 |date= 1 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe compilation album ''[[Decade (Duran Duran album)|Decade]]'' was released late in 1989, along with the [[megamix]] single \"[[Burning the Ground]]\", which consisted of woven snippets of the band's hits from the previous ten years, created and produced with John Jones, who began working with the band after Big Thing. The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. However, the 1990 release ''[[Liberty (Duran Duran album)|Liberty]]'' (a retreat from the experimentation of ''Big Thing'') failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles \"[[Violence of Summer|Violence of Summer (Love's Taking Over)]]\" and \"[[Serious (Duran Duran song)|Serious]]\" were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 213.</ref> Sterling Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with [[Soul Asylum]] and [[David Bowie]]. The quartet of Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor, and Cuccurullo would remain intact for six more years. In December 1991, John Taylor (then 31) married 19-year-old model/actress [[Amanda De Cadenet]], and she gave birth to his daughter in March 1992.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 219.</ref>\n\n===1992\u20131996: Quartet line-up and a brief comeback===\nIn 1993, the band released a second self-titled album: this ''[[Duran Duran (1993 album)|Duran Duran]]'' album is known as ''The Wedding Album'' (for [[Nick Egan]]'s cover art featuring the wedding photos of the band members' parents) to distinguish it from the 1981 release, and was produced and recorded with John Jones. The release of this first \"comeback\" album was delayed, with then manager at Left Bank, Tommy Manzi, later telling [[HitQuarters]] that this was due to industry resistance to the revival of the band, whom he said would rather focus on \"the next hip band\".<ref name=\"hitquarters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_TManzi.html |title=Interview With Tommy Manzi |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=7 May 2001 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212527/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_TManzi.html |archive-date=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Listener demand for leaked single \"[[Ordinary World]]\" forced it onto radio playlists months earlier than planned; it reached number 3 on the US chart and number 6 in the UK and won a prestigious [[Ivor Novello Award]] for song writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synentertainment.com/2001/main/2000/corpo/c-2001/corporate-f-directors.html |title=Simon Le Bon bio |publisher=Syn Entertainment corporate website |accessdate=16 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928085135/http://www.synentertainment.com/2001/main/2000/corpo/c-2001/corporate-f-directors.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\", primarily written by Cuccurullo, with lyrics by Le Bon, made number 7 in the US and number 13 in the UK. Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (No.&nbsp;4 in the UK, No.&nbsp;7 in the US). Bassist John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained [[vocal cords]]. After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nIn 1995, the band released the cover album ''[[Thank You (Duran Duran album)|Thank You]]''. Songs from ''Thank You'' included covers of [[Lou Reed]]'s \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" and [[Melle Mel]]'s \"[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]\" (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on \"Watching the Detectives\" and \"Perfect Day\" (as well as a cover of \"Jeepster\" by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's [[electronic press kit]], Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref name=Edwards />\n\n===1997\u20132000: John Taylor's departure and second trio===\nAfter the promo tour for ''Thank You'' was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Neurotic Outsiders]], and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce from De Cadenet. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, ''Medazzaland'', in January 1997, Taylor announced at the DuranCon [[fan convention]] that he was leaving the band \"for good\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Michelle|title = Duran Duran Comes Undone|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Publishing|date = 23 January 1997 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone | accessdate =18 May 2007 }}</ref> His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.\n\nFreed from some internal writing conflicts, the band returned to the studio to rewrite and re-record many of the songs on ''[[Medazzaland]]''. (Taylor's work remains on only four tracks.) This album marked a return to the layered experimentation of ''Big Thing'', with intricate guitar textures and processed vocals. The track \"[[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out of My Mind]]\" was used as the theme song for the movie ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', but the only true single to be released in the United States was the quirky \"[[Electric Barbarella]]\", which was the first single ever to be sold online.<ref>Haring, pp. 77\u20139.</ref> The video for this single, featuring a sexy robot purchased and played with by band members, had to be censored before airing on MTV, but there was little of the controversy that had surrounded \"Girls on Film\". \"Barbarella\" peaked at No.&nbsp;52 in the US in October 1997.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 246.</ref> Although ''Medazzaland'' was released in the US in October 1997, the album was never released in the UK. \"Barbarella\" was later released in the UK as a single from the 1998 ''[[Greatest (Duran Duran)|Greatest]]'' compilation album and peaked at No.&nbsp;23 on the UK chart in January 1999. The group played a set at the Princess Diana Tribute Concert on 27 June 1998 by special request of her family.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands in party tribute to Diana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/121635.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 June 1998|accessdate=18 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDuran Duran parted ways with Capitol/EMI in 1999, although the label has since used Duran Duran's back catalogue to release several compilations of remixes and rare vinyl-only B-sides. The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with Disney's [[Hollywood Records]], but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''. This slow-paced and heavy album seemed out-of-keeping with earlier band material.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 256.</ref> Rhodes' intricate production and Cuccurullo's songwriting and experimentation with guitar sounds and time signatures were not enough to hook the public, and the album did not perform well. The dreamy single \"[[Someone Else Not Me]]\" lasted barely two weeks on the radio, although its video was noted as the first to be produced entirely with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation. While supporting ''Medazzaland'' and ''Pop Trash'', Duran Duran toured with bassist [[Wes Wehmiller]] and drummer Joe Travers.\n\n===2001\u20132006: Reunion===\n[[File:Duran Duran.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran at the [[Air Canada Centre|Scotiabank Arena]], Toronto in April 2005.]]\nIn 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the ''Pop Trash'' tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger, and Andy Taylor had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.\n\nThroughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, the band worked on writing new material, initially renting a house in [[St. Tropez]] where sound engineer [[Mark Tinley]] built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and search for a new record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations.<ref name=\"Sandall\" /> The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out ''en masse'' for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played on both sides of the pond when they first got together in the early 1980s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]], only to be surprised with a [[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2004.<ref name=\"OConnell\">{{Cite news| first=John |last=O'Connell |title= Old Romantics |url= http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |work=[[Sunday Herald]] | publisher=Newsquest |date=11 April 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040508202943/http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |archivedate = 8 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duran Duran NYC 2005.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran in New York City in 2005]]\nThe pace picked up with a sold-out tour of America, Australia and New Zealand. The band played a full concert at a private tailgate party at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], their performance of \"The Wild Boys\" broadcast to millions during the pre-game show. A [[remix]] of the new track \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\" was released on many TV shows in February while magazines hailed (the modern \"Fab Five\") Duran Duran as one of the greatest bands of all time.<ref name=\"Ferber\">{{Cite news|first=Lawrence |last=Ferber |title=Wild Boys take 2 |url= http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm|work=[[Southern Voice (newspaper)|Southern Voice]]|publisher=[[Window Media]]|date=29 October 2004}}</ref> Duran Duran then celebrated their homecoming to the UK with fourteen stadium dates in April 2004, including five sold-out nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. The British press, traditionally hostile to the band, accorded the shows some very warm reviews.<ref>Malins (2006), pp. 273\u2013274</ref> Duran Duran brought along band [[Goldfrapp]] and the [[Scissor Sisters]] as alternating opening acts for this tour.<ref name=\"Sandall\" /> The last two shows were filmed, resulting in the concert DVD ''[[Live from London (Duran Duran)|Duran Duran: Live from London]]'' which was released in November.\n\nFinally, with more than thirty-five songs completed, the band signed a two-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in June, and completed the new album, now entitled ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The album was released in October 2004 and entered the UK charts at number 3 and the US charts at number 17. The first single was \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", which reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' US Dance chart in November and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, Duran Duran's highest chart position since \"A View to a Kill\" in 1985. A second single, \"[[What Happens Tomorrow]]\", debuted at No.&nbsp;11 on the UK chart in February. A 5.1 mix of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'' was created by Jeremy Wheatley for the dual-disc release of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The CD side contains the album as-is and the DVD side contains the 5.1 mix of the album in DVD Audio format along with some DVD footage and videos.\n\nAfter a world tour in early 2005, Duran Duran were presented with the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the 2005 Ivor Novello Awards. Later that summer, the band headlined the massive [[Live 8 concert, Rome]] on 2 July 2005 in the [[Circus Maximus]].\n\n===2006\u20132008: ''Red Carpet Massacre'' and Andy Taylor's second departure===\n[[File:Duran Duran Bogota 2008.JPG|thumb|right|230px|The band in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 2008]]\nIn early 2006, Duran Duran covered [[John Lennon]]'s song \"[[Instant Karma!]]\" for the ''Make Some Noise'' campaign sponsored by [[Amnesty International]]. Their version later appeared on ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' as an [[iTunes]] exclusive bonus track. They also performed at two high-profile events&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize Awards]] and the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. After a couple of weeks of songwriting in Northern California, the band began working with producer [[Michael Patterson (producer)|Michael Patterson]] in London, and continued intermittently for the next several months. At one point, they reported having had fifteen tracks nearly complete for an album tentatively titled ''[[Reportage (album)|Reportage]]'', but no further news emerged from the band for months afterward. In September, the band held meetings in New York City with [[Justin Timberlake]] and producer [[Timbaland]] with an eye to a potential collaboration and were soon reported to have completed three songs with the producer, including a song with [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref>[http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206035639/http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 October 2006, Duran Duran parted company with Andy Taylor once again. In an official announcement on their website, the band stated that an \"unworkable gulf\" had developed between them and Taylor and that \"we can no longer effectively function together\". It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book \"Wild Boy\" that tensions had arisen between the group's management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]], who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dombrown.com/ |title= Dominic Brown: Musician with Duran Duran |publisher=dombrown.com |accessdate =16 May 2006 }}</ref> After Taylor's departure, the band scrapped the ''Reportage'' album.

[[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]] is the featured guitarist on the album.\n\nIn July 2007, the band performed twice at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Their first appearance at the stadium was the [[Concert for Diana]] which celebrated the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] almost 10 years after her death. The band performed \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", \"[[Wild Boys (song)|Wild Boys]]\" and \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |title= Concert for Diana - What happened minute by minute|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2013 }}</ref> Their second appearance was at [[Live Earth concert, London]]. On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration \"[[Falling Down (Duran Duran song)|Falling Down]]\" was released as a download single on [[iTunes]], and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on Broadway to launch the ''Red Carpet Massacre'' album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007.\n\nIn May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band [[Your Vegas]]. In June 2008, they played the [[Louvre]] in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a [[Louis XV]] drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum's artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the [[I.M. Pei]]-designed [[Louvre Pyramid|Pyramid du Louvre]]. The group's performance marked a first for the 18th century museum which had never before allowed a rock concert to occur anywhere within the grounds or buildings and another groundbreaker for Duran Duran.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, in Paris, [[Mark Ronson]] performed a unique live set with Duran Duran for an exclusive, invitation-only performance. Together, they showcased specially re-worked versions of some of Duran Duran's classic hits re-created by Ronson, along with tracks from ''Red Carpet Massacre''. Simon Le Bon also performed songs from Ronson's latest album, ''[[Version (album)|Version]]'', as one of Ronson's featured guest vocalists. Unlike the band's previous album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', ''Red Carpet Massacre'' sold poorly and received mixed responses from the music press. In 2008, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' was included in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' series.\n\n===2009\u20132012: Dominic Brown era and ''All You Need Is Now''===\n[[File:Duran Duran (6874514374).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], Australia in 2012]]\nThe band departed from Epic Records in 2009, after releasing just two albums. In early 2010, it was revealed that the band would be contributing a cover of \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" to a tribute/charity record for [[David Bowie]] called ''[[We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie|We Were So Turned On]]'' from which all profits go to [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. Other contributing artists included [[Carla Bruni]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros]], and [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]]. The album was released on 14 September 2010 on [[Manimal Vinyl]] Records. A limited edition split 7\" single with Duran Duran and [[Carla Bruni]] was also released on [[Manimal Vinyl]] in December 2010.\n\nIn November 2010, Duran Duran announced the worldwide release of their 13th studio album, entitled ''[[All You Need Is Now]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?page_id=14246/ |title=Main |publisher=Duran Duran |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> which was to be released on the band's own Tapemodern label and distributed by indie label [[S-Curve Records]]. The album, produced by the [[Grammy]] Award-winning [[Mark Ronson]] and mixed by [[Spike Stent]], was released exclusively on [[iTunes]] on 21 December 2010 and hit the No.&nbsp;1 spot on download charts in 15 countries (including the UK).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |title=ALL YOU NEED IS NOW Out in the UK on March&nbsp;21 |publisher=Duran Duran |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> The first single from the record, title track \"All You Need Is Now\", was free to download worldwide on 8 December 2010 exclusively in iTunes.

Denisoff (1986), p. 365.</ref> MTV needed showcase videos with charismatic performers. Les Garland, senior executive vice-president at MTV, said \"I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, \"You have got to see this video that's come in\". Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was the greatest video I'd ever seen\".<ref name=Blender/> The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Antigua]], creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget \"band-playing-on-a-stage\" videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" riffs on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', \"The Wild Boys\" on ''[[The Road Warrior]]'', etc.). Videos were obviously headed in this direction already, but Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.\n\nDuran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot with a professional movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or \"anything with synthesisers\". Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, [[Tears for Fears]], [[Def Leppard]] and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |title= Music Television|accessdate=17 May 2007 |author=Burns, Gary |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}</ref> The band's sun-drenched videos for \"Rio\", \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Save a Prayer\", and the surreal \"Is There Something I Should Know?\" were filmed by future movie director [[Russell Mulcahy]], who made 11 videos for the band. Duran Duran have always sought out innovative directors and techniques, even in their later years when MTV gave them little airplay. In addition to Mulcahy, they have had videos filmed by influential photographers [[Dean Chamberlain]] and [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Chinese director [[Chen Kaige]], documentary filmmaker [[Julien Temple]], and the [[Polish Brothers]], among others. According to Nick Rhodes, \"Video is to us like stereo was to [[Pink Floyd]].\"<ref>Denisoff, p. 364.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"The British won out here, hands down. Next to the prosaic, foursquare appearance of the American bands, such acts as Duran Duran seemed like caviar. MTV opened up a whole new world that could not be fully apprehended over the radio. The visual angle played to the arty conceits of Britain's young style barons, suggesting something more exotic than the viewer was likely to find in the old hometown. The big Duran Duran hits, \"[[Girls on Film]]\" and \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\", were MTV favorites three months before radio began to pick up on them.

They were doing jobs at the club, John working the door and Nick deejaying for \u00a310 a night. They began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. There were many nearby nightclubs where bands such as [[the Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]] played gigs; the most significant was called [[Barbarella's]]. They went on to name the band after \"Dr. Durand Durand\", [[Milo O'Shea]]'s character from the sci-fi film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''.\n\nThe band's first singer was [[Stephen Duffy]]. Simon Colley soon joined Taylor, Rhodes and Duffy. Colley was the band's original bass player, as John Taylor was the guitarist at this point. This was the first complete line-up of the band that played live shows. For percussion, an electronic drum machine belonging to Rhodes was used. Colley left the band prior to the addition of Andy Taylor. A few guitarists were subsequently auditioned, mostly unsuccessfully, as well as a handful of vocalists after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979.<ref name=Blender>{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Odell |title=Fame Had Its Way With Us! |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=316 |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |publisher=Dennis Publishing |date=June\u2013July 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626185804/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=316 |archivedate=26 June 2007  }}</ref> Among them was Andy Wickett, a vocalist they had prior to Simon Le Bon. Wickett had a major part in the writing of \"[[Girls on Film]]\" during his tenure with the band, according to Andy Taylor's autobiography. Wickett is also featured on some of the demos that were presented to EMI. According to both Wickett's and John Taylor's websites, Wickett co-wrote an early version of the song that came to be known as \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\". Upon Colley's and Wickett's departures, the band enlisted singer Jeff Thomas and guitarist Alan Curtis, each for only a relatively brief period, before finally settling on Andy Taylor for lead guitar and Le Bon for vocals in 1980.\n\nThe meeting of drummer [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]] in 1979 with John Taylor, Rhodes and Wickett at a party, as well as the departure of Colley, led John Taylor to switch to bass. Roger Taylor then became their original (human) drummer. It was this line-up (John Taylor on bass and guitar along with Rhodes, Wickett and Roger Taylor) that made the first-ever Duran Duran studio demo tapes. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to audition after responding to an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. In May 1980, London vocalist Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the [[Rum Runner (nightclub)|Rum Runner]].<ref name=\"Green\">{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Jo-Anne|title = Your Mission, Barbarella: Find Duran Duran|journal=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|volume = 24|issue = 456 |publisher=F+W Publications Inc.|date = 16 January 1998|url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html | accessdate =1 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304091132/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html |archivedate = 4 March 2007}}</ref> The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and barmen when they were not rehearsing.\n\nIn 1980 they recorded two demo tapes and performed in clubs around [[Birmingham]] and London. Later that same year, when touring as an opening act for [[Hazel O'Connor]], the band attracted critical attention, resulting in a bidding war between the record companies [[EMI Records|EMI]] and [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]].<ref name=Malins-60>Malins (2006), p. 60</ref> \"A certain patriotism\" toward the label of [[The Beatles]] led them to sign with EMI in December.\n\nDuran Duran were amongst the earliest bands to work on their own [[remix]]es. Before the days of digital synthesisers and easy [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], they created multi-layered arrangements of their singles, sometimes recording entirely different extended performances of the songs in the studio. These \"night versions\" were generally available only on [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] to 45 rpm singles or on 12-inch club singles until the release of the compilation ''[[Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran]]'' in 1999.\n\nFrom the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as [[Kahn & Bell]] and [[Antony Price]] to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam Ant during 1980\u201381. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with [[Vivienne Westwood]] and in the 2000s with [[Giorgio Armani]]. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer [[Malcolm Garrett]] and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.<ref name=TheirStory>{{Cite book|last=De Graaf |first=Kaspar |author2=Garret, Malcolm |title=Duran Duran: Their Story |year=1982 |publisher=Cherry Lane Books |location=UK |isbn=0-86276-171-9 |page=14}}</ref>\n\nAll five members of the band were photogenic. Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in [[teen magazine]]s such as ''[[Smash Hits]]'' or ''[[Tiger Beat]]''. John Taylor once remarked that the band was \"like a box of [[Quality Street (confection)|Quality Street]] [chocolates]; everyone is someone's favourite\"<ref>De Graaf & Garret (1982), p. 15.</ref> Duran Duran later came to regret this early pin-up exposure, but at the time it helped attract national attention. In an interview with Rock Fever Superstars Magazine in early 1988, John Taylor stated:\n\n<blockquote>We used to be a very chi-chi name to drop in '79, but then the Fab Five hype started and something went wrong. Something went really wrong. That wasn't what I wanted. [...] Not that I didn't like being screamed at. At one point I really did\".<ref>Sprague, David: ''The Death of Duran Duran''. Rock Fever Superstars, issue January 1988, p.21</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1981\u20131982: Debut album===\nThe band's first album, ''[[Duran Duran (1981 album)|Duran Duran]]'' was released on the EMI label in 1981. The first single, \"[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]\", reached the United Kingdom's top 20 at number 12. A follow-up, \"[[Careless Memories]]\", stalled at Number 37. However, it was their third single, \"Girls on Film\", that attracted the most attention. The song went to Number 5 in the UK. The video featuring topless women [[mud wrestling]], [[pillow fight]]ing and stylised depictions of other [[sexual fetish]]es, was made with directing duo [[Godley & Creme]] in August.<ref name=\"Shuker 2001, p. 170\">Shuker (2001), p. 170.</ref> The video was filmed just two weeks after MTV was launched in the United States.<ref name=Malins-7>Malins (2006), pp. 77\u201379.</ref> The band expected the \"[[Girls on Film]]\" video to be played in the newer nightclubs that had video screens or on [[pay TV]] channels like the [[Playboy Channel]]. [[Kevin Godley]] explained the thinking behind it:\n\n<blockquote>We were very explicitly told by Duran Duran's management to make a very sensational and erotic piece that would be for clubs, where it would get shown uncensored just to make people take notice and talk about it.<ref name=\"Shuker 2001, p. 170\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe video was heavily edited for MTV (Music Television). The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number 3. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of [[1981 Moss Side riot|Moss Side]] and [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth]]. The band played Birmingham the day after the [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]]. Duran Duran began to achieve worldwide recognition in 1982. In May they released their second album, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'', which scored four UK Top Twenty singles with \"[[My Own Way (song)|My Own Way]]\", \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\", \"[[Save a Prayer]]\", and the title song \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\". A headlining tour of Australia, Japan, and the US was followed by a stint supporting [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] during that band's final American tour. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] declared Duran Duran her favourite band, and the band were dubbed \"the Fab Five\" by the British press, comparing them to [[the Beatles]] whose nickname was the Fab Four.<ref name=Malins-118>Malins (2006), p. 118.</ref>\n\nAt first, the ''Rio'' album did not do well in the United States. EMI in the UK had promoted Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic movement was barely known in the US, and EMI's American subsidiary [[Capitol Records]] was at a loss about how to sell them. After ''[[Carnival (ep)|Carnival]]'' (an [[Extended play|EP]] of ''Rio''{{'s}} dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the fall, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by [[David Kershenbaum]]. In June 1982, Duran Duran appeared for the first time on American television, performing \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Rio\" on ''[[Dancin' On Air]]'', the forerunner to the national hit show ''[[Dance Party USA]]''.\n\nNow promoted as a dance album, ''Rio'' was re-released in the US in November, and began to climb the American charts six months after its European success. MTV placed \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and several other Duran Duran videos into heavy rotation, pushing the single and album into the US top twenty in early 1983. The ballad \"Save a Prayer\" also did well.<ref>Denisoff (1986), pp. 364\u20135.</ref> \"The band was a natural for music television,\" noted ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. \"They may be the first rock group to ride in on a video wave.\"<ref>Denisoff (1986), p. 365.</ref> The album ultimately peaked at number 6 in the US and remained on the charts there for 129 weeks.

To satisfy America's appetite for their music,<ref name=\"Green\" /> the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single \"[[Is There Something I Should Know?]]\". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first [[chart-topper]] in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] for a show, during which artist and admirer [[Andy Warhol]] dropped by to greet them. \"Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty\", Rhodes said later, \"But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was [[Beatlemania]]. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in [[Times Square]]. We couldn't get out of the store.

(PMI MVN4911463)</ref>\n\nThe new album, ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]]'', included the late 1983 hit \"[[Union of the Snake]]\" (with the soprano sax solo by [[Andy Hamilton (pop musician)|Andy Hamilton]]). With \"Hungry Like the Wolf\", \"Rio\", \"Save a Prayer\" and \"Is There Something I Should Know?\", Duran Duran now had five US Top Twenty hits from three different albums in a single year. The band made music headlines by deciding to release the \"Union of the Snake\" video to MTV a full week before the single was released to radio. They followed up with \"[[New Moon on Monday]]\", which reached Number 9 in the UK. Their next single \"[[The Reflex]]\", taken from ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and given a significant remix overhaul by [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]] fame, became their first number one hit in the United States. \"The Reflex\" was also their second and final [[List of number-one singles (UK)|UK number one]] and was successful in numerous other countries around the world.\n\nThe band embarked on a global tour that continued throughout the first four months of 1984 including their first major stadium dates in America. A film crew led by director Russell Mulcahy followed the band closely, leading to the documentary film ''[[Sing Blue Silver]]'' and the accompanying [[concert film]] ''[[Arena (An Absurd Notion)|Arena]]''. The live album ''[[Arena (Duran Duran album)|Arena]]'' was also recorded during the tour and was released with the new studio single \"[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]\", which went to number 2 on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and won two [[Grammy Award]]s in the brand-new [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Long Form]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Short Form]] music video categories. Meanwhile, \"[[Save a Prayer]]\" gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single's B-side, taken from the concert video footage for ''Arena'' / ''[[As the Lights Go Down]]''.\n\nDuring this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], and Nick Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Hauptfuhrer|first = Fred |title = Wedding bells toll for Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, who marries an Iowa heiress|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date = 3 September 1985 |url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html | accessdate =18 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412062952/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html |archivedate = 12 April 2007}}</ref> At the end of 1984, the group were featured on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] benefit single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" along with other popular British musical acts. Simon Le Bon sang between contributions from [[George Michael]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].\n\n===1985: Side projects and Live Aid===\nEven with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] to form the rock/funk supergroup [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]], who released one LP (''So Red the Rose'') from which the single \"Election Day\" was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist [[Masami Tsuchiya]], bassist [[Mark Egan]], percussionist [[David Van Tieghem]], drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[David Gilmour]]. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\"<ref name=Blender/> The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" to the 1985 [[James Bond]] movie [[A View to a Kill|of the same name]]. This single was the first [[James Bond music|Bond theme]] to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.\n\nAs a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5&nbsp;billion TV viewers) at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on 13 July 1985 while their Bond song held the top spot on the American charts. It was not intended to be a farewell performance\u2014the band planned only to take a break after four years of non-stop touring and public appearances\u2014but the original five did not play live together again until July 2003.

An official press release was issued in April 1986 confirming his departure. In a 2004 interview with Live Daily, Roger Taylor confirmed his reasons for leaving: \"I was burned out. I think I was just exhausted. It was a very intense five years. We didn't stop. It was constant touring, constant writing, recording. We broke internationally, as well\u2014instantly, pretty well.

The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio, but after numerous delays, they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album while the disagreements were being settled.<ref name=Malins-187>Malins (2006), pp. 187\u2013190.</ref>\n\nWithout a guitarist or a drummer, the three remaining members, Le Bon, Rhodes, and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) [[Nile Rodgers]] play a few tracks on guitar, and hired [[Steve Ferrone]] to play drums while they searched for replacements. Finally in September 1986, [[Warren Cuccurullo]] (formerly of [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s band) was hired as a session guitarist. With Le Bon, Rhodes, and Taylor, he recorded the rest of the ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film ''Three to Get Ready'' chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.\n\nAlthough the song \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" went to number 2 in the US, number 7 in the UK, and album sales were strong, the band found they had lost much of the momentum and hysteria they had left behind in 1985. In the three years between the release of ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and ''Notorious'', many of their teenage fans had grown up, and the music was funkier, more mature, and less \"pop\", given the added experience of their work on Arcadia and Power Station and with other musicians. \"[[Skin Trade (song)|Skin Trade]]\" and \"[[Meet El Presidente]]\", the two subsequent singles, made the charts but fared poorly compared to the band's earlier successes. Finally in late 1987, [[Sterling Campbell]] was hired as a session drummer.\n\nSubsequently, Duran Duran struggled to escape the [[teen idol]] image and gain respect among critics with more complex music. The new serious image was not accepted at first and their popularity began to wane. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, \"In their search for musical maturity, the surviving Durans have lost a good deal of their identity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Coleman |first =Mark |title =Review of ''Notorious'' |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Publishing |date = 29 January 1987 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 | accessdate =14 May 2007 }}</ref> In contrast the New York Times said, \"Duran Duran's newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps \"Notorious\" suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|title=A Smaller Duran Duran Finds Disillusionment|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=1986-12-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Another factor was the band's dismissal of early managers, the Berrow brothers. There was no announcement of the reasons for the decision, but disagreements over money, and the brothers' involvement in Le Bon's yachting adventures (they were co-owners of ''[[Drum (yacht)|Drum]]'') were thought to have played a part.<ref name=Malins-174>Malins (2006), p. 174.</ref> Whatever the reason, Duran Duran switched managers frequently and undertook periods of self-management in the later stages of their career. In addition, EMI fired its president and went through a major corporate restructuring that summer and seemed to have lost interest in promoting the band.<ref name=Malins-186>Malins (2006), p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe next album ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988) yielded the singles \"[[I Don't Want Your Love]]\" (number 4 in the US), and \"[[All She Wants Is]]\" (the last top ten hit in the UK until 1993). The record was experimental, mixing influences from [[house music]] and [[rave]]s with Duran's atmospheric [[synthpop]] and the creative guitar work of Cuccurullo (now a full band member), as well as more mature lyrics.\n\n===1989\u20131991: Five again, ''Decade'' and ''Liberty''===\nBy the end of 1989 and at the start of the 1990s, the popularity of synthpop was fading a bit and losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]] and [[alternative rock]]. After touring for the album finished, the band regained a five-man membership as guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and tour drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] were made full members of Duran Duran.<ref>\n{{Cite book|last=D'Antonio |first=Christian |author2=Santone, Marcello |title=Duran Duran 1981/2006&nbsp;\u2013 Glam Pop Party |publisher=Editori Riuniti/Momenti Rock |location=Italy |isbn=88-359-5857-1 |date= 1 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe compilation album ''[[Decade (Duran Duran album)|Decade]]'' was released late in 1989, along with the [[megamix]] single \"[[Burning the Ground]]\", which consisted of woven snippets of the band's hits from the previous ten years, created and produced with John Jones, who began working with the band after Big Thing. The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. However, the 1990 release ''[[Liberty (Duran Duran album)|Liberty]]'' (a retreat from the experimentation of ''Big Thing'') failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles \"[[Violence of Summer|Violence of Summer (Love's Taking Over)]]\" and \"[[Serious (Duran Duran song)|Serious]]\" were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 213.</ref> Sterling Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with [[Soul Asylum]] and [[David Bowie]].

Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (No.&nbsp;4 in the UK, No.&nbsp;7 in the US). Bassist John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained [[vocal cords]]. After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nIn 1995, the band released the cover album ''[[Thank You (Duran Duran album)|Thank You]]''. Songs from ''Thank You'' included covers of [[Lou Reed]]'s \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" and [[Melle Mel]]'s \"[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]\" (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on \"Watching the Detectives\" and \"Perfect Day\" (as well as a cover of \"Jeepster\" by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's [[electronic press kit]], Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref name=Edwards />\n\n===1997\u20132000: John Taylor's departure and second trio===\nAfter the promo tour for ''Thank You'' was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Neurotic Outsiders]], and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce from De Cadenet. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, ''Medazzaland'', in January 1997, Taylor announced at the DuranCon [[fan convention]] that he was leaving the band \"for good\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Michelle|title = Duran Duran Comes Undone|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Publishing|date = 23 January 1997 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone | accessdate =18 May 2007 }}</ref> His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.\n\nFreed from some internal writing conflicts, the band returned to the studio to rewrite and re-record many of the songs on ''[[Medazzaland]]''. (Taylor's work remains on only four tracks.) This album marked a return to the layered experimentation of ''Big Thing'', with intricate guitar textures and processed vocals. The track \"[[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out of My Mind]]\" was used as the theme song for the movie ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', but the only true single to be released in the United States was the quirky \"[[Electric Barbarella]]\", which was the first single ever to be sold online.<ref>Haring, pp. 77\u20139.</ref> The video for this single, featuring a sexy robot purchased and played with by band members, had to be censored before airing on MTV, but there was little of the controversy that had surrounded \"Girls on Film\". \"Barbarella\" peaked at No.&nbsp;52 in the US in October 1997.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 246.</ref> Although ''Medazzaland'' was released in the US in October 1997, the album was never released in the UK. \"Barbarella\" was later released in the UK as a single from the 1998 ''[[Greatest (Duran Duran)|Greatest]]'' compilation album and peaked at No.&nbsp;23 on the UK chart in January 1999. The group played a set at the Princess Diana Tribute Concert on 27 June 1998 by special request of her family.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands in party tribute to Diana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/121635.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 June 1998|accessdate=18 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDuran Duran parted ways with Capitol/EMI in 1999, although the label has since used Duran Duran's back catalogue to release several compilations of remixes and rare vinyl-only B-sides. The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with Disney's [[Hollywood Records]], but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''. This slow-paced and heavy album seemed out-of-keeping with earlier band material.<ref>Malins (2006), p. 256.</ref> Rhodes' intricate production and Cuccurullo's songwriting and experimentation with guitar sounds and time signatures were not enough to hook the public, and the album did not perform well. The dreamy single \"[[Someone Else Not Me]]\" lasted barely two weeks on the radio, although its video was noted as the first to be produced entirely with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation. While supporting ''Medazzaland'' and ''Pop Trash'', Duran Duran toured with bassist [[Wes Wehmiller]] and drummer Joe Travers.\n\n===2001\u20132006: Reunion===\n[[File:Duran Duran.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran at the [[Air Canada Centre|Scotiabank Arena]], Toronto in April 2005.]]\nIn 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the ''Pop Trash'' tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger, and Andy Taylor had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.\n\nThroughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, the band worked on writing new material, initially renting a house in [[St. Tropez]] where sound engineer [[Mark Tinley]] built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and search for a new record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations.<ref name=\"Sandall\" /> The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out ''en masse'' for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played on both sides of the pond when they first got together in the early 1980s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]], only to be surprised with a [[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2004.<ref name=\"OConnell\">{{Cite news| first=John |last=O'Connell |title= Old Romantics |url= http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |work=[[Sunday Herald]] | publisher=Newsquest |date=11 April 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040508202943/http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |archivedate = 8 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duran Duran NYC 2005.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran in New York City in 2005]]\nThe pace picked up with a sold-out tour of America, Australia and New Zealand. The band played a full concert at a private tailgate party at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], their performance of \"The Wild Boys\" broadcast to millions during the pre-game show. A [[remix]] of the new track \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\" was released on many TV shows in February while magazines hailed (the modern \"Fab Five\") Duran Duran as one of the greatest bands of all time.<ref name=\"Ferber\">{{Cite news|first=Lawrence |last=Ferber |title=Wild Boys take 2 |url= http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm|work=[[Southern Voice (newspaper)|Southern Voice]]|publisher=[[Window Media]]|date=29 October 2004}}</ref> Duran Duran then celebrated their homecoming to the UK with fourteen stadium dates in April 2004, including five sold-out nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. The British press, traditionally hostile to the band, accorded the shows some very warm reviews.<ref>Malins (2006), pp. 273\u2013274</ref> Duran Duran brought along band [[Goldfrapp]] and the [[Scissor Sisters]] as alternating opening acts for this tour.<ref name=\"Sandall\" /> The last two shows were filmed, resulting in the concert DVD ''[[Live from London (Duran Duran)|Duran Duran: Live from London]]'' which was released in November.\n\nFinally, with more than thirty-five songs completed, the band signed a two-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in June, and completed the new album, now entitled ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The album was released in October 2004 and entered the UK charts at number 3 and the US charts at number 17. The first single was \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", which reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' US Dance chart in November and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, Duran Duran's highest chart position since \"A View to a Kill\" in 1985. A second single, \"[[What Happens Tomorrow]]\", debuted at No.&nbsp;11 on the UK chart in February. A 5.1 mix of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'' was created by Jeremy Wheatley for the dual-disc release of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The CD side contains the album as-is and the DVD side contains the 5.1 mix of the album in DVD Audio format along with some DVD footage and videos.\n\nAfter a world tour in early 2005, Duran Duran were presented with the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the 2005 Ivor Novello Awards. Later that summer, the band headlined the massive [[Live 8 concert, Rome]] on 2 July 2005 in the [[Circus Maximus]].\n\n===2006\u20132008: ''Red Carpet Massacre'' and Andy Taylor's second departure===\n[[File:Duran Duran Bogota 2008.JPG|thumb|right|230px|The band in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 2008]]\nIn early 2006, Duran Duran covered [[John Lennon]]'s song \"[[Instant Karma!]]\" for the ''Make Some Noise'' campaign sponsored by [[Amnesty International]]. Their version later appeared on ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' as an [[iTunes]] exclusive bonus track. They also performed at two high-profile events&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize Awards]] and the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. After a couple of weeks of songwriting in Northern California, the band began working with producer [[Michael Patterson (producer)|Michael Patterson]] in London, and continued intermittently for the next several months. At one point, they reported having had fifteen tracks nearly complete for an album tentatively titled ''[[Reportage (album)|Reportage]]'', but no further news emerged from the band for months afterward. In September, the band held meetings in New York City with [[Justin Timberlake]] and producer [[Timbaland]] with an eye to a potential collaboration and were soon reported to have completed three songs with the producer, including a song with [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref>[http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206035639/http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 October 2006, Duran Duran parted company with Andy Taylor once again. In an official announcement on their website, the band stated that an \"unworkable gulf\" had developed between them and Taylor and that \"we can no longer effectively function together\". It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book \"Wild Boy\" that tensions had arisen between the group's management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]], who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dombrown.com/ |title= Dominic Brown: Musician with Duran Duran |publisher=dombrown.com |accessdate =16 May 2006 }}</ref> After Taylor's departure, the band scrapped the ''Reportage'' album. They wrote and recorded a new album entitled ''[[Red Carpet Massacre]]'', which included the Timbaland tracks. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]] is the featured guitarist on the album.\n\nIn July 2007, the band performed twice at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Their first appearance at the stadium was the [[Concert for Diana]] which celebrated the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] almost 10 years after her death. The band performed \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", \"[[Wild Boys (song)|Wild Boys]]\" and \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |title= Concert for Diana - What happened minute by minute|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2013 }}</ref> Their second appearance was at [[Live Earth concert, London]]. On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration \"[[Falling Down (Duran Duran song)|Falling Down]]\" was released as a download single on [[iTunes]], and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on Broadway to launch the ''Red Carpet Massacre'' album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007.\n\nIn May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band [[Your Vegas]]. In June 2008, they played the [[Louvre]] in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a [[Louis XV]] drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum's artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the [[I.M. Pei]]-designed [[Louvre Pyramid|Pyramid du Louvre]]. The group's performance marked a first for the 18th century museum which had never before allowed a rock concert to occur anywhere within the grounds or buildings and another groundbreaker for Duran Duran.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, in Paris, [[Mark Ronson]] performed a unique live set with Duran Duran for an exclusive, invitation-only performance. Together, they showcased specially re-worked versions of some of Duran Duran's classic hits re-created by Ronson, along with tracks from ''Red Carpet Massacre''. Simon Le Bon also performed songs from Ronson's latest album, ''[[Version (album)|Version]]'', as one of Ronson's featured guest vocalists. Unlike the band's previous album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', ''Red Carpet Massacre'' sold poorly and received mixed responses from the music press. In 2008, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' was included in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' series.\n\n===2009\u20132012: Dominic Brown era and ''All You Need Is Now''===\n[[File:Duran Duran (6874514374).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Duran Duran at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], Australia in 2012]]\nThe band departed from Epic Records in 2009, after releasing just two albums. In early 2010, it was revealed that the band would be contributing a cover of \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" to a tribute/charity record for [[David Bowie]] called ''[[We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie|We Were So Turned On]]'' from which all profits go to [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. Other contributing artists included [[Carla Bruni]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros]], and [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]]. The album was released on 14 September 2010 on [[Manimal Vinyl]] Records. A limited edition split 7\" single with Duran Duran and [[Carla Bruni]] was also released on [[Manimal Vinyl]] in December 2010.\n\nIn November 2010, Duran Duran announced the worldwide release of their 13th studio album, entitled ''[[All You Need Is Now]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?page_id=14246/ |title=Main |publisher=Duran Duran |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> which was to be released on the band's own Tapemodern label and distributed by indie label [[S-Curve Records]]. The album, produced by the [[Grammy]] Award-winning [[Mark Ronson]] and mixed by [[Spike Stent]], was released exclusively on [[iTunes]] on 21 December 2010 and hit the No.&nbsp;1 spot on download charts in 15 countries (including the UK).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |title=ALL YOU NEED IS NOW Out in the UK on March&nbsp;21 |publisher=Duran Duran |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> The first single from the record, title track \"All You Need Is Now\", was free to download worldwide on 8 December 2010 exclusively in iTunes.

The CD features fourteen tracks, including five tracks not included with the original digital release: \"Mediterranea\", \"Other People's Lives\", \"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\", \"Diamond in the Mind\", and \"Return to Now\". In a video posted on the band's website in February 2011, Rhodes mentioned the mixing of another four tracks: \"Too Close to the Sun\", \"Early Summer Nerves\", \"This Lost Weekend\", and \"Networker Nation\". The album entered the UK chart at No.&nbsp;11 and the ''Billboard'' chart at No.&nbsp;29.\n\nOn 25 February 2011, while in Milan, Duran Duran received a Style Icons of the 20th Century Award and a key to the city, presented by the city's mayor [[Letizia Moratti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17885 |title=Receive Style Award in Milan |publisher=Duran Duran |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17883 |title=Mayor of Milan Honors Duran Duran as 20th-Century Style Icons |publisher=Duran Duran |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> On 23 March, the band performed live at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the start of the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''.

Denisoff (1986), p. 365.</ref> MTV needed showcase videos with charismatic performers. Les Garland, senior executive vice-president at MTV, said \"I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, \"You have got to see this video that's come in\". Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was the greatest video I'd ever seen\".<ref name=Blender/> The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Antigua]], creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget \"band-playing-on-a-stage\" videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" riffs on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', \"The Wild Boys\" on ''[[The Road Warrior]]'', etc.). Videos were obviously headed in this direction already, but Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.\n\nDuran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot with a professional movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or \"anything with synthesisers\". Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, [[Tears for Fears]], [[Def Leppard]] and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |title= Music Television|accessdate=17 May 2007 |author=Burns, Gary |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}</ref> The band's sun-drenched videos for \"Rio\", \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Save a Prayer\", and the surreal \"Is There Something I Should Know?\" were filmed by future movie director [[Russell Mulcahy]], who made 11 videos for the band. Duran Duran have always sought out innovative directors and techniques, even in their later years when MTV gave them little airplay. In addition to Mulcahy, they have had videos filmed by influential photographers [[Dean Chamberlain]] and [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Chinese director [[Chen Kaige]], documentary filmmaker [[Julien Temple]], and the [[Polish Brothers]], among others. According to Nick Rhodes, \"Video is to us like stereo was to [[Pink Floyd]].\"<ref>Denisoff, p. 364.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"The British won out here, hands down. Next to the prosaic, foursquare appearance of the American bands, such acts as Duran Duran seemed like caviar. MTV opened up a whole new world that could not be fully apprehended over the radio. The visual angle played to the arty conceits of Britain's young style barons, suggesting something more exotic than the viewer was likely to find in the old hometown. The big Duran Duran hits, \"[[Girls on Film]]\" and \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\", were MTV favorites three months before radio began to pick up on them. And via MTV, Duran Duran and their like have engendered an outpouring of good old-fashioned hysteria among teenage girls.\"|source=\"Anglomania: The [[Second British Invasion]]\", by Parke Puterbaugh for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', November 1983.<ref name=RS/>}}\n\nIn 1984, Duran Duran introduced video technology into their live stadium shows by being among the first acts to provide video screens above the stage.<ref name=\"DD Videos\"/> They have recorded concerts using IMAX and 360-degree panoramic \"immersive video\" cameras, with 10.2 channel audio.

The band has said that a huge amount of unreleased concert and documentary footage has been filmed over the years, which they hope can be edited and released in some form in the near future.

The three pillars of EDS originally stood for [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]] and [[christian democracy]]. Today, EDS grew into a large family which has an outlook that is various, rich and unique, represented by the name 'Democrat': Here, student organisations, political youth organisations and other centre-right organisations come together to shape modern centre-right policies for Europe.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1958, a group of Swedish students, members of the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Conservative Student League of Sweden]], travelled to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and [[West Berlin]], where they attended the annual meeting of the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]]. A cooperation between the Swedish and West German students was initiated, that was soon extended to include student organisations from the rest of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn response to increasing activities of communist organisations, the liberal-conservative and christian democratic student organisations from these countries saw a need for stronger international cooperation among democratic student organisations in Europe. When the communist [[International Union of Students]] organised the \"7th World Youth Festival\" in Vienna in 1959, christian democratic and liberal-conservative students established the organisation ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben'' (Action Committee New Life), the first international organisation of centre-right students in Europe. The new organisation distributed pins with the text \"Remember [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary 1956]]!\"\n\n[[File:Carl Bildt under nationaldagsfirande vid Skansen 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Bildt]] proposed the current name of the organisation in 1975]]\nThe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben quickly evolved into the International Student Conferences, that took place in Copenhagen and Stockholm for the first time in 1960. At the third conference, in Vienna in 1961, the International of Christian-Democrat and Conservative Students, the predecessor of the European Democrat Students, was founded. The organisation considered itself to be the \"first avantgarde fighter for the protection of the principles of liberty and individualism,\" and supported European integration and programmes for student mobility. The founding member organisations were the [[AktionsGemeinschaft|Freie \u00d6sterreichische Studentenschaft]] (Austria), the [[Conservative Students (Denmark)|Conservative Students]] (Denmark), the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (West Germany), the [[Students' League of the Conservative Party (Norway)|Students' League of the Conservative Party]] (Norway), and the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (FMSF)]]. A few months later, the [[Federation of Conservative Students|Federation of University Conservative and Unionist Associations]] (UK) and ESC (Belgium) joined.\n\nThe current name of the organisation, European Democrat Students, was adopted in 1975, after it was proposed by [[Carl Bildt]].\n\nSince 1997, EDS has been the official student organisation of the European People's Party (EPP). Full members status is held to the [[European Youth Forum]] (YFJ), the [[International Young Democrat Union]] (IYDU) and the Robert Schuman Institute. EDS is also recognised as a member association of the [[European Peoples Party]] (EPP), where EDS is one of the six EPP associations - in addition to recognition as an [[NGO]] at the [[Council of Europe]].\n\nOrganising seminars, summer and winter universities, publications, campaigns and political resolutions, EDS connects like-minded students from all over the continent and shapes European student policies as well as the debates within the EPP. In 2011, the celebrations of the 50th anniversary have been conducted in Brussels and Vienna, attracting several hundreds of members, alumni, politicians and partners.\n\nAn important shift towards a more wide vision of the world was introduced during the working year 2017-2018 with the first Study Mission organized in Latin America under the title of \"Caja Pol\u00edtica\".

The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in adulthood. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.<ref name=\"Lee, Francis S. 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Lee|first1=Francis S. |last2=Heimer|first2=Hakon |last3=Giedd|first3=Jay N. |last4=Lein|first4=Edward S. |last5=\u0160estan|first5=Nenad |last6=Weinberger|first6=Daniel R. |last7=Casey|first7=B.J. |title=Adolescent Mental Health\u2014Opportunity and Obligation |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6209 |pages=547\u2013549 |date=31 October 2014 |pmid=25359951 |doi=10.1126/science.1260497 |pmc=5069680|bibcode=2014Sci...346..547L }}</ref>  When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled.

The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families. The question would be how are these people being helped.

In another article by Stephen W. Hwang and Rochelle E Garner, they talk about the ways that the homeless are getting actually getting help. It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services was helpful in improving psychiatric symptoms.

According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania and Muse-Burke, \"[[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it believe in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness.\"<ref name=\"Richards 2010 247\"/>\n\n===Care navigation===\n{{main|Mental health care navigator}} \nMental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515\u20132523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>\n\n==Emotional issues==\n[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

Native North Americans understood mental trouble as an indication of an individual who had lost their equilibrium with the sense of place and belonging in general, and with the rest of the group in particular. In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care. Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced cultural oppression and social marginalization through the actions of European colonizers and their institutions since the earliest periods of contact. Culture contact brought with it many forms of depredation. Economic, political, and religious institutions of the European settlers all contributed to the displacement and [[oppression]] of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kirmayer |editor1-first=Laurence J. |editor2-last=Valaskakis |editor2-first=Gail Guthrie |date=2009 |title=Healing Traditions: The Mental Health of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-1523-9 |url=http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/HealingTraditions.pdf |access-date=2016-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406112447/http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/HealingTraditions.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-06 |url-status=dead }}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first officially recorded treatment practices were in 1714, when [[Quebec]] opened wards for the mentally ill.

In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye.

Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world.

As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care.

The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them.

As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services was helpful in improving psychiatric symptoms.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.

He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century.

Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems. Such disorders were almost as important a cause of years lost to disability as were infectious and parasitic diseases, which accounted for 18.5 million years lost to disability,\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mental health and physical health care, while they may seem separate, are very much connected, as these two factors determine life or death for humans. As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse.

The court started to rule in favor of the patients' will on whether they should be forced to treatment. By 1977, 650 community mental health centers were built to cover 43 percent of the population and serve 1.9 million individuals a year, and the lengths of treatment decreased from 6 months to only 23 days.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\">{{cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=C |last2=Goldman |first2=H |date=September 1991 |title=The quiet success of the national plan for the chronically mentally ill |journal=Hospital & Community Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=899\u2013905 |pmid=1743659 |doi=10.1176/ps.42.9.899}}</ref> However, issues still existed.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

The band released ''The Photograph Kills EP'' in 1995, as well as three full-length records, ''Gaslight'' (1998), ''Bastard Life or Clarity'' (2001) and ''Other Ways of Speaking'' (2003).

In 2001, the band came to the US for major press, radio and TV appearances for the ''Bastard Life or Clarity'' release and returned to Stubbs in Austin, Texas to kick off a sold out US tour with dates in Austin, [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Chicago]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[San Francisco]], [[Hollywood]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]] and the last show at the famous [[The Stone Pony|Stone Pony]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]].\n\nIn early 2005, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts as a group had \"dissolved/evolved\" with Crowe feeling his future music would take a new direction.

Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for the band, which formed in 1992. The band released ''The Photograph Kills EP'' in 1995, as well as three full-length records, ''Gaslight'' (1998), ''Bastard Life or Clarity'' (2001) and ''Other Ways of Speaking'' (2003). In 2000, TOFOG performed shows in [[London]], [[Los Angeles]] and the now famous run of shows at Stubbs in [[Austin, Texas]] which became a live DVD that was released in 2001, called ''Texas''. In 2001, the band came to the US for major press, radio and TV appearances for the ''Bastard Life or Clarity'' release and returned to Stubbs in Austin, Texas to kick off a sold out US tour with dates in Austin, [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Chicago]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[San Francisco]], [[Hollywood]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]] and the last show at the famous [[The Stone Pony|Stone Pony]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]].\n\nIn early 2005, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts as a group had \"dissolved/evolved\" with Crowe feeling his future music would take a new direction. He began a collaboration with [[Alan Doyle]] of the Canadian band [[Great Big Sea]], and with it a new band emerged: The Ordinary Fear of God which also involved some members of the previous TOFOG line-up. A new single, ''Raewyn'', was released in April 2005 and an album entitled ''My Hand, My Heart'' which was released and is available for download on iTunes. The album includes a tribute song to actor [[Richard Harris (actor)|Richard Harris]], who became Crowe's friend during the making of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.\n\nRussell Crowe & The Ordinary Fear of God set out to break the new band in by performing a successful sold out series of dates of Australia in 2005, and then in 2006, returned to the US to promote their new release ''My Hand, My Heart'' with another sold-out US Tour and major press, radio and television appearances.\nIn March 2010, Russell Crowe & The Ordinary Fear of God's version of the [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] song \"Winter Green\" was included on a new compilation album ''The Absolute Best of John Williamson: 40 Years True Blue'', commemorating the singer-songwriter's milestone of 40 years in the Australian music industry. As of May 2011, there are plans to release a new Russell Crowe & The Ordinary Fear of God recording (co-written with [[Alan Doyle]]) and for a US tour which would be the first live dates in the US since 2006.\n\nOn 2 August 2011, the third collaboration between Crowe and Doyle was released on iTunes as ''The Crowe/Doyle Songbook Vol III'', featuring nine original songs followed by their acoustic demo counterparts (for a total of 18 tracks). Danielle Spencer does guest vocals on most tracks. The release coincided with a pair of live performances at the LSPU Hall in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theindependent.ca/2011/08/04/russell-crowe-alan-doyle-the-crowedoyle-songbook-vol-iii/ |title=Russell Crowe & Alan Doyle &#124; The Crowe/Doyle Songbook, Vol. III |date=4 August 2011 |publisher=TheIndependent.ca |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> The digital album was released as download versions only on Amazon.com, iTunes, spotify.

The core storyline focuses on a plantation owned by Sintil, the local oungan (vodou priest), and run by zonbis. The zonbis, humans brought back to life from a death-like state by an oungan to work, are essentially slaves. They cannot speak, cannot think, and have no more cognitive function than is required to work the plantation. \n\nSintil controls the zonbis with the help of his daughter Siltana and a hired man named Zof\u00e8. Sintil frequently reminds Siltana that she must remember to never give the zonbis salt because if they taste it they will wake up. At the beginning of the book Siltana is happy to follow her father's directives. However when a new zonbi named Klodonis is brought to the plantation she falls in love with him and loses interest in her normal duties on the ranch. She is devestated by the fact that Klodonis is in a permenant stupor and cannot reciprocate her feelings. Her frustration buillds throughout the book until at last in desperation she gives Klodonis salt and restores him to being fully human. Unfortunately, far from being in love with her, Klodonis knocks her to the ground and immediately revives the rest of the zonbis, launching a rebellion against Sintil which eventually spreads to the village and culminates in Sintil's bloody demise.\n\nThe majority of the main plotline happens in the very end of the book. There are, however, several smaller plotlines sprinkled throughout ''D\u00e9zafi,'' which focus on other villagers in Bouan\u00e8f and how their lives are affected by Sintil\u2019s presence. J\u00e9r\u00f2m, for example, is a villager who hides in his brother\u2019s attic for almost the entirety of the book out of fear of Sintil. Another character, Gaston, uses his winnings from a lucky day at gambling to travel to Port-au-Prince. Unfortunately, once there he cannot earn enough money to make a stable living and languishes on the streets for years before attempting to return to Bouan\u00e8f just as the the revolution is taking place. However when he sees the chaotic revolution occuring in the village he turns around and walks back towards Port-au-Prince. Still another villager, J\u00e9d\u00e9yon, lives alone in an old house with his niece Rita. J\u00e9d\u00e9yon has been abandoned by his wife and family who left for the United States without him and he constantly berates and chastises Rita, who takes care of him and the house. He dies before the rebellion.\n\nThere is an additional abstract plotline which centers on a series of cock fight (d\u00e9zafis, in Haitian). When Sintil is at last apprehended and killed it is at one of these cock fights. \n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Franketienne Painting.jpg|thumb|318x318px|An untitled spiralist painting by Frank\u00e9tienne. |alt=]]\nDue to its spiralist influences, ''D\u00e9zafi'' is unconventional in structure and formatting.
