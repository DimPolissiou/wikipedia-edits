It is esteemed that between 8,000 and 10,000 Spaniards, counting the sum of their many peninsular peoples, reached Italy with Hannibal.<ref name=Daly/> The majority of them might have been still alive and serving when he returned to Carthage in 202, proving the reliability that had moved the Punics to hire them.<ref name=Guer/>\n\nThe variety and procedences of the mercenaries are not faithfully recorded, other than [[Celtiberians]], [[Lusitanians]] and [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]], which Hannibal would arrange and use for their particular talents. The first served as [[heavy cavalry]], in contrast to the lighter, skirmishing [[Numidian cavalry]], though they were also entrusted the front lines as [[infantry]] in battles like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], where they stood out for their ability to hold the line.<ref name=Daly/> Lusitanians are mentioned as having served as [[mountain troops]], possibly playing the role of both skirmishers and heavy cavalry along with Celtiberians.

Four years later, they became the first mercenaries employed by Rome, as [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was forced to hire them to retain their allegiance. According to Livy and Appian, he sent 200 to Italy in order to try to convince their countrymen in Hannibal's army into deserting. This empress had little success, but it might have helped to undermine Hannibal's trust on them.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Celtib/> In turn, Hasdrubal capitalized on his superior familiarity with Hispanic tribes to [[Bribery|bribe]] Scipio's mercenaries, who agreed to abandon the Roman general even if they would not turn against him out of principles. The result was Scipio and his brother being killed near of [[Ilorci]] in 211 BC.<ref name=Celtib/> The same year, possibly inspired by a desertion of Numidians and Iberians to [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the [[Battle of Nola (215 BC)|Battle of Nola]] in 215, Celtiberians commander Moericus and Belligenus betrayed the Punic-allied [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusians]] and joined Marcellus's entourage.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Career/> Another defection happened in [[Arpi]], where 1,000 Hispanics chose to join the Roman side,<ref name=Career/> although this might have been an exchange to get 5,000 Africans out of the city and back with Hannibal.<ref name=Guer/> Nevertheless, those seem to have been exceptions to the Hispanic mercenaries's loyalty. They generally held their Carthaginian masters in high regard, addressing them as their [[Commander-in-chief|supreme commander]]s, and in many cases, like the defeats of Hasdrubal and Hanno, they died in suicide battle for them.<ref name=Daly/> Hannibal considered his peninsular fighters to be among his most valuable forces, almost at the level of his African compatriots, and contrasting especially with the more expendable and undisciplined [[Gauls]] and [[Ligurians]].<ref name=Guer/>\n\nIn 209 BC, after gathering large contingents of Celtiberian and Cantabrian mercenaries, Hasdrubal departed Hispania for Italy in order to meet with Hannibal. His army arrived in 207 only to be discovered and defeated in the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where [[Hasdrubal]] was killed among the Spaniards, the last Punic forces to fall. Some Celtiberians managed to cut their way out and reach Hannibal.<ref name=Celtib/> The same year, generals [[Mago Barca]] and Hanno moved to Celtiberia to collect another army, but a new Roman attack, this time by [[Marcus Junius Silanus (praetor 212 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]] behind local guides and under orders from [[Scipio Africanus]], ended it before they could depart too.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/> This would be a tough decision for the Roman side, as their intrusion in the Celtiberians's lands would put them against Rome again, making them join [[Indibilis and Mandonius]]'s Iberian [[Ilergetes|Ilergete]] revolt.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/> Anyhow, Mago managed to flee with 2,000 survivors to Gadir. After the [[Battle of Ilipa]], he sent a prefect also named Hanno to gather yet another Celtiberian contingent, but the resultant [[Battle of the Guadalquivir (206 BC)|Battle of the Guadalquivir]] ended the third and final attempt to maintain a large scale native army.<ref name=Celtib/> The remnant mercenaries, now 12,000 after the last levies,<ref name=Guer/> were placed by Mago in an improvised fleet, which finally sailed towards Italy after having unsuccessfully retake Cartagena, not without hiring other 2,000 Balearics on the way.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/>\n\nThe last great deployments of peninsular mercenaries in the Second Punic War were in the territorial defense of Carthage. Taking command of 4000 Celtiberians from the Ilergete revolt previously sent by Mago, [[Hasdrubal Gisco]] and [[Syphax]] clashed with the invading Romans led by Scipio in the [[Battle of the Great Plains]]. The encounter was bitter to both the Celtiberians and Scipio, as the former had shown mercy to them in Hispania despite their allegiance to Indibilis and Mandonius, so the mercenaries knew the Roman general would not spare them a second time. Consequently, when the mercenaries found themselves being characteristically the last Carthaginian force standing in the battle, most chose to fight to the end and died in their posts.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Celtib/> There were further attempts to bring new Spanish fighters to Carthage, but the [[Saguntines]] captured the Carthaginian recruiters and sold them to Rome.<ref name=Celtib/> In 202 BC, Hannibal brought the remnant of his veteran mercenaries from Italy and united them to those of Mago, who had died in the sea while returning to Africa. They faced Scipio again in the [[Battle of Zama]], being ultimately defeated and witnessing the end of the war. The loss of Carthage saw the end of the Punic mercenary tradition, as it was specifically written among the conditions imposed by Rome.\n\n==2nd-1st centuries BC==\nDespite the withdrawal of Carthage from Hispania, the peninsular custom of mercenary life survived the same. Between 197 and 195 BC, the Turdetanians employed 30,000 Celtiberians as elite troops during the Iberian revolt, while in 147 BC the Roman themselves sent them unsuccessfully against the Lusitanians led by [[Viriathus]]. [[Julius Caesar]] would also use Balearic slingers in the [[Gallic Wars]].<ref>[[Bellum Gallicum]], 2.7</ref>\n\n==Early Roman Empire==\nThe employment of Balearic slingers as mercenaries continued in the [[Imperial Roman army]]. The value of light infantry skilled in the use of stone missile throwing by slings was recognised as late as the 4th century AD, although by this date their recruitment basis had been extended from beyond Iberia and the Belaric Islands.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gabriele|last=Esposito|page=79|title=The Late Roman Army|ISBN=978-0-9963657-9-6}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient history of the  Iberian Peninsula]]\n[[Category:Ancient mercenaries|Iberian peninsula mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Mercenary units and formations of antiquity]]\n[[Category:Military history of ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Military history of Europe]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Granite statue of a Lusitanian Warrior, dating from the 1st century AD, National Archaeology Museum, Lisbon (12691953623).jpg|thumb|160px|Statue of an ancient Lusitanian warrior from [[Lisbon, Portugal]].]]\n[[Mercenary]] life is recorded as a custom of [[Iron Age]] [[Spain]], particularly in the central area of the [[Iberian peninsula]].

His son [[Hannibal]] continued his effort after his death with plans to lead an expeditionary army to [[Italy]]. As mentioned earlier, in this case it is not easy to differentiate true partisans from forced vassals either, except whenever their procedence didn't equate with conquered regions, as apparently Hannibal only made a distinction out of his Spaniards about the topic of their allegiance.<ref name=Hina/> In 218, before departing from [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], he sent 16,000 [[Bastetani]], [[Oretani]] and [[Olcades|Olcade]] serfs to garrison Carthage in exchange for 15,200 African javelin throwers, thus preventing any possible rebellion of any of them due to the distance from their home lands.<ref name=Career>{{cite web | url= http://interclassica.um.es/var/plain/storage/original/application/d7c9c9af8e5785a9facebb73950aff19.pdf | title= Las guerras en Hispania y su importancia para la carrera militar de An\u00edbal, de Escipi\u00f3n el Africano, de Mario, de Cneo Pompeyo, de Sertorio, de Afranio, de Terencio Var\u00f3n, de Julio C\u00e9sar y de Augusto | author = J.

It is esteemed that between 8,000 and 10,000 Spaniards, counting the sum of their many peninsular peoples, reached Italy with Hannibal.<ref name=Daly/> The majority of them might have been still alive and serving when he returned to Carthage in 202, proving the reliability that had moved the Punics to hire them.<ref name=Guer/>\n\nThe variety and procedences of the mercenaries are not faithfully recorded, other than [[Celtiberians]], [[Lusitanians]] and [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]], which Hannibal would arrange and use for their particular talents. The first served as [[heavy cavalry]], in contrast to the lighter, skirmishing [[Numidian cavalry]], though they were also entrusted the front lines as [[infantry]] in battles like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], where they stood out for their ability to hold the line.<ref name=Daly/> Lusitanians are mentioned as having served as [[mountain troops]], possibly playing the role of both skirmishers and heavy cavalry along with Celtiberians. Their combined force, composed of around 2,000 horsemen, was praised by Livy over their more numerous and famous Numidian homologues.<ref name=Arma/><ref name=Daly/> Finally, Balearics, ranging between 1,000 and 2,000, excelled as skirmishing infantry, being armed with famed [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] capable to throw heavy shot over their enemies.<ref name=Daly/> [[Silius Italicus]] speaks of even more tribes in the army, including [[Vettones]], [[Gallaeci]]ans (combined with the Lusitanians in a single battalion), [[Cantabri]]ans, [[Astures]], and [[Vascones]],<ref>[[Silius Italicus]], ''[[Punica (poem)|Punica]]''</ref> although authors have doubted of such diversity.<ref name=Hina/> In any case, Celtiberians and Lusitanians probably were the main bodies of mercenaries, as Hannibal's spiel addressing them before the [[Battle of Ticinus]] attests.<ref name=Celtib>{{cite web | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286165920_Los_celtiberos_y_la_ubicacion_de_Celtiberia_en_el_relato_de_la_segunda_Guerra_Punica_de_Tito_Livio | title= Los celt\u00edberos y la ubicaci\u00f3n de Celtiberia en el relato de la Segunda Guerra P\u00fanica, de Tito Livio | author = Seraf\u00edn Olcoz Yanguas, Manuel Medrano Marqu\u00e9s | publisher= Espacio, Tiempo y Forma | accessdate= | language= Spanish}}</ref>\n[[File:Espada celt\u00edbera de antenas de la Necr\u00f3polis de de La Requijada de Gormaz - M.A.N.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A Celtiberian ''gladius hispaniensis'', used by Hannibal's mercenaries and adopted by the Romans.]]\nOther Celtiberians fought against Carthage after their pact with Rome, defeating [[Hasdrubal Barca]]'s forces in 217 BC. Four years later, they became the first mercenaries employed by Rome, as [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was forced to hire them to retain their allegiance. According to Livy and Appian, he sent 200 to Italy in order to try to convince their countrymen in Hannibal's army into deserting. This empress had little success, but it might have helped to undermine Hannibal's trust on them.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Celtib/> In turn, Hasdrubal capitalized on his superior familiarity with Hispanic tribes to [[Bribery|bribe]] Scipio's mercenaries, who agreed to abandon the Roman general even if they would not turn against him out of principles. The result was Scipio and his brother being killed near of [[Ilorci]] in 211 BC.<ref name=Celtib/> The same year, possibly inspired by a desertion of Numidians and Iberians to [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the [[Battle of Nola (215 BC)|Battle of Nola]] in 215, Celtiberians commander Moericus and Belligenus betrayed the Punic-allied [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusians]] and joined Marcellus's entourage.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Career/> Another defection happened in [[Arpi]], where 1,000 Hispanics chose to join the Roman side,<ref name=Career/> although this might have been an exchange to get 5,000 Africans out of the city and back with Hannibal.<ref name=Guer/> Nevertheless, those seem to have been exceptions to the Hispanic mercenaries's loyalty. They generally held their Carthaginian masters in high regard, addressing them as their [[Commander-in-chief|supreme commander]]s, and in many cases, like the defeats of Hasdrubal and Hanno, they died in suicide battle for them.<ref name=Daly/> Hannibal considered his peninsular fighters to be among his most valuable forces, almost at the level of his African compatriots, and contrasting especially with the more expendable and undisciplined [[Gauls]] and [[Ligurians]].<ref name=Guer/>\n\nIn 209 BC, after gathering large contingents of Celtiberian and Cantabrian mercenaries, Hasdrubal departed Hispania for Italy in order to meet with Hannibal. His army arrived in 207 only to be discovered and defeated in the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where [[Hasdrubal]] was killed among the Spaniards, the last Punic forces to fall. Some Celtiberians managed to cut their way out and reach Hannibal.<ref name=Celtib/> The same year, generals [[Mago Barca]] and Hanno moved to Celtiberia to collect another army, but a new Roman attack, this time by [[Marcus Junius Silanus (praetor 212 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]] behind local guides and under orders from [[Scipio Africanus]], ended it before they could depart too.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/> This would be a tough decision for the Roman side, as their intrusion in the Celtiberians's lands would put them against Rome again, making them join [[Indibilis and Mandonius]]'s Iberian [[Ilergetes|Ilergete]] revolt.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/> Anyhow, Mago managed to flee with 2,000 survivors to Gadir. After the [[Battle of Ilipa]], he sent a prefect also named Hanno to gather yet another Celtiberian contingent, but the resultant [[Battle of the Guadalquivir (206 BC)|Battle of the Guadalquivir]] ended the third and final attempt to maintain a large scale native army.<ref name=Celtib/> The remnant mercenaries, now 12,000 after the last levies,<ref name=Guer/> were placed by Mago in an improvised fleet, which finally sailed towards Italy after having unsuccessfully retake Cartagena, not without hiring other 2,000 Balearics on the way.<ref name=Celtib/><ref name=Career/>\n\nThe last great deployments of peninsular mercenaries in the Second Punic War were in the territorial defense of Carthage. Taking command of 4000 Celtiberians from the Ilergete revolt previously sent by Mago, [[Hasdrubal Gisco]] and [[Syphax]] clashed with the invading Romans led by Scipio in the [[Battle of the Great Plains]]. The encounter was bitter to both the Celtiberians and Scipio, as the former had shown mercy to them in Hispania despite their allegiance to Indibilis and Mandonius, so the mercenaries knew the Roman general would not spare them a second time. Consequently, when the mercenaries found themselves being characteristically the last Carthaginian force standing in the battle, most chose to fight to the end and died in their posts.<ref name=Hina/><ref name=Celtib/> There were further attempts to bring new Spanish fighters to Carthage, but the [[Saguntines]] captured the Carthaginian recruiters and sold them to Rome.<ref name=Celtib/> In 202 BC, Hannibal brought the remnant of his veteran mercenaries from Italy and united them to those of Mago, who had died in the sea while returning to Africa. They faced Scipio again in the [[Battle of Zama]], being ultimately defeated and witnessing the end of the war. The loss of Carthage saw the end of the Punic mercenary tradition, as it was specifically written among the conditions imposed by Rome.\n\n==2nd-1st centuries BC==\nDespite the withdrawal of Carthage from Hispania, the peninsular custom of mercenary life survived the same. Between 197 and 195 BC, the Turdetanians employed 30,000 Celtiberians as elite troops during the Iberian revolt, while in 147 BC the Roman themselves sent them unsuccessfully against the Lusitanians led by [[Viriathus]]. [[Julius Caesar]] would also use Balearic slingers in the [[Gallic Wars]].<ref>[[Bellum Gallicum]], 2.7</ref>\n\n==Early Roman Empire==\nThe employment of Balearic slingers as mercenaries continued in the [[Imperial Roman army]]. The value of light infantry skilled in the use of stone missile throwing by slings was recognised as the late 4th century AD, although by this date their recruitment basis had been extended from beyond Iberia and the Belaric Islands.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gabriele|last=Esposito|page=79|title=The Late Roman Army|ISBN=978-0-9963657-9-6}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient history of the  Iberian Peninsula]]\n[[Category:Ancient mercenaries|Iberian peninsula mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Mercenary units and formations of antiquity]]\n[[Category:Military history of ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Military history of Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Buistr", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly Roman Empire", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenaries_of_the_ancient_Iberian_Peninsula"}

Markville S.S. was officially opened in late fall of 1990. The school opened with Grades 9, 10, and some Grade 11 students, with Grades 11 and 12 age students being allowed stay at either Unionville High School or Markham District High School.

The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970.

It took place in [[Tel&nbsp;Aviv]], [[Israel]], following [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\". It was the third time Israel had hosted the contest, having previously done so in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. However, this was the first time Israel hosted the contest outside of Jerusalem. Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and host broadcaster [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation]] (IPBC), the contest was held at [[Expo Tel Aviv]], and consisted of two semi-finals on 14 and 16 May, and the final on 18 May 2019.<ref name=\"Host city\">{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/tel-aviv-host-city-eurovision-2019|title=Tel Aviv to host Eurovision 2019! \u2013 Eurovision Song Contest Israel 2019|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=13 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218213320/https://eurovision.tv/story/tel-aviv-host-city-eurovision-2019|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The three live shows were hosted by [[Erez Tal]], [[Bar Refaeli]], [[Assi Azar]] and [[Lucy Ayoub]].\n\nForty-one countries took part in the contest; {{Esccnty|Bulgaria}} and {{Esccnty|Ukraine}} were absent. Bulgaria did not enter because members of its delegation had been moved to other projects. Ukraine had originally planned to participate in the contest but withdrew because of the controversy surrounding their national final.\n\nThe winner was the {{esccnty|Netherlands|y=2019}} with the song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\", performed by [[Duncan Laurence]] who also wrote it with Joel Sj\u00f6\u00f6, Wouter Hardy and Will Knox. This was the {{esccnty|Netherlands}}' fifth victory in the contest, following their wins in {{escyr|1957}}, {{escyr|1959}}, {{escyr|1969}} and {{escyr|1975}}. In a similar way to [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], the overall winner won neither the jury vote, which was won by North Macedonia, nor the televote, which was won by Norway, with the Netherlands placing third and second respectively. Italy, Russia, Switzerland and Sweden rounded out the top five. Further down the table, {{esccnty|North Macedonia}} and {{esccnty|San Marino}} achieved their best results to date, finishing seventh and nineteenth, respectively. This was North Macedonia's first Top 10 finish since joining the competition in {{escyr|1998}}. {{Esccnty|Israel}} finished in 23rd place in the final, making it the fourth time since {{escyr|2015}} the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nThere was an error in the voting at the contest: a wrongful counting of the jury votes by the Belarusian delegation caused the televised results to be amended three days later. The discrepancy was not large enough to change the order of the originally announced top four in the final result, which combines the jury voting and televoting by the public,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48375560|title=Last-place UK does even worse in Eurovision|date=23 May 2019|website=BBC.com |access-date=23 May 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523063108/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48375560|archive-date=23 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> but this update saw North Macedonia as the new jury winner instead of Sweden as shown on TV; there were also minor changes in lower positions.\n\nThe EBU reported the contest had an audience of 182 million viewers in 40 European markets, which saw an increase by two percent in the 15\u201324 year old age range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebu.ch/news/2019/05/182-million-tune-in-to-64th-eurovision-song-contest-as-young-audience-numbers-surge|title=182 million tune in to 64th Eurovision Song Contest as young audience numbers surge|access-date=28 May 2019|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528104657/https://www.ebu.ch/news/2019/05/182-million-tune-in-to-64th-eurovision-song-contest-as-young-audience-numbers-surge|archive-date=28 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Location==\n{{details|topic=the host city|Tel Aviv}}\nThe 2019 contest took place in [[Israel]] for the third time, having been held there in {{Escyr|1979}} and {{Escyr|1999}}, and followed the country's victory at the 2018 edition with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\", performed by [[Netta Barzilai]].<ref name=\"hosting\">{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Itay|last2=Tucker|first2=Nati|last3=Lerner|first3=Davide|title=Israel's Netta Wins 2018 Eurovision Song Contest With 'Toy'|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-netta-wins-201eurovision-song-contest-with-toy-1.6077083|accessdate=16 May 2018|agency=[[Haaretz]]|date=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Venue===\n[[File:Expo Tel Aviv - Pavilion 2 - 20190227 13.jpg|thumb|left|Pavilion 2 of Expo Tel Aviv]]\nThe contest took place at [[Expo Tel Aviv]]'s 7,300-seat<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Few-seats-sky-high-prices-Eurovision-ticket-details-released-581082|title=FEW SEATS, SKY-HIGH PRICES: EUROVISION TICKET DETAILS RELEASED|website=[[jpost.com]]|access-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220004040/https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Few-seats-sky-high-prices-Eurovision-ticket-details-released-581082|archive-date=20 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> congress and convention centre in \"Bitan 2\" (Pavilion 2), which was inaugurated in January 2015.<ref name=\"Host city\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citmagazine.com/article/1330649/pavilion-2-opens-tel-aviv-convention-center|title=Pavilion 2 opens at Tel Aviv Convention Center|accessdate=25 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626001512/https://www.citmagazine.com/article/1330649/pavilion-2-opens-tel-aviv-convention-center|archive-date=26 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> <!--Located on [[Israel Rokach|Rokach Boulevard]] in northern [[Tel Aviv]], the convention centre serves as a venue for many events, including [[concert]]s, [[exhibition]]s, [[trade fair]]s, and [[conference]]s.

In these results, Israel, which did not receive points from any other jury during the Grand Final, received 12 points from Belarus.\n\nHowever, Twitter user @euro_bruno noted on May 19 that it appeared an incorrect substitute Belarusian result was announced during the broadcast of the Grand Final four days earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|title=Major error uncovered in Belarusian jury vote?|date=2019-05-19|website=ESCXTRA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522103141/https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The mistake was confirmed in a statement issued by the EBU three days later, on 22 May 2019. According to the statement, the EBU \"discovered that due to a human error an incorrect aggregated result was used. This had no impact on the calculation of points derived from televoting across the 41 participating countries and the overall winner and Top 4 songs of the Contest remain unchanged. To respect both the artists and EBU Members which took part, [they wished] to correct the final results in accordance with the rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/ebu-issues-statement-on-eurovision-2019-grand-final-result|title=EBU Issues Statement on the 2019 Grand Final Result|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=25 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524003358/https://eurovision.tv/story/ebu-issues-statement-on-eurovision-2019-grand-final-result|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe error, a reversal of the Belarusian aggregated votes, led to the bottom ten countries receiving points instead of the top ten. Malta, which had been incorrectly ranked last, would receive Belarus' 12 jury points, and Israel would end up with [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Scoring no points|no jury points]]. The corrected point totals also changed some rankings: Sweden finished fifth overall instead of Norway, Belarus finished 24th overall instead of Germany, and North Macedonia won the jury vote instead of Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|title=Major error uncovered in Belarusian jury vote|last=Wedell|first=Nathan|date=19 May 2019|publisher=escXtra|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522103141/https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2019/05/20/eurovision-2019-were-the-jury-votes-belarus-wrong-order/239297/|title=Eurovision 2019: Were the aggregated jury votes from Belarus given in the wrong order?|last=Gallagher|first=Robyn|date=20 May 2019|publisher=Wiwibloggs}}</ref>\n\nThe mistake made by the EBU and their voting partner was widely panned by the press.

If his and Hedlund's votes were reversed, it would have had no impact on the result other than minor differences in the number of points received by each country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.15min.lt/vardai/naujiena/eurovizija/isgirdes-apie-galimai-supainiotus-rusijos-komisijos-balus-jurijus-veklenko-nesisieloja-yra-kaip-yra-1058-1147050|title=I\u0161gird\u0119s apie galimai supainiotus Rusijos komisijos balus Jurijus Veklenko nesisieloja: \"Yra, kaip yra\"|website=15min.lt |accessdate=25 May 2019|date=20 May 2019|language=Lithuanian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525104646/https://www.15min.lt/vardai/naujiena/eurovizija/isgirdes-apie-galimai-supainiotus-rusijos-komisijos-balus-jurijus-veklenko-nesisieloja-yra-kaip-yra-1058-1147050|archive-date=25 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2019/05/28/russia-juror-ranking-backwards-costs-lithuania-place-in-the-final-of-eurovision-2019/|title=Russia: Juror Ranking Backwards Costs Lithuania Place in the Final of Eurovision 2019?|date=28 May 2019|publisher=Eurovoix|last=Granger|first=Anthony|access-date=19 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606143940/https://eurovoix.com/2019/05/28/russia-juror-ranking-backwards-costs-lithuania-place-in-the-final-of-eurovision-2019/|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis was the second year in which a juror accidentally submitted their votes backwards.

We know, but we're just not ready to act\". This was interpreted as a reference to the conflict. During \"Future\" two dancers\u2014one wearing an Israeli the second a Palestine flag on the back of their costumes\u2014 were seen holding each other when guest vocalist [[Quavo]] sang the lyrics: \"Not everyone is coming to the future, not everyone is learning from the past\". Madonna said the use of Israeli and Palestinian flags was not a pro-Palestine demonstration, but a call for unity and peace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/madonna-makes-call-for-israel-palestine-unity-at-eurovision|title=Madonna makes call for Israel-Palestine unity at Eurovision|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=18 May 2019|work=[[The Observer]]|access-date=18 May 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519005957/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/madonna-makes-call-for-israel-palestine-unity-at-eurovision|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhile receiving their points from the televotes, members of the Icelandic entry [[Hatari (band)|Hatari]] were seen showing banners that included the [[Flag of Palestine|Palestinian flag]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/europe/iceland-eurovision-palestine-intl/index.html|title=Iceland's Eurovision entry Hatari holds up Palestinian flag during contest|last=Picheta|first=Rob|website=[[CNN]]|access-date=18 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519021043/https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/europe/iceland-eurovision-palestine-intl/index.html|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/18/iceland-use-eurovision-song-contest-protest-israeli-occupation-palestinian-territories-9598077/|title=Iceland use Eurovision to protest against the Israeli occupation of Palestine|date=18 May 2019|website=Metro|language=en-US|access-date=18 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519124251/https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/18/iceland-use-eurovision-song-contest-protest-israeli-occupation-palestinian-territories-9598077/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> There had previously been concerns that the self-described [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] group would use their performance to protest the Israeli occupation of Palestine,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/icelandic-bondage-band-shock-eurovision-2st02mfv6|title=Icelandic bondage band shock Eurovision|date=18 May 2019|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=18 May 2019|language=en|issn=0140-0460|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518004138/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/icelandic-bondage-band-shock-eurovision-2st02mfv6|archive-date=18 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the band had previously received warnings from the EBU about statements they had made prior to the contest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://grapevine.is/news/2019/05/16/hatari-have-reached-the-limits-of-ebus-patience-over-repeated-political-statements/ |title=Hatari Have \"Reached The Limits\" Of EBU's Patience Over Repeated Political Statements |first=Andie |last=Fontaine |date=16 May 2019 |website=[[The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine]] |access-date=17 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517063602/https://grapevine.is/news/2019/05/16/hatari-have-reached-the-limits-of-ebus-patience-over-repeated-political-statements/ |archive-date=17 May 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> After the contest, the EBU said that \"the consequences of this action will be discussed by the Reference Group (the Contest's executive board) after the Contest\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/0518/1050338-madonna/ |title=Madonna controversy as flags feature during Eurovision performance|date=19 May 2019 |website=rte.ie |accessdate=19 May 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519052312/https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/0518/1050338-madonna/ |archivedate= 19 May 2019}}</ref> Hatari subsequently announced a collaboration with Palestinian artist [[Bashar Murad]] for their next single.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/20/icelands-hatari-confirm-collaboration-queer-palestinian-artist-eurovision-protest-9606327/ |title=Iceland\u2019s Hatari confirm collaboration with queer Palestinian artist after Eurovision protest |last=Kelly |first=Emma |date=20 May 2019 |website=metro.co.uk |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523075326/https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/20/icelands-hatari-confirm-collaboration-queer-palestinian-artist-eurovision-protest-9606327/ |archive-date=23 May 2019 |access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other awards==\nIn addition to the main winner's trophy, the [[Marcel Bezen\u00e7on Awards]] and the [[Barbara Dex Award]] were contested during the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest.

It was the third time Israel had hosted the contest, having previously done so in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. However, this was the first time Israel hosted the contest outside of Jerusalem. Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and host broadcaster [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation]] (IPBC), the contest was held at [[Expo Tel Aviv]], and consisted of two semi-finals on 14 and 16 May, and the final on 18 May 2019.<ref name=\"Host city\">{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/tel-aviv-host-city-eurovision-2019|title=Tel Aviv to host Eurovision 2019! \u2013 Eurovision Song Contest Israel 2019|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=13 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218213320/https://eurovision.tv/story/tel-aviv-host-city-eurovision-2019|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The three live shows were hosted by [[Erez Tal]], [[Bar Refaeli]], [[Assi Azar]] and [[Lucy Ayoub]].\n\nForty-one countries took part in the contest; {{Esccnty|Bulgaria}} and {{Esccnty|Ukraine}} were absent. Bulgaria did not enter because members of its delegation had been moved to other projects. Ukraine had originally planned to participate in the contest but withdrew because of the controversy surrounding their national final.\n\nThe winner was the {{esccnty|Netherlands|y=2019}} with the song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\", performed by [[Duncan Laurence]] who also wrote it with Joel Sj\u00f6\u00f6, Wouter Hardy and Will Knox. This was the {{esccnty|Netherlands}}' fifth victory in the contest, following their wins in {{escyr|1957}}, {{escyr|1959}}, {{escyr|1969}} and {{escyr|1975}}. In a similar way to [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], the overall winner won neither the jury vote, which was won by North Macedonia, nor the televote, which was won by Norway, with the Netherlands placing third and second respectively. Italy, Russia, Switzerland and Sweden rounded out the top five.

To comply with the contest's voting regulations, the EBU worked with its voting partner, Digame, to create a substitute aggregated result (calculated based on the results of other countries with similar voting records), which was approved by voting monitor [[Ernst & Young]], to determine the Belarusian jury votes for the Grand Final. In these results, Israel, which did not receive points from any other jury during the Grand Final, received 12 points from Belarus.\n\nHowever, Twitter user @euro_bruno noted on May 19 that it appeared an incorrect substitute Belarusian result was announced during the broadcast of the Grand Final four days earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|title=Major error uncovered in Belarusian jury vote?|date=2019-05-19|website=ESCXTRA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522103141/https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The mistake was confirmed in a statement issued by the EBU three days later, on 22 May 2019. According to the statement, the EBU \"discovered that due to a human error an incorrect aggregated result was used. This had no impact on the calculation of points derived from televoting across the 41 participating countries and the overall winner and Top 4 songs of the Contest remain unchanged. To respect both the artists and EBU Members which took part, [they wished] to correct the final results in accordance with the rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/ebu-issues-statement-on-eurovision-2019-grand-final-result|title=EBU Issues Statement on the 2019 Grand Final Result|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=25 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524003358/https://eurovision.tv/story/ebu-issues-statement-on-eurovision-2019-grand-final-result|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe error, a reversal of the Belarusian aggregated votes, led to the bottom ten countries receiving points instead of the top ten. Malta, which had been incorrectly ranked last, would receive Belarus' 12 jury points, and Israel would end up with [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Scoring no points|no jury points]]. The corrected point totals also changed some rankings: Sweden finished fifth overall instead of Norway, Belarus finished 24th overall instead of Germany, and North Macedonia won the jury vote instead of Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|title=Major error uncovered in Belarusian jury vote|last=Wedell|first=Nathan|date=19 May 2019|publisher=escXtra|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522103141/https://escxtra.com/2019/05/19/major-error-belarus-jury-vote-eurovision-final/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2019/05/20/eurovision-2019-were-the-jury-votes-belarus-wrong-order/239297/|title=Eurovision 2019: Were the aggregated jury votes from Belarus given in the wrong order?|last=Gallagher|first=Robyn|date=20 May 2019|publisher=Wiwibloggs}}</ref>\n\nThe mistake made by the EBU and their voting partner was widely panned by the press.

We know, but we're just not ready to act\". This was interpreted as a reference to the conflict. During \"Future\" two dancers\u2014one wearing an Israeli the second a Palestine flag on the back of their costumes\u2014 were seen holding each other when guest vocalist [[Quavo]] sang the lyrics: \"Not everyone is coming to the future, not everyone is learning from the past\".

These distribution rights are now held by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]] (for live-action TV series and post-9/2005 live-action films) and [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]] (for earlier live-action films).\n\nUntil May 2009, CTD distributed the Paramount Pictures library on television.  By then, CBS also dropped the name \"Paramount\" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios.  Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta.
