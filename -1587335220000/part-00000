A powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]], twenty years ago Atrix Wolfe turned the King of the Wood into a terrible Hunter in order to force the invading Kardeth army, which threatened the kingdoms of Pelucir and Chaumenard, to retreat. The Hunter massacred not only the invaders, but the Pelucir forces as well, including the king. During the creation of the Hunter, the daughter of the King and Queen of the Wood, Saro (pronounced the same as \"sorrow\", a term which is a recurring motif of the book), disappeared.\n\nTalis, the prince of Pelucir, is attending mage's school at Chaumenard when he discovers a book by an unknown author. Though it is only a beginner's spellbook, he is strangely fascinated by it and takes it with him when his brother Burne, the king, summons him back to Pelucir. Experimenting with the book, he discovers that none of the spells do what they say, and are actually codes for more dangerous spells. He takes his studies with the book into the keep which the Kardeth army besieged in the incident 20 years before, and which has been haunted and abandoned ever since. In the [[medieval cuisine|kitchens of the castle]], a scullery maid named Saro is [[Muteness|mute]], and thus interacts more with the pots and pans than other people. She is tasked with bringing Talis's meals to the keep, since her lack of knowledge of the world outside the kitchen makes her the only one not afraid of the keep's ghosts. When he meets Saro, he notices that her facial features seem to constantly shift, preventing her from being recognized. This is the first time Saro has had someone actually look at her, rather than seeing her only for her occupation.\n\nWarned by a dream, Atrix Wolfe attempts to retrieve a spellbook he wrote shortly after the incident 20 years ago, but finds it has moved from where he hid it. He discovers Talis took it back to Pelucir, and arrives at the keep just in time to save Talis from the Hunter. While Talis is fleeing from the Hunter, the Queen of the Wood takes him into the magical world of the wood. She says she will only allow him to return to the human world if he brings her Atrix Wolfe, who she needs to find Saro. She cannot get Atrix herself because neither he nor she can pass through the barrier between the human world and the world of the wood. Talis brings her Atrix Wolfe, who agrees to find Saro, and the Queen returns Talis to his world.\n\nHaving become enamored of the Queen of the Wood, Talis resolves to find Saro for her before Atrix Wolfe. Though Talis has never been properly introduced to her, he intuits that the scullery maid is Saro, her muteness and ever-changing face being a spell which has kept the Queen from finding her. He brings her to the Queen. The Hunter finds them all there and shoots an arrow into Talis. The threat to his life ignites Saro into breaking the spell upon herself, remembering who she is and crying out to her father, ending her muteness. This in turn bring Ilyos back to himself.\n\nIlyos, however, has been through so much that he cannot return to his life as the Queen's consort. In order to protect the Queen's world, he has Atrix Wolfe turn him into one of the trees of the Wood. As partial penance for having caused the death of Burne and Talis's father, Atrix Wolfe remains in Pelucir to tutor Talis in magic. Talis is surprised when Saro returns to Pelucir, and they begin to become acquainted. She says that she no longer felt at home in the world of the Wood, and that he is the only one who can understand her, being the only other person to have spent time in both worlds.\n\n==Nominations==\n*1996 [[Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[Wild hunt]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Patricia A.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

[[Russia]] annexed [[Lake Issyk Kul]] in north east [[Kyrgyzstan]] of off [[China]] in the early 1860s, lands of [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], [[Khanate of Khiva]], [[Emirate of Bukhara]] in the second half of [[19th century|1800s]].\n\nEmerging from the Russian Empire following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, the USSR was a union of several Soviet republics, but the synecdoche Russia \u2014 after its largest and dominant constituent state \u2014 continued to be commonly used throughout the state's existence. ''Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic'' (initially Turkestan Socialist Federative Republic) (April 30, 1918 \u2013 October 27, 1924) was created from the [[Turkestan Krai]] of [[Imperial Russia]]. Its capital was [[Tashkent]], population about 5,000,000.\n\nBritish and Persian forces briefly tried to reach [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]] and the Turkmen port of [[Krasnovodsk]]. [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], [[Samarkand]], [[Kokand]], [[Dushanbe]] and the former [[Trans-Caspian province]] would see various anti-Bolshevik risings over the next few years.\n\nIn 1924, it was split into [[Tajik ASSR]] (now [[Tajikistan]]), [[Turkmen SSR]] (now [[Turkmenistan]]), [[Uzbek SSR]] (now [[Uzbekistan]]), [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] (now [[Kyrgyzstan]]), and [[Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast]] (now [[Karakalpakstan]]).\n\n====Bukharan People's Soviet Republic====\n{{main|Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukhara operation (1920)}}\n[[File:Flag of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic.svg|thumb|Flag of the Bukharan PSR]]\n\nIn March 1918, activists of the [[Young Bukharian Movement]] informed the [[Bolsheviks]] that the [[Bukhara]]ns were ready for the revolution and that the people were awaiting liberation. The [[Red Army]] marched to the gates of Bukhara and demanded that the [[emir]] surrender the city to the Young Bukharans. As Russian sources report, the emir responded by murdering the Bolshevik delegation, along with several hundred Russian inhabitants of Bukhara and the surrounding territories. The majority of Bukharans did not support an invasion and the ill-equipped and ill-disciplined Bolshevik army fled back to the Soviet stronghold at Tashkent.\n\nHowever, the emir had won only a temporary respite. As the civil war in Russia wound down, Moscow sent reinforcements to Central Asia. On 2 September 1920, an army of well-disciplined and well equipped Red Army troops under the command of Bolshevik general [[Mikhail Frunze]] attacked the city. After four days of fighting, the emir's citadel (Arc) was destroyed, the [[Red flag (politics)|Red flag]] was raised from the top of [[Po-i-Kalyan|Kalyan Minaret]], and the Emir [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]] was forced to flee to his base at [[Dushanbe]] in [[Eastern Bukharan]], and finally to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].\n\nA nearby anti-Bolshevik stronghold in the Tadjik/Moslem village of Khangir (qingir) declared its independence shortly afterwards, but soon surrendered after a 14-day siege by Russian and Bokhkori Bolsheviks. It was then quickly re-integrated back into Communist Bokhorah.\n\nThe Bukharan People's Republic was proclaimed on 8 October 1920 under [[Faizullah Khojaev]]. The overthrow of the Emir was the impetus for the [[Basmachi Revolt]], an anti-Russian rebellion. In 1922, most of the territory of the republic was controlled by [[Basmachi]], surrounding the city of Bukhara. [[Joseph Stalin]] would later [[purge]] and [[exile]] many of the local [[Bukhori]] people as well as most of the local [[Jewish]] community from the former [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]].\n\nPrior to the establishment of the state of [[Israel]], the [[Bukharian Jews]] were one of the most isolated Jewish communities in the world.\n\n====Khorezm People's Soviet Republic and SSR====\n{{main|Khorezm People's Soviet Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of Khiva 1920-1923.svg|thumb|Flag of the Khorezm PSR]]\n\nThe Khorezm People's Soviet Republic was created as the successor to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] in February 1920 and officially declared on 26 April 1920. On 20 October 1923, it was transformed into the Khorezm Socialist Soviet Republic. The [[Khorezm SSR]] only survived until 17 February 1925, when it was divided between the [[Uzbek SSR]], [[Turkmen SSR]], and [[Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast]] as part of the reorganization of Central Asia by [[Moscow]] according to nationalities.\n\n====Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast====\n{{main|Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast}}\n\nThe Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast (\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430-\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0410\u041e) was created on 14 October 1924 within the [[RSFSR|Russian SFSR]] from the predominantly Kazakh and Kyrgyz parts of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On 15 May 1925 it was renamed into the Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast. On 11 February 1926 it was reorganized into the [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1926\u20131936)|Kyrgyz ASSR]]. On 5 December 1936 it became the [[Kyrgyz SSR]], one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union.\n\n====Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast====\n{{main|Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast}}\n\nThe Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast was created on February 19, 1925 by separating lands of the ethnic [[Karakalpaks]] from the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] and [[Khoresm People's Soviet Republic]].\n\nInitially located within the [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] A.O. was transferred to the [[RSFSR]] from July 20, 1930 to March 20, 1932, at which time it was elevated to the [[Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

On April 15\u201319, 1925, it was renamed Kazakh ASSR and on December 5, 1936 it became a Union Republic of the [[USSR]] called Kazakh SSR in the culminating act of the [[national delimitation]] in the Soviet Union. During the 1950s and 1960s Soviet citizens were urged to settle in the \"[[Virgin Lands]]\" of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The influx of immigrants (mostly [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], but also some forcibly resettled ethnic minorities, such as the [[Volga Germans]] and the [[Chechens]]) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-[[Kazakhs]] to outnumber natives. The influx also deprived the Kazakhs of much pasture land, making it increasingly difficult to sustain the nomadic way of life. Industry, and especially mining, developed. Russian and European culture began to influence Kazakh society.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Asia|url=http://react.usip.org/downloads/module6.pdf|website=U.S. ONLINE TRAINING FOR OSCE}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the borders of political units in Central Asia were changed along ethnic lines determined by [[Lenin]]'s [[Commissar]] for Nationalities, [[Joseph Stalin]].

Established on 14 October 1924 as the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Russian SFSR]], it was transformed into the Kyrgyz ASSR ([[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1926\u20131936)|Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]) on 1 February 1926, still being a part of the Russian SFSR. Today it is the independent state of [[Kyrgyzstan]] in Central Asia. Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kyrgyz ASSR) was the name of two different national entities within Russian SFSR, in the territories of modern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nOn 5 December 1936, it became a separate constituent republic of the USSR as the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]].\n\n[[Bishkek|Frunze]] was both the capital and the largest city of Kyrgyzstan and the Kirghiz ASSR, with a population of approximately 900,000 in 2005. In 1862, the [[Russian Empire]] destroyed the local fort and began to settle the area with Russian migrants. Over the years many fertile black soil farms were developed by the [[Tsar]]ists and, later, the process carried on by the [[USSR]]. In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1926\u20131936)|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed Frunze after the Bolshevik hero, [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was one of [[Lenin]]'s close associates, who was born in Bishkek until Kirghiz independence in 1991.\n\n====Tajikistan====\n{{main|Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Flag of Tajik SSR.svg\n | image2=Emblem of the Tajik SSR.svg\n | footer = Flag and Coat of Arms of Tajikistan\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]]''', also named '''Tajikistan''' (or by its Russian spelling, '''Tadzhikistan'''), was one of the new states created in Central Asia in 1924 was [[Uzbekistan]], which had the status of a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet socialist republic]]. In 1929 [[Tajikistan]] was detached from [[Uzbekistan]] and given full status as a Soviet socialist republic. The city of Dushanbe would become an important regional hub on the border with Afghanistan.\n\nTajikistan has 3 [[exclaves]], all of them located in the Fergana Valley region where Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan meet. The largest is [[Vorukh]] (with an area between 95 \u2013 130&nbsp;km\u00b2/37 \u2013 50 sq mi, population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located {{convert|45|km|mi}} south of [[Isfara]] on the right bank of the [[Karafshin]] river, in Kyrgyz territory. Another exclave in Kyrgyzstan is a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of [[Kairagach]]. The last is the village of [[Sarvan, Tajikistan|Sarvan]], which includes a narrow, long strip of land (about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} long by 1&nbsp;km (over \u00bd mi) wide) alongside the road from [[Angren, Uzbekistan|Angren]] to [[Kokand]]; it is surrounded by Uzbek territory. There are no foreign enclaves within Tajikistan.\n\nIn 1931, the city formerly known as \"Dyushambe\" was renamed \"Stalinabad\" (after Joseph Stalin), but in 1961, as part of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[de-Stalinization]] initiative, the city was renamed ''[[Dushanbe]]''. The [[Soviets]] transformed the area into a centre for cotton and silk production, and relocated tens of thousands of people to the city from around the Soviet Union. The population also increased with thousands of ethnic Tajiks migrating to [[Tajikistan]] following the transfer of Bukhara and Samarkand to the [[Uzbek SSR]]. [[Dushanbe]] later became the home to a university and the [[Tajik Academy of Sciences]]. Dushanbe also had a relatively high military population during the war with [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].\n\n====Turkmenistan====\n{{main|Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | width = 200\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Flag of Turkmen SSR.svg\n | image2=Emblem of the Turkmen SSR.svg\n | footer = Flag and Coat of Arms of Turkmenistan\n}}\nThe '''[[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]]''' which is also known as '''Turkmenia''' (or sometimes known as '''Turkmenistan''') was one of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|fifteen constituent republics]] of the Soviet Union. It was initially established on August 7, 1921 as [[Turkmen Oblast]] of the [[Turkestan ASSR]]. On May 13, 1925 it was transformed into Turkmen SSR and became a separate republic of the Soviet Union. Today it is the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]] in Central Asia.\n\nThe [[Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR]] was the ruling communist party of the Turkmen SSR, and a part of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. From 1985 it was led by [[Mr]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], who in 1991 renamed the party to the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]], which is no longer a communist party . The current [[Communist Party of Turkmenistan (1998)|Communist Party of Turkmenistan]] is illegal.<ref>[http://www.broadleft.org/tm.htm Leftist Parties of Turkmenistan] Leftist Parties of the World</ref>\n\n[[Ashgabat|Ashkhabad]] has a population of 695,300 (2001 census estimate) and has a primarily [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] population, with minorities of ethnic [[Russians]], [[Armenians]], and [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]]. It is 920&nbsp;km from the second largest city in [[Iran]], [[Mashhad]]. The principal industries are [[cotton]] textiles and metal working.\n\n[[Merv]] / [[Mary, Turkmenistan|Mary]] is an ancient city with a Its population was 123,000 in 1999. It has interesting Regional Museum and lies near the remains of the ancient city of Merv, which in corrupted form gives its name to the modern town. [[Carpets]] from the region of Merv are sometimes considered superior to the [[Persia]]n ones.\n\n====Uzbekistan====\n{{main|Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Flag of Uzbek SSR.svg\n | image2=Emblem of the Uzbek SSR.svg\n | footer = Flag and Coat of Arms of Uzbekistan\n}}\nThe '''[[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]''', also referred to as '''Uzbekistan''', was created in 1924 when the new national boundaries separating the Uzbek and Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republics cut off the eastern end of the Fergana Valley, as well as the slopes surrounding it. This was compounded in 1928 when the [[Tajik ASSR]] became a fully-fledged republic, the [[Tajik SSR]], and the area around [[Khujand|Khodjend]] was made a part of it. This blocked the valley's natural outlet and the routes to Samarkand and Bukhara, but none of these borders was of any great significance so long as Soviet rule lasted.\n\nThe Uzbek SSR included the Tajik ASSR until 1929, when the Tajik ASSR was upgraded to an equal status. In 1930, the Uzbek SSR capital was relocated from [[Samarkand]] to [[Tashkent]]. In 1936, the Uzbek SSR was enlarged with the addition of the [[Karakalpak ASSR]] taken from the [[Kazakh SSR]] in the last stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]]. Further bits and pieces of territory were transferred several times between the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR after World War II. During the [[Great Purge]]s of Joseph Stalin, many thousands of [[Chechens]], [[Koreans]] and [[Crimean Tatars]] were exiled to the Uzbek SSR.\n\nThe State Anthem of the Uzbek SSR was the [[national anthem]] of [[Uzbekistan]] when it was a republic of the Soviet Union and known as the [[Uzbek SSR]].\n\nThe city of [[Tashkent]] began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s, but industry increased tremendously during [[World War II]], with the relocation of factories from western Russia to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity from the hostile invading [[Nazis]]. The [[Russia]]n population increased dramatically as well, with evacuees from the war zones increasing the population to well over a million. (The Russian community would eventually comprise more than half of the total residents of Tashkent by the 1980s.) On April 26, 1966, Tashkent was destroyed by an [[1966 Tashkent earthquake|earthquake]] and over 300,000 were left homeless. At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth largest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] city and a major center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\n\nAs the nation's capital, Tashkent is still a fairly prosperous city and the capital of Uzbekistan and has a population of the city in 2006 was 2.1 million. The city has been the target of several terrorist acts since gaining [[independence]]. These have been attributed by the Uzbek the government to Islamic insurgents aided by the Afghan [[Taliban]].\n\n[[Samarkand]] is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, prospering from its location on the trade route between [[China]] and Europe ([[Silk Road]]). In 1370, Timur the Lame, or [[Tamerlane]], decided to make [[Samarkand]] the capital of his empire, which extended from [[India]] to [[Turkey]]. Despite its status as the second city of [[Uzbekistan]], the majority of the city's inhabitants are Persian-speaking [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]]. The city a became rich trading center as a major capital of the [[Silk Road]] between China and [[Western world|the West]]. The [[Timurid dynasty]]'s extensive building in Samarkand produced monuments that rank amongst some of the most striking in the Islamic world.\n\n==Nationalist rebellions==\n\n===Kokand Autonomy===\n{{main|Kokand Autonomy}}\n\n[[File:Bandera de Kokand.svg|thumb|right 200px|Flag of Kokand Autonomy, 1917\u20131918]]\n\nKokand is a city in [[Fergana Province]] in eastern [[Uzbekistan]], at the southwestern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]]. It has a population of 192,500 bu 1999. Kokand is 228&nbsp;km southeast of [[Tashkent]], 115&nbsp;km west of [[Andijan]], and 88&nbsp;km west of [[Fergana]]. It is nicknamed \u201cCity of Winds\u201d, or sometimes \u201cTown of the Boar\". It is at an altitude of 409 meters.\n\nKokand is on the crossroads of the ancient trade routes, at the junction of two main routes into the Fergana Valley, one leading northwest over the mountains to Tashkent, and the other west through [[Khujand]]. As a result, [[Kokand]] is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.\n\n[[Russia]]n imperial forces under [[Mikhail Skobelev]] captured the city in 1876 which then became part of [[Russian Turkistan]]. With the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], a [[provisional government]] attempted to maintain control in Tashkent. It was quickly overthrown and local [[Muslim]] opposition crushed. In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ([[Turkestan ASSR]]). It was the capital of the short-lived (1917\u201318) [[Russian Provisional Government|Anti-Bolshevik Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan]] (also known as [[Kokand Autonomy]]).\n\n===The Alash Autonomy===\n\n{{main|Alash Autonomy}}\n\n[[File:Flag of the Alash Autonomy.svg|thumb|200px|left|The flag of the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]'s [[Alash Autonomy]] (\u0410\u043b\u0430\u0448 \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b).

The capital city was [[Semey]] (referred to at the time as ''Alash-qala'').\n\nThe ''Alash Orda'' ({{lang-kk|\u0410\u043b\u0430\u0448 \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0430'}}, {{lang|kk-latn|Ala\u015f Orda}}) was the name of the provisional [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[government]] between 13 December 1917 and 26 August 1920. It was led by [[Akhmet Baytursinuli]], [[Alikhan Bokeikhanov]] and [[Mirjaqip Dulatuli]] amongst others.\n\nThe [[Alash (party)|Alash Party]] proclaimed the autonomy of the Kazakh people in December 1917. Membership consists from 25 members (10 positions reserved for non-Kazakhs) and 15 member candidates. They formed special educational commission and established militia regimentsas their armed forces.\n\n[[File:XXth Century Citizen's Atlas map of Central Asia.png|thumb|right|200px|The borders of the [[Russia]]n imperial territories of [[Kiva]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Kokand]] in the time period of 1902\u20131903.]]\n\n=== Basmachi revolt ===\n{{main|Basmachi Revolt}}\n\nIn 1897, the railway reached [[Tashkent]], and finally in 1906 a direct rail link with European Russia was opened across the [[steppe]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]]. This led to much larger numbers of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlers flowing into [[Turkestan]] than had hitherto been the case, and their settlement was overseen by a specially created [[Emigration|Migration]] Department in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435). This caused considerable discontent amongst the local population, [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Kazakhs]] and [[Sart]]s, as these settlers took scarce land and water resources away from them. In 1916 discontent boiled over in the [[Basmachi Revolt]], sparked by a decree conscripting the natives into [[Labour battalion]]s (they had previously been exempt from military service). Thousands of settlers were killed, and this was matched by Russian reprisals, particularly against the [[nomadic]] population. The competition for land and water which ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of [[Tsarist]] Russia, with the most serious uprising, the [[Central Asian Revolt]], occurring in 1916. The Kazakhs attacked Russian and [[Cossack]] villages, killing indiscriminately. The Russians' [[revenge]] was merciless. A [[military]] force drove 300,000 Kazakhs to flee into the mountains or to [[China]]. When [[Approximation|approximately]] 80,000 of them returned the next year, many of them were slaughtered by Tsarist forces. Order had not really been restored by the time the [[February Revolution]] took place in 1917. This would usher in a still bloodier chapter in Turkestan's history, as the [[Bolsheviks]] of the [[Tashkent Soviet]] (made up entirely of Russian soldiers and railway workers, with no Muslim members) launched an attack on the autonomous [[Jadid]] government in [[Kokand]] early in 1918, which left 14,000 dead. Resistance to the [[Bolsheviks]] by the local population (dismissed as '[[Basmachi Revolt|Basmachi]]' or '[[Banditry]]' by [[Soviet historians]]) continued well into the 1920s.\n\n===Kengir Uprising===\n{{main|Kengir uprising}}\n\nDuring the rule of Joseph Stalin, a prison labour camp of the Steplag division of the [[Gulag]] was set up adjacent to the village of [[Kengir]], near the River Kengir in central Kazakhstan. It was mentioned in [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]''. The location of the camp was near the city of Dzhezkazgan. Russian actor [[Oleg Yankovsky]] is the most famous of the city's natives.  There was a prison revolt in 1954, by [[political prisoner]]s, [[criminals]], and other inmates.\n\n===Exiles===\n{{see also|Minorities in Turkey#Uzbeks|Uzbeks in Pakistan}}\nDissident Islamist and anti-Soviet Central Asians fled to Afghanistan, British India, and to the Hijaz in Saudi Arabia.<ref>http://carnegieendowment.org/files/cp_77_olcott_roots_final.pdf http://carnegieendowment.org/files/olcottroots.pdf page 8</ref><ref>https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/research/reportcentralasiaislamicextremism.pdf page 7</ref> The last Emir of Bukhara [[Mohammed Alim Khan]] fled to Afghanistan.

That attracted a lot of mountaineers into the area.]]\n\n===Oil and gas===\nAfter [[World War II]] the Soviet Union rapidly industrialized Kazakhstan and started prospecting for oil in the whole of Soviet Central Asia. Oil was found in Uzbekistan and both [[oil]] and [[gas]] were found in Turkmenistan. These fuel supplies would prove invaluable to the region over the coming years.\n\nThe central part of the [[geological depression]] that forms the Ferghana Valley is characterized by [[block subsidence]], originally to depths estimated at 6\u20137&nbsp;km, largely filled with [[sediments]] that range in age as far back as the [[Permian-Triassic boundary]]. Some of the sediments are [[marine carbonates]] and [[clays]]. The faults are upthrusts and [[overthrust]]s. [[Anticline]]s associated with these [[fault (geology)|faults]] form traps for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], which has been discovered in 52 small fields.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027103235/http://geocities.com/internetgeology/L34.html Petroleum Potential of Fergana Intermontane Depression] Internet Geology Newsletter\n</ref>\n\nKazakhstan's [[Mangystau Province]] has an area of 165,600 square kilometers and a population of 316,847. It is a major [[oil]]- and gas-producing region. The city of [[Aktau]] was built in Kazakhstan's [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]] as a small village to house the region's oil workers in 1961. Over the years a large [[wikt:influx|influx]] of Russian and Ukrainian oil and [[chemical]] workers arrived. Engineers discovered large amounts of [[crude oil]] and [[petroleum]] in the area in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], and when drilling commenced, much of the area was built up around the industry. Aktau is Kazakhstan's only seaport on the Caspian Sea.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1991 Aktau, which had become a city, bore the name \"Shevchenko\" in honour of the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814\u20131861), who had been assigned to the area on military{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} work. The average temperature on January is \u22123&nbsp;\u00b0C, on July +26&nbsp;\u00b0C. Annual rainfall averages 150&nbsp;mm. Aktau had a population of 154,500 {{as of | 2004 | lc = on}}.\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{main| Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia}}\nMuch of the [[road and railway infrastructure]] that exists across Central Asia was developed when the areas was in the Soviet Union. As a result, it often disregards existing national borders. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this infrastructure has faced decline and degradation.<ref name=\"International Crisis Group\">{{cite web|title=Central Asia: Decay and Decline|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/201-central-asia-decay-and-decline.aspx|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=17 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405043556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/201-central-asia-decay-and-decline.aspx|archive-date=5 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Metallurgy ===\n[[File:Kazakhstan-Dzhezkazgan.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan]]\n\nKazakhstan had started to produce and refine sizable amounts of [[tin]] and [[uranium]] by the early 1970s. [[Vanadium]] and [[cobalt]] were, and still are also mined in the south of the country. Uranium was also first produced in Uzbekistan in the 1970s.\n\nThe city of [[Zhezkazgan]] was created in 1938 in connection with the exploitation of the rich local [[copper]] deposits. In 1973 a large mining and metallurgical complex was constructed to the southeast to smelt the copper that until then had been sent elsewhere for processing. Other metal ores mined and processed locally are [[manganese]], [[iron]] and [[gold]]. It is on a reservoir of the [[Kara-Kengir River]] and has a population of 90,000 (1999 census).\n\nIts [[urban area]] includes the neighbouring mining town of [[Satpaev|Satpayev]], total population 148,700. 55% of the population are [[Kazakhs]], 30% [[Russians]], with smaller minorities of [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Chechens]] and [[Koreans]]. Dzhezkazgan has an extreme [[continental climate]]. The average temperature ranges from +24&nbsp;\u00b0C (75&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July to \u221216&nbsp;\u00b0C (3&nbsp;\u00b0F) in January.\n\nToday the city is the headquarters of the copper conglomerate [[Kazakhmys]], the city's main employer. The company has subsidiaries in [[China]], [[Russia]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].\n\n=== Cement ===\nCement was a major product in both the cities of [[Shymkent]] and [[Dushanbe]] in the south of the region.\n\n=== Hydro-electricity ===\nBy the early 1970s, the Soviets had started to build some of their [[hydroelectric]] power stations in Eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tadjikistan as part of an overall development strategy. The waters of the [[Ili River]] and of Lake Balkhash are considered to be of a vital economic importance to [[Kazakhstan]]. The Ili river is dammed for hydroelectric power at [[Kaptchagayskoye]], and the river waters are heavily diverted for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[irrigation]] and for [[industry|industrial]] purposes.\n\n=== Cotton ===\nThe Soviets began to grow cotton in Uzbekistan after the ''[[Virgin Lands]]'' project and the mass use of the isolated and now shrinking [[Aral Sea]] for desert irrigation in the early 1950s. A massive expansion of irrigation canals during the Soviet period, to irrigate [[cotton]] fields, wrought ecological carnage to the area, with the river drying up long before reaching the Aral Sea which, as a result, has shrunk to a small remnant of its former size.\n\n=== Baikonur Cosmodrome ===\nThe [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] was founded in Kazakhstan on June 2, 1955, during the [[Cold War]], as one of many long-range [[nuclear missile]] bases in the region, but diverged into space travel.\n\nOn June 8, 2005 the [[Russian Federation Council]] ratified an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan extending Russia's rent term of the spaceport until 2050.\n\n==Culture, religion and ethnicity==\n[[File:Central Asia Ethnic.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ethnic and linguistic patchwork of Soviet Central Asia]]\n\nFollowing a series of migrations, mostly predating Soviet rule, that displaced the autochthonous [[Iranian peoples]], most of the inhabitants of Soviet Central Asia were speakers of either [[Kipchak languages]] (such as Kazakhs), [[Uyghuric languages]] (Uzbeks) or [[Oghuz languages]] (Turkmens). Those populations were nomadic and settled, respectively. There remained traces of some settled [[farming]] and urban Iranian communities like the [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and Bukhara in the south, and [[nomadic]] [[Mongol]]ic Kyrgiz on the border with [[China]].\n\nIn Kazakh [q\u0251z\u0251qt\u0251r]; Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438; the English name 'Kazakh' is transliterated from Russian) are [[Turkic people]] of the northern parts of Central Asia (largely [[Kazakhstan]], but also found in parts of [[Uzbekistan]], China, [[Russia]], and [[Mongolia]]).\n\nAccording to Robert G. Gordon, Jr., editor of the Ethnologue: Languages of the World, classifies [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]]-[[Oirat language|Oirat]] under the Oirat-Khalkha group, since he contends that Kalmyk-Oirat is related to Khalkha Mongolian \u2013 the national language of Mongolia. The descent of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] from the [[autochthonous Siberian population]] is confirmed on the other hand by recent genetic studies.\n\nThe Slavic community was would grow very rapidly under communism and Russians would eventually become a major ethnic group in the region. The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population followed Orthodox [[Christianity]], while the rest were mostly [[Sunni]] Muslims. Various nationality, such as the Meskhetian [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Volga Germans]] would get banished to the region. Over the years ethnic groups changed. [[Uralsk]] and [[Oral, Kazakhstan|Oral]] are now Russians (54%) and Kazakhs (34%), while it's also Kazakh 43.6% and Russian 40.2% in [[Almaty]].\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Bolsheviks would quickly set about closing mosques and churches throughout the USSR. This became particularly prevalent in the 1930s, but had been fully abandoned by the 1980s.\n\n===Veil===\n{{main|Paranja}}\n\nIn Uzbekistan and Tajikistan women wore veils which covered their entire face and body like the [[Paranja]] and faranji.\n\nThe traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists.<ref name=\"AbdullaevAkbarzaheh2010\">{{cite book|author1=Kamoludin Abdullaev|author2=Shahram Akbarzaheh|title=Historical Dictionary of Tajikistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mC9RsIYy8m8C&pg=PA381|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6061-2|page=381}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pannier  |first=Bruce |date=April 1, 2015 |title= Central Asia's Controversial Fashion Statements  |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/central-asia-fashion-islamic-risque-western-national-mentality/26932437.html |newspaper=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty}}</ref>\n\n===Y-haplogroups===\nAccording to the interim results of Kazach mitochondrial DNA studies<ref>https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9184531</ref> (where sample consisted of only 246 individuals), the main maternal lineages of Kazakhs are: [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]] (17,9 %), [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]] (16%), [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G]] (16%), [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]] (3,25 %), [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F]] (2,44 %), which is of eastern-Eurasian origin (58%), and haplogroups [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]] (13%), [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U5]] (3,25 %), [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]] (0,41 %), [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] (0,81 %), [[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)|W]] (1,63 %), of western Eurasian origin (41%).\n\nThe on a similar level, the  distribution of Y-DNA haplogroups, according to E.K.

Remarkably, 63% of modern Kyrgyz men share [[Haplogroup R1a1 (Y-DNA)]] with [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]] (64%), [[Ruthenians]] (54%), [[Poles]] and [[Hungarians]] (~60%), and even [[Icelanders]] (25%).

Central Asian SSRs declared independence in 1991. In terms of area, it is nearly synonymous with [[Russian Turkestan]], the name for the region during the [[Russian Empire]]. Soviet Central Asia went through many territorial divisions before the current borders were created in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n\n===Former divisions===\n\n====Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic====\n{{main|Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:SovietCentralAsia1922.svg|right|250px|thumb|Map of Soviet Central Asia in 1922 with the Turkestan ASSR and the Kyrgyz ASSR]]\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Russian [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory that later would constitute Soviet Central Asia. [[Russia]] annexed [[Lake Issyk Kul]] in north east [[Kyrgyzstan]] of off [[China]] in the early 1860s, lands of [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], [[Khanate of Khiva]], [[Emirate of Bukhara]] in the second half of [[19th century|1800s]].\n\nEmerging from the Russian Empire following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, the USSR was a union of several Soviet republics, but the synecdoche Russia \u2014 after its largest and dominant constituent state \u2014 continued to be commonly used throughout the state's existence. ''Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic'' (initially Turkestan Socialist Federative Republic) (April 30, 1918 \u2013 October 27, 1924) was created from the [[Turkestan Krai]] of [[Imperial Russia]]. Its capital was [[Tashkent]], population about 5,000,000.\n\nBritish and Persian forces briefly tried to reach [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]] and the Turkmen port of [[Krasnovodsk]]. [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], [[Samarkand]], [[Kokand]], [[Dushanbe]] and the former [[Trans-Caspian province]] would see various anti-Bolshevik risings over the next few years.\n\nIn 1924, it was split into [[Tajik ASSR]] (now [[Tajikistan]]), [[Turkmen SSR]] (now [[Turkmenistan]]), [[Uzbek SSR]] (now [[Uzbekistan]]), [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] (now [[Kyrgyzstan]]), and [[Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast]] (now [[Karakalpakstan]]).\n\n====Bukharan People's Soviet Republic====\n{{main|Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukhara operation (1920)}}\n[[File:Flag of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic.svg|thumb|Flag of the Bukharan PSR]]\n\nIn March 1918, activists of the [[Young Bukharian Movement]] informed the [[Bolsheviks]] that the [[Bukhara]]ns were ready for the revolution and that the people were awaiting liberation. The [[Red Army]] marched to the gates of Bukhara and demanded that the [[emir]] surrender the city to the Young Bukharans. As Russian sources report, the emir responded by murdering the Bolshevik delegation, along with several hundred Russian inhabitants of Bukhara and the surrounding territories. The majority of Bukharans did not support an invasion and the ill-equipped and ill-disciplined Bolshevik army fled back to the Soviet stronghold at Tashkent.\n\nHowever, the emir had won only a temporary respite. As the civil war in Russia wound down, Moscow sent reinforcements to Central Asia. On 2 September 1920, an army of well-disciplined and well equipped Red Army troops under the command of Bolshevik general [[Mikhail Frunze]] attacked the city. After four days of fighting, the emir's citadel (Arc) was destroyed, the [[Red flag (politics)|Red flag]] was raised from the top of [[Po-i-Kalyan|Kalyan Minaret]], and the Emir [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]] was forced to flee to his base at [[Dushanbe]] in [[Eastern Bukharan]], and finally to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].\n\nA nearby anti-Bolshevik stronghold in the Tadjik/Moslem village of Khangir (qingir) declared its independence shortly afterwards, but soon surrendered after a 14-day siege by Russian and Bokhkori Bolsheviks. It was then quickly re-integrated back into Communist Bokhorah.\n\nThe Bukharan People's Republic was proclaimed on 8 October 1920 under [[Faizullah Khojaev]]. The overthrow of the Emir was the impetus for the [[Basmachi Revolt]], an anti-Russian rebellion. In 1922, most of the territory of the republic was controlled by [[Basmachi]], surrounding the city of Bukhara.

On 20 October 1923, it was transformed into the Khorezm Socialist Soviet Republic. The [[Khorezm SSR]] only survived until 17 February 1925, when it was divided between the [[Uzbek SSR]], [[Turkmen SSR]], and [[Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast]] as part of the reorganization of Central Asia by [[Moscow]] according to nationalities.\n\n====Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast====\n{{main|Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast}}\n\nThe Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast (\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430-\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0410\u041e) was created on 14 October 1924 within the [[RSFSR|Russian SFSR]] from the predominantly Kazakh and Kyrgyz parts of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

On April 15\u201319, 1925, it was renamed Kazakh ASSR and on December 5, 1936 it became a Union Republic of the [[USSR]] called Kazakh SSR in the culminating act of the [[national delimitation]] in the Soviet Union. During the 1950s and 1960s Soviet citizens were urged to settle in the \"[[Virgin Lands]]\" of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The influx of immigrants (mostly [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], but also some forcibly resettled ethnic minorities, such as the [[Volga Germans]] and the [[Chechens]]) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-[[Kazakhs]] to outnumber natives. The influx also deprived the Kazakhs of much pasture land, making it increasingly difficult to sustain the nomadic way of life. Industry, and especially mining, developed. Russian and European culture began to influence Kazakh society.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Asia|url=http://react.usip.org/downloads/module6.pdf|website=U.S. ONLINE TRAINING FOR OSCE}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the borders of political units in Central Asia were changed along ethnic lines determined by [[Lenin]]'s [[Commissar]] for Nationalities, [[Joseph Stalin]].

Today it is the independent state of [[Kyrgyzstan]] in Central Asia. Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kyrgyz ASSR) was the name of two different national entities within Russian SFSR, in the territories of modern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nOn 5 December 1936, it became a separate constituent republic of the USSR as the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]].\n\n[[Bishkek|Frunze]] was both the capital and the largest city of Kyrgyzstan and the Kirghiz ASSR, with a population of approximately 900,000 in 2005. In 1862, the [[Russian Empire]] destroyed the local fort and began to settle the area with Russian migrants. Over the years many fertile black soil farms were developed by the [[Tsar]]ists and, later, the process carried on by the [[USSR]]. In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1926\u20131936)|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed Frunze after the Bolshevik hero, [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was one of [[Lenin]]'s close associates, who was born in Bishkek until Kirghiz independence in 1991.\n\n====Tajikistan====\n{{main|Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Flag of Tajik SSR.svg\n | image2=Emblem of the Tajik SSR.svg\n | footer = Flag and Coat of Arms of Tajikistan\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]]''', also named '''Tajikistan''' (or by its Russian spelling, '''Tadzhikistan'''), was one of the new states created in Central Asia in 1924 was [[Uzbekistan]], which had the status of a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet socialist republic]]. In 1929 [[Tajikistan]] was detached from [[Uzbekistan]] and given full status as a Soviet socialist republic. The city of Dushanbe would become an important regional hub on the border with Afghanistan.\n\nTajikistan has 3 [[exclaves]], all of them located in the Fergana Valley region where Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan meet. The largest is [[Vorukh]] (with an area between 95 \u2013 130&nbsp;km\u00b2/37 \u2013 50 sq mi, population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located {{convert|45|km|mi}} south of [[Isfara]] on the right bank of the [[Karafshin]] river, in Kyrgyz territory.

There are no foreign enclaves within Tajikistan.\n\nIn 1931, the city formerly known as \"Dyushambe\" was renamed \"Stalinabad\" (after Joseph Stalin), but in 1961, as part of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[de-Stalinization]] initiative, the city was renamed ''[[Dushanbe]]''. The [[Soviets]] transformed the area into a centre for cotton and silk production, and relocated tens of thousands of people to the city from around the Soviet Union. The population also increased with thousands of ethnic Tajiks migrating to [[Tajikistan]] following the transfer of Bukhara and Samarkand to the [[Uzbek SSR]]. [[Dushanbe]] later became the home to a university and the [[Tajik Academy of Sciences]]. Dushanbe also had a relatively high military population during the war with [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].\n\n====Turkmenistan====\n{{main|Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | width = 200\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Flag of Turkmen SSR.svg\n | image2=Emblem of the Turkmen SSR.svg\n | footer = Flag and Coat of Arms of Turkmenistan\n}}\nThe '''[[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]]''' which is also known as '''Turkmenia''' (or sometimes known as '''Turkmenistan''') was one of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|fifteen constituent republics]] of the Soviet Union. It was initially established on August 7, 1921 as [[Turkmen Oblast]] of the [[Turkestan ASSR]]. On May 13, 1925 it was transformed into Turkmen SSR and became a separate republic of the Soviet Union. Today it is the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]] in Central Asia.\n\nThe [[Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR]] was the ruling communist party of the Turkmen SSR, and a part of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. From 1985 it was led by [[Mr]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], who in 1991 renamed the party to the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]], which is no longer a communist party .

This was compounded in 1928 when the [[Tajik ASSR]] became a fully-fledged republic, the [[Tajik SSR]], and the area around [[Khujand|Khodjend]] was made a part of it. This blocked the valley's natural outlet and the routes to Samarkand and Bukhara, but none of these borders was of any great significance so long as Soviet rule lasted.\n\nThe Uzbek SSR included the Tajik ASSR until 1929, when the Tajik ASSR was upgraded to an equal status. In 1930, the Uzbek SSR capital was relocated from [[Samarkand]] to [[Tashkent]]. In 1936, the Uzbek SSR was enlarged with the addition of the [[Karakalpak ASSR]] taken from the [[Kazakh SSR]] in the last stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]]. Further bits and pieces of territory were transferred several times between the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR after World War II. During the [[Great Purge]]s of Joseph Stalin, many thousands of [[Chechens]], [[Koreans]] and [[Crimean Tatars]] were exiled to the Uzbek SSR.\n\nThe State Anthem of the Uzbek SSR was the [[national anthem]] of [[Uzbekistan]] when it was a republic of the Soviet Union and known as the [[Uzbek SSR]].\n\nThe city of [[Tashkent]] began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s, but industry increased tremendously during [[World War II]], with the relocation of factories from western Russia to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity from the hostile invading [[Nazis]]. The [[Russia]]n population increased dramatically as well, with evacuees from the war zones increasing the population to well over a million. (The Russian community would eventually comprise more than half of the total residents of Tashkent by the 1980s.) On April 26, 1966, Tashkent was destroyed by an [[1966 Tashkent earthquake|earthquake]] and over 300,000 were left homeless. At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth largest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] city and a major center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\n\nAs the nation's capital, Tashkent is still a fairly prosperous city and the capital of Uzbekistan and has a population of the city in 2006 was 2.1 million. The city has been the target of several terrorist acts since gaining [[independence]]. These have been attributed by the Uzbek the government to Islamic insurgents aided by the Afghan [[Taliban]].\n\n[[Samarkand]] is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, prospering from its location on the trade route between [[China]] and Europe ([[Silk Road]]). In 1370, Timur the Lame, or [[Tamerlane]], decided to make [[Samarkand]] the capital of his empire, which extended from [[India]] to [[Turkey]]. Despite its status as the second city of [[Uzbekistan]], the majority of the city's inhabitants are Persian-speaking [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]]. The city a became rich trading center as a major capital of the [[Silk Road]] between China and [[Western world|the West]]. The [[Timurid dynasty]]'s extensive building in Samarkand produced monuments that rank amongst some of the most striking in the Islamic world.\n\n==Nationalist rebellions==\n\n===Kokand Autonomy===\n{{main|Kokand Autonomy}}\n\n[[File:Bandera de Kokand.svg|thumb|right 200px|Flag of Kokand Autonomy, 1917\u20131918]]\n\nKokand is a city in [[Fergana Province]] in eastern [[Uzbekistan]], at the southwestern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]]. It has a population of 192,500 bu 1999. Kokand is 228&nbsp;km southeast of [[Tashkent]], 115&nbsp;km west of [[Andijan]], and 88&nbsp;km west of [[Fergana]]. It is nicknamed \u201cCity of Winds\u201d, or sometimes \u201cTown of the Boar\". It is at an altitude of 409 meters.\n\nKokand is on the crossroads of the ancient trade routes, at the junction of two main routes into the Fergana Valley, one leading northwest over the mountains to Tashkent, and the other west through [[Khujand]]. As a result, [[Kokand]] is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.\n\n[[Russia]]n imperial forces under [[Mikhail Skobelev]] captured the city in 1876 which then became part of [[Russian Turkistan]]. With the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], a [[provisional government]] attempted to maintain control in Tashkent. It was quickly overthrown and local [[Muslim]] opposition crushed. In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ([[Turkestan ASSR]]). It was the capital of the short-lived (1917\u201318) [[Russian Provisional Government|Anti-Bolshevik Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan]] (also known as [[Kokand Autonomy]]).\n\n===The Alash Autonomy===\n\n{{main|Alash Autonomy}}\n\n[[File:Flag of the Alash Autonomy.svg|thumb|200px|left|The flag of the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]'s [[Alash Autonomy]] (\u0410\u043b\u0430\u0448 \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b).

It was led by [[Akhmet Baytursinuli]], [[Alikhan Bokeikhanov]] and [[Mirjaqip Dulatuli]] amongst others.\n\nThe [[Alash (party)|Alash Party]] proclaimed the autonomy of the Kazakh people in December 1917. Membership consists from 25 members (10 positions reserved for non-Kazakhs) and 15 member candidates. They formed special educational commission and established militia regimentsas their armed forces.\n\n[[File:XXth Century Citizen's Atlas map of Central Asia.png|thumb|right|200px|The borders of the [[Russia]]n imperial territories of [[Kiva]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Kokand]] in the time period of 1902\u20131903.]]\n\n=== Basmachi revolt ===\n{{main|Basmachi Revolt}}\n\nIn 1897, the railway reached [[Tashkent]], and finally in 1906 a direct rail link with European Russia was opened across the [[steppe]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]]. This led to much larger numbers of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlers flowing into [[Turkestan]] than had hitherto been the case, and their settlement was overseen by a specially created [[Emigration|Migration]] Department in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435). This caused considerable discontent amongst the local population, [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Kazakhs]] and [[Sart]]s, as these settlers took scarce land and water resources away from them. In 1916 discontent boiled over in the [[Basmachi Revolt]], sparked by a decree conscripting the natives into [[Labour battalion]]s (they had previously been exempt from military service). Thousands of settlers were killed, and this was matched by Russian reprisals, particularly against the [[nomadic]] population. The competition for land and water which ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of [[Tsarist]] Russia, with the most serious uprising, the [[Central Asian Revolt]], occurring in 1916. The Kazakhs attacked Russian and [[Cossack]] villages, killing indiscriminately. The Russians' [[revenge]] was merciless. A [[military]] force drove 300,000 Kazakhs to flee into the mountains or to [[China]]. When [[Approximation|approximately]] 80,000 of them returned the next year, many of them were slaughtered by Tsarist forces. Order had not really been restored by the time the [[February Revolution]] took place in 1917. This would usher in a still bloodier chapter in Turkestan's history, as the [[Bolsheviks]] of the [[Tashkent Soviet]] (made up entirely of Russian soldiers and railway workers, with no Muslim members) launched an attack on the autonomous [[Jadid]] government in [[Kokand]] early in 1918, which left 14,000 dead. Resistance to the [[Bolsheviks]] by the local population (dismissed as '[[Basmachi Revolt|Basmachi]]' or '[[Banditry]]' by [[Soviet historians]]) continued well into the 1920s.\n\n===Kengir Uprising===\n{{main|Kengir uprising}}\n\nDuring the rule of Joseph Stalin, a prison labour camp of the Steplag division of the [[Gulag]] was set up adjacent to the village of [[Kengir]], near the River Kengir in central Kazakhstan. It was mentioned in [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]''. The location of the camp was near the city of Dzhezkazgan.

That attracted a lot of mountaineers into the area.]]\n\n===Oil and gas===\nAfter [[World War II]] the Soviet Union rapidly industrialized Kazakhstan and started prospecting for oil in the whole of Soviet Central Asia. Oil was found in Uzbekistan and both [[oil]] and [[gas]] were found in Turkmenistan. These fuel supplies would prove invaluable to the region over the coming years.\n\nThe central part of the [[geological depression]] that forms the Ferghana Valley is characterized by [[block subsidence]], originally to depths estimated at 6\u20137&nbsp;km, largely filled with [[sediments]] that range in age as far back as the [[Permian-Triassic boundary]]. Some of the sediments are [[marine carbonates]] and [[clays]]. The faults are upthrusts and [[overthrust]]s. [[Anticline]]s associated with these [[fault (geology)|faults]] form traps for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], which has been discovered in 52 small fields.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027103235/http://geocities.com/internetgeology/L34.html Petroleum Potential of Fergana Intermontane Depression] Internet Geology Newsletter\n</ref>\n\nKazakhstan's [[Mangystau Province]] has an area of 165,600 square kilometers and a population of 316,847. It is a major [[oil]]- and gas-producing region. The city of [[Aktau]] was built in Kazakhstan's [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]] as a small village to house the region's oil workers in 1961. Over the years a large [[wikt:influx|influx]] of Russian and Ukrainian oil and [[chemical]] workers arrived. Engineers discovered large amounts of [[crude oil]] and [[petroleum]] in the area in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], and when drilling commenced, much of the area was built up around the industry. Aktau is Kazakhstan's only seaport on the Caspian Sea.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1991 Aktau, which had become a city, bore the name \"Shevchenko\" in honour of the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814\u20131861), who had been assigned to the area on military{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} work. The average temperature on January is \u22123&nbsp;\u00b0C, on July +26&nbsp;\u00b0C. Annual rainfall averages 150&nbsp;mm. Aktau had a population of 154,500 {{as of | 2004 | lc = on}}.\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{main| Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia}}\nMuch of the [[road and railway infrastructure]] that exists across Central Asia was developed when the areas was in the Soviet Union. As a result, it often disregards existing national borders. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this infrastructure has faced decline and degradation.<ref name=\"International Crisis Group\">{{cite web|title=Central Asia: Decay and Decline|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/201-central-asia-decay-and-decline.aspx|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=17 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405043556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/201-central-asia-decay-and-decline.aspx|archive-date=5 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Metallurgy ===\n[[File:Kazakhstan-Dzhezkazgan.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan]]\n\nKazakhstan had started to produce and refine sizable amounts of [[tin]] and [[uranium]] by the early 1970s. [[Vanadium]] and [[cobalt]] were, and still are also mined in the south of the country. Uranium was also first produced in Uzbekistan in the 1970s.\n\nThe city of [[Zhezkazgan]] was created in 1938 in connection with the exploitation of the rich local [[copper]] deposits. In 1973 a large mining and metallurgical complex was constructed to the southeast to smelt the copper that until then had been sent elsewhere for processing. Other metal ores mined and processed locally are [[manganese]], [[iron]] and [[gold]]. It is on a reservoir of the [[Kara-Kengir River]] and has a population of 90,000 (1999 census).\n\nIts [[urban area]] includes the neighbouring mining town of [[Satpaev|Satpayev]], total population 148,700. 55% of the population are [[Kazakhs]], 30% [[Russians]], with smaller minorities of [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Chechens]] and [[Koreans]]. Dzhezkazgan has an extreme [[continental climate]]. The average temperature ranges from +24&nbsp;\u00b0C (75&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July to \u221216&nbsp;\u00b0C (3&nbsp;\u00b0F) in January.\n\nToday the city is the headquarters of the copper conglomerate [[Kazakhmys]], the city's main employer. The company has subsidiaries in [[China]], [[Russia]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].\n\n=== Cement ===\nCement was a major product in both the cities of [[Shymkent]] and [[Dushanbe]] in the south of the region.\n\n=== Hydro-electricity ===\nBy the early 1970s, the Soviets had started to build some of their [[hydroelectric]] power stations in Eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tadjikistan as part of an overall development strategy. The waters of the [[Ili River]] and of Lake Balkhash are considered to be of a vital economic importance to [[Kazakhstan]]. The Ili river is dammed for hydroelectric power at [[Kaptchagayskoye]], and the river waters are heavily diverted for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[irrigation]] and for [[industry|industrial]] purposes.\n\n=== Cotton ===\nThe Soviets began to grow cotton in Uzbekistan after the ''[[Virgin Lands]]'' project and the mass use of the isolated and now shrinking [[Aral Sea]] for desert irrigation in the early 1950s. A massive expansion of irrigation canals during the Soviet period, to irrigate [[cotton]] fields, wrought ecological carnage to the area, with the river drying up long before reaching the Aral Sea which, as a result, has shrunk to a small remnant of its former size.\n\n=== Baikonur Cosmodrome ===\nThe [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] was founded in Kazakhstan on June 2, 1955, during the [[Cold War]], as one of many long-range [[nuclear missile]] bases in the region, but diverged into space travel.\n\nOn June 8, 2005 the [[Russian Federation Council]] ratified an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan extending Russia's rent term of the spaceport until 2050.\n\n==Culture, religion and ethnicity==\n[[File:Central Asia Ethnic.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ethnic and linguistic patchwork of Soviet Central Asia]]\n\nFollowing a series of migrations, mostly predating Soviet rule, that displaced the autochthonous [[Iranian peoples]], most of the inhabitants of Soviet Central Asia were speakers of either [[Kipchak languages]] (such as Kazakhs), [[Uyghuric languages]] (Uzbeks) or [[Oghuz languages]] (Turkmens). Those populations were nomadic and settled, respectively. There remained traces of some settled [[farming]] and urban Iranian communities like the [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and Bukhara in the south, and [[nomadic]] [[Mongol]]ic Kyrgiz on the border with [[China]].\n\nIn Kazakh [q\u0251z\u0251qt\u0251r]; Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438; the English name 'Kazakh' is transliterated from Russian) are [[Turkic people]] of the northern parts of Central Asia (largely [[Kazakhstan]], but also found in parts of [[Uzbekistan]], China, [[Russia]], and [[Mongolia]]).\n\nAccording to Robert G. Gordon, Jr., editor of the Ethnologue: Languages of the World, classifies [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]]-[[Oirat language|Oirat]] under the Oirat-Khalkha group, since he contends that Kalmyk-Oirat is related to Khalkha Mongolian \u2013 the national language of Mongolia. The descent of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] from the [[autochthonous Siberian population]] is confirmed on the other hand by recent genetic studies.\n\nThe Slavic community was would grow very rapidly under communism and Russians would eventually become a major ethnic group in the region. The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population followed Orthodox [[Christianity]], while the rest were mostly [[Sunni]] Muslims. Various nationality, such as the Meskhetian [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Volga Germans]] would get banished to the region. Over the years ethnic groups changed. [[Uralsk]] and [[Oral, Kazakhstan|Oral]] are now Russians (54%) and Kazakhs (34%), while it's also Kazakh 43.6% and Russian 40.2% in [[Almaty]].\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Bolsheviks would quickly set about closing mosques and churches throughout the USSR. This became particularly prevalent in the 1930s, but had been fully abandoned by the 1980s.\n\n===Veil===\n{{main|Paranja}}\n\nIn Uzbekistan and Tajikistan women wore veils which covered their entire face and body like the [[Paranja]] and faranji.\n\nThe traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists.<ref name=\"AbdullaevAkbarzaheh2010\">{{cite book|author1=Kamoludin Abdullaev|author2=Shahram Akbarzaheh|title=Historical Dictionary of Tajikistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mC9RsIYy8m8C&pg=PA381|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6061-2|page=381}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pannier  |first=Bruce |date=April 1, 2015 |title= Central Asia's Controversial Fashion Statements  |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/central-asia-fashion-islamic-risque-western-national-mentality/26932437.html |newspaper=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty}}</ref>\n\n===Y-haplogroups===\nAccording to the interim results of Kazach mitochondrial DNA studies<ref>https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9184531</ref> (where sample consisted of only 246 individuals), the main maternal lineages of Kazakhs are: [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]] (17,9 %), [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]] (16%), [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G]] (16%), [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]] (3,25 %), [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F]] (2,44 %), which is of eastern-Eurasian origin (58%), and haplogroups [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]] (13%), [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]] (4,07 %), [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U5]] (3,25 %), [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]] (0,41 %), [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] (0,81 %), [[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)|W]] (1,63 %), of western Eurasian origin (41%).\n\nThe on a similar level, the  distribution of Y-DNA haplogroups, according to E.K.
