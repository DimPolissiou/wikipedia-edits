Quinlan's work has been published in many books and magazines, as well as on various online poetry databases.  His writing is based on his real life experiences as a [[rancher]], and really gives his poetry a lifelike feel.\n\n==Early life and education==\nVess Quinlan was born in Eagle, Colorado on November 23, 1940, and is part of the fourth generation on both sides of his family to spend most of their lives working at raising livestock in rural Colorado.\n \nHis initial interest in poetry was sparked during a year-long bout with [[polio]] as a boy in 1951. During his time confined to bed, he began reading and writing poetry of the Cowboy variety. It seems only natural that his style of choice was western, due to the fact that he had worked as a ranch chore boy and cattle hand since the age of 15, when he ran away from home. \nFrom the time Quinlan started high school, it is believed that he attended at least 9 different high schools while doing chores morning and night for ranch families.  He then worked mostly as a ranch hand until he found a partner able to purchase a farm and ranch near San Acacio, Colorado.\n\nHe still lives on the place, and has since 1970, but is no longer involved in the operation.\n\n==Beginnings in poetry==\nAs mentioned above, Vess Quinlan's initial interest in poetry was sparked while being contained indoors with polio for nearly an entire year in 1951. During this time of confinement, he began reading poetry with themes related to ranching and farming, and started to write some of his own. As time progressed, he began writing more and more poetry, and as word spread about the quality and nature of his work, his reputation was built into what it is today.\n\n==Example of works==\n\n===Sold Out===\nThe worst will come tomorrow\n\nWhen we load the saddle horses.\n\nWe are past turning back;\n\nThe horses must be sold.\n\nThe old man turns away, hurting,\n\nAs the last cow is loaded.\n\nI hunt words to ease his pain\n\nBut there is nothing to say.\n\nHe walks away to lean\n\nOn a top rail of the corral\n\nAnd look across the calving pasture\n\nToward the willow grown creek.\n\nI follow.\n\nAbsently mimicking his walk,\n\nAnd stand a post away.\n\nWe don\u2019t speak of causes or reasons.\n\nDon\u2019t speak at all;\n\nWe just stand there\n\nLeaning on the weathered poles,\n\nWhile the shadows consume the pasture.\n\nSold Out is one of Quinlan's more well known poems. This is just one example of his ability to give an outsider such a vivid picture of what life is really like for a cowboy, or rancher.\n\n==Cowboy poetry conventions==\nUntil very recently, [[Cowboy poetry]] was an aspect of the Western Lifestyle that simply was not prevalent. This all changed in January 1985, when the first Cowboy Poets gathering was held in [[Elko, Nevada]]. It was at this time, that the genre really took off, and became more widely recognized and appreciated. Quinlan attended the first Elko Gathering and has often been invited to perform at gatherings that developed in other states including the [[National Cowboy Poetry Gathering]].

It is located in W\u0101d\u012b Farda(h).

However, the Minean kingdom was recaptured by the Saba kingdom in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe city was the capitol of the Minaean kingdom until they shifted their capital to [[Qarnawu|Qarn\u0101wu]] at some time. However, and Yathill remained a sort of religious center for them.\n\nUnder the Minean kingdom it was an important stop on the incense route.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref> The ancient city of Yathill was surrounded by a wall 14 meters high, much of which is still visible today; this wall had 57 towers and two gates.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref> Inscriptions mention that the wall was rebuilt by the [[Sabaeans]] in 450 BCE. \nThe city was retaken by the Saba in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe city was taken by the Romans under [[Augustus]].<ref>Hermann von Wissmann: Zur Arch\u00e4ologie und Antiken Geographie von S\u00fcdarabien, (siehe Lit.), p10.</ref> They left quickly, however, due to disease and poor water.

There is a [[necropolis]] near this temple, which contains numerous grave stelae.  The temple is very typical of the Minaean style and consists of 16 columns and beams.

It is located in W\u0101d\u012b Farda(h). It was known to the Greeks and Romans as Athlula (or Athrula), from the ancient [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] ''Y\u1e6fl'' (probably vocalized ''Yathill'').<ref>Cass. Dio 53.29.8; Strabo 820.</ref>\n\nBar\u0101qish was inhabited from time immemorial; one generation building their houses on the ruins of the earlier ones. In the main area of the site, there still remain, the ruins of a dome, a mosque, a well and tower, as well as many pottery shards and pieces of glass. People lived in the town up to the 1960s but it has since been abandoned, and is at present being occupied by the military.\n\nBaraqish, known as Yathil at the time,<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref> was located in the wide [[Wadi Fardha]]. The [[wadi]] was a popular caravan route because of the presence of water and it allowed caravans to pass though Yathill.\n\n==History and Archaeology==\n===History===\nIts origins are very archaic, possibly 1000 BCE, but it reached its peak of importance in about 400 BCE when it became the capital of the [[Minaean]] Kingdom.\n\n[[Paleolithic]] [[ceramic]] finds indicate the area was inhabited from at least the 10th century BC.\n\nThe city itself was dominated by [[Sabaeans|Saba]] in the 6th century BC.<ref>Charles Aithie, Patricia Aithie: Yemen: jewel of Arabia. Stacey International, 2001, p152.</ref> and is mentioned in a document of [[Yitha'amar Bayyin II]], mentioning a rebellion in the city.<ref>Walter W.

However, the Minean kingdom was recaptured by the Saba kingdom in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe city was the capitol of the Minaean kingdom until they shifted their capital to [[Qarnawu|Qarn\u0101wu]] at some time. However, and Yathill remained a sort of religious center for them.\n\nUnder the Minean kingdom it was an important stop on the incense route.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref> The ancient city of Yathill was surrounded by a wall 14 meters high, much of which is still visible today; this wall had 57 towers and two gates.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref> Inscriptions mention that the wall was rebuilt by the [[Sabaeans]] in 450 BCE. \nThe city was retaken by the Saba in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe city was taken by the Romans under [[Augustus]].<ref>Hermann von Wissmann: Zur Arch\u00e4ologie und Antiken Geographie von S\u00fcdarabien, (siehe Lit.), p10.</ref> They left quickly, however, due to disease and poor water. The [[Roman army]] passed through under the command of [[Aelius Gallus]], according to [[Strabo]]<ref>Strabo: ''Geographica'' (xvi . 4 . 22).</ref> and [[Cassius Dio]]<ref>Cass.

There is a [[necropolis]] near this temple, which contains numerous grave stelae.  The temple is very typical of the Minaean style and consists of 16 columns and beams. There are also a number of ancient inscriptions in the South Arabian alphabet through the city.\n\nThere is another temple in the center of the city but only four of its columns are still erect.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-deplores-destruction-parts-ancient-city-baraqish-calls-protection-yemen  UNESCO Director-General deplores destruction of parts of ancient city of Baraqish, calls for protection of Yemen\u2019s heritage].</ref><ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248820824_Statuettes_from_the_excavations_of_the_temple_of_Nakrah_Temple_A_at_Barqish_Republic_of_Yemen  in\u2002Arabian archaeology and epigraphy 10(1):58-68 \u00b7 May 1999].</ref><ref>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Breton, [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Plan-of-Nakrah-temple-in-Baraqish-Robin-1998_fig4_312928371 Plan of Nakrah temple in Bar\u00e2qish] (Robin, 1998).</ref><ref>Alessandro de Maigret, THE EXCAVATIONS OF THE TEMPLE OF NAKRAH AT BAR\u0100QISH (YEMEN) ''Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies''  Vol. 21, Proceedings of the Twenty Fourth SEMINAR FOR ARABIAN STUDIES held at Oxford on 24th - 26th July 1990 (1991), pp. 159-172</ref>\n<ref>[https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2018/3/26/yemen-suffers-cultural-vandalism-during-its-war  Yemen suffers cultural].</ref>\n\nThe city is mentioned in a number of [[Ma'inic language]] [[temple]] stelea across southern [[Arabia]].<ref>Greg Fisher, Arabs and Empires Before Islam ([[Oxford University Press]], 2015 ) p 100-101.</ref>\n\nA team of [[Italy|Italian]] [[archaeologist]]s recently discovered a temple with its roof intact.
