It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of 's-Hertogenbosch}}\n\nThe city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''des Hertogen bosch''\u2014\"the Duke's forest\". The duke in question was [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry I]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. \n\n[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]\nIn the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]], The town suffered a catastrophic fire in 1463, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch probably witnessed; presumably, this fire provided inspiration for the fiery hell-scapes that would later make Bosch famous.\n\nUntil 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n===Eighty Years' War===\nThe wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended by [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]].\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical population\n|align       = left\n|cols        = \n|pop_name    = \n|percentages = pagr\n|footnote    = \n|source      = {{Harvnb|Lourens|Lucassen|1997|pp=45\u201346}}\n|1374|14526\n|1438|12973\n|1464|10507\n|1473|10579\n|1480|13185\n|1496|15552\n|1526|18571\n|1560|17500\n|1600|18000\n|1665|9000\n|1747|12574\n|1795|12841\n}}\n\nIn the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender\u2014an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).\n\n===Louis XIV to Bonaparte===\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1794, French revolutionary troops under command of [[Charles Pichegru]] took the city with hardly a fight: in the [[Batavian Republic]], both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights.\n\nFrom 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.\n\n===Kingdom of the Netherlands===\nThe next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.\n\n===World War II and after===\n[[File:Voorgevel - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Interlanguage link multi|De Moriaan|nl}}]]\nOne of the few official [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] complexes in [[Western Europe]] outside Germany and [[Austria]] was named after 's-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as [[Herzogenbusch]] (see [[List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch]]). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000&nbsp;were [[Jew]]s. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as 'Kamp [[Vught]]', because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nIt was conquered by the Germans in [[World War II]] in 1940 and occupied by them for over four years. The allies struck back - the railway station was bombed by planes of the [[Royal Air Force]] on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24\u201327&nbsp;October 1944&nbsp;during [[Operation Pheasant]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]] of [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Robert Knox Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Knox Ross]]'s [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] after [[major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Donald Bremner (British Army officer)|Donald Bremner]] of the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]], of [[158th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|158th Infantry Brigade]], had already routed the enemy on 23-24 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rory Bremner salutes his East Lancashire war hero dad |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404172449/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |archivedate=2015-04-04 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was probably only geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung over to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:sHertogenbosch-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of 's-Hertogenbosch, as of March 2014]]\n\n=== Population centres ===\nThe population centres in the municipality are: [[Bokhoven]], [[Crevecoeur('s-Hertogenbosch)|Crevecoeur]], [[Deuteren]] (former village), [[Dieskant]], [[Empel]], [[Engelen ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Engelen]], [[Gewande]], 's-Hertogenbosch, [[Hintham]], [[Kruisstraat ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Kruisstraat]], [[Maliskamp]], [[Meerwijk]], [[Orthen]] (former village), [[Oud-Empel]], and [[Rosmalen]].\n\n===Climate===\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

This program was initially started in 1991 and continues to this day.\n\nThe city has its own food speciality, the [[Bossche Bol]]\u2014effectively a giant [[profiterole]], somewhat larger than a tennis ball, which is filled with whipped cream and coated with chocolate.\n\nThe spoken language is [[Maasland]]s (The variant spoken in 's-Hertogenbosch is called ''Bosch'' which is placed among the Central North [[Brabantian]] dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as [[East Brabantian]]), which is very similar to colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oost-Brabants|last=Swanenberg|first=Jos|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Cor|publisher=Sdu Uitgevers|year=2002|isbn=9789012090100|series=Taal in stad en land, 7.|location=Den Haag|pages=|language=Dutch|oclc=783055844|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[De Toonzaal]] is a [[music venue]] for [[chamber music]], [[improvised music]], and [[experimental music]]. For popular music there is the venue [[W2 Concertzaal|W2]] (or Willem II).\n\n===Carnival celebrations===\n[[File:PeervaandenMuggenheuvel.jpg|thumb|right|Mayor Ton Rombouts, the Mayor of Oeteldonk, and the prince at City Hall in 2007]]\n's-Hertogenbosch has a strong carnival tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881-1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of \"Oeteldonk\", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. \"Donk\" is a reference to a dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It's also a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of [[Shrove Tuesday]] that often led to excesses. \n\nOeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a girl. The village is headed by the Mayor of Oeteldonk \"Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd\". Each year the mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval \"Prince Amadeiro XXV\" at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.\n\nThe citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called ''boerenkiel'' is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The ''boerenkiel'' is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red - white - and - yellow) are very similar.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Sint-Jans-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]]]]\n's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like [[Rotterdam]], 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.\n\n=== The city center ===\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Rijksmonument 21719 Stadhuis, Markt 1.JPG|left|thumb|City Hall of 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Marktplein - Den Bosch Markt.jpg|thumb|Market square]]\nThe city center has a cozy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual [[grid plan]], where streets meet at right angles.  The center is dominated by [[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]] (''Sint Jans kathedraal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its [[Brabantine Gothic]] design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and [[acid rain]].\n\nOn the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/moriaan/ Teletijd.nl: 'De Moriaan' before and after renovation]</ref> which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/DeLakenmarktTeu2019sHertogenboschCirca1530 Painting: De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch]</ref> The town hall is an originally 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it got a new facade in the style of the [[Dutch Baroque architecture]]. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would. \n\nHidden below the old city is a [[canal]] network called the [[Binnendieze]], which once spanned {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.  \n\n=== The fortifications === \n[[File:Stadsmuurdenboschnl.jpg|thumb|left|City rampart]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch - Citadellaan - Vestingwerken.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:Citadel van 's-Hertogenbosch|Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch]]]]\n[[File:Boze Griet.JPG|thumb|''Boze Griet'', a forged cannon from 1510 in the ''Bastionder'']]\n's-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth to seventeenth century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city's strong defensive position' laying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused that the main ramparts were preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory. \n\nApart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late medieval (fifteenth century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal [[Bastion fort|bastions]] were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The citadel in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.\n\nIn the north east of the old city, the hexagonal powder arsenal, or ''Kruithuis'',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/kruithuis/ Teletijd.nl: Kruithuis inner court]</ref> still exists, one of only two of its kind in the country. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum [[Bastion Oranje ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Bastionder]]. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.\n\n=== Museums === \nThe town's museums are the [[Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch]], the [[Noordbrabants Museum]], the [[Jheronimus Bosch Art Center]] and the [[Museum Slager]]. The painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (c. 1450\u20131516) remains probably the best known citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n=== Nature === \n[[File:Sint-Janskathedraal, Het Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|View on the St. Jan from Bossche Broek]]\nOn the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old [[polder]] that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store access water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas.\n\nThe Bossche Broek is now a 202 ha [[nature reserve]], that stretches all the way to [[Vught]]. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a [[Natura 2000]] area. Rare species in the area are the [[Scarce large blue]] and the [[Misgurnus fossilis| European weather loach]], but what is really unique about the area is its proximity to a city center.   \n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThe city is also the location of the ''Bolwoningen'' complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.aol.com/blog/gallery/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/#photo-3 |title=The Worlds Ugliest Buildings \u2013 AOL Real Estate |publisher=Realestate.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nThe city has one professional football club, [[FC Den Bosch]] It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium [[De Vliert]], which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]). \n\n's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club [[HC 's-Hertogenbosch|HC Den Bosch]]. The women's team in particular kind of dominates the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club [[EiffelTowers Den Bosch|New Heroes Den Bosch]] is also very successful. The city's rugby team is called [http://www.dukesrugby.nl The Dukes]. It became the national rugby champion in 2008. \n\nAs regards events the city is host to the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]], a combined [[ATP Tour]] and [[WTA Tour]] grass court tennis event played two weeks before the [[Wimbledon Championships]]. The [[World Archery Championships]] and [[World Para Archery Championship]] were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of \u2019s-Hertogenbosch.\n\n==Transport==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:\u00b4s-Hertogenbosch, station \u00b4s-Hertogenbosch foto6 2016-01-23 09.53.jpg|thumb|right|[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]]]]\nThe [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|CEMT]] class II. Therefore the M\u00e1ximakanaal of 8 km was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy [[A2_motorway_(Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the most important north-south connection of the Netherlands. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1989 it finally became a [[controlled-access highway]]. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Eindhoven]] became a controlled-access highway. The situation in [[Maastricht]] was only solved in 2016, when the [[Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel]] was opened. On the east-west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the [[A59 motorway (Netherlands)]]. The [[A65 motorway (Netherlands)|A65 motorway]] between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Tilburg]] is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.\n\n[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]] is on the [[Utrecht\u2013Boxtel railway| Utrecht\u2013Boxtel part]] of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north-south trains depart every ten minutes. On the [[Tilburg\u2013Nijmegen railway]] trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for [[Arriva]] buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are [['s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station]] and [[Rosmalen railway station]]. [[Vught railway station]] is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Netherlands.27 top cycling city|Fietsstad 2011]]'' \u2014 the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action: ''In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is '''lower''' than in the rest of the Netherlands''(cyclist union).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/314111-den-bosch-fietsstad-van-2011.html |title= Den Bosch fietsstad van 2011 |trans-title = 's-Hertogenbosch bicycle city 2011 | lang=nl |date= 2011-11-17 |publisher= NOS }}</ref> :Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond.\n\n==Education==\n's-Hertogenbosch has multiple [[vocational university|Vocational universities]] called 'Hogeschool' in Dutch. The [[HAS University of Applied Sciences|HAS Hogeschool]] of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology. [[Avans University of Applied_Sciences | Avans Hogeschool]] is located in 's-Hertogenbosch and two nearby cities.

It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of 's-Hertogenbosch}}\n\nThe city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''des Hertogen bosch''\u2014\"the Duke's forest\". The duke in question was [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry I]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. \n\n[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]\nIn the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]], The town suffered a catastrophic fire in 1463, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch probably witnessed; presumably, this fire provided inspiration for the fiery hell-scapes that would later make Bosch famous.\n\nUntil 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n===Eighty Years' War===\nThe wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended by [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]].\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical population\n|align       = left\n|cols        = \n|pop_name    = \n|percentages = pagr\n|footnote    = \n|source      = {{Harvnb|Lourens|Lucassen|1997|pp=45\u201346}}\n|1374|14526\n|1438|12973\n|1464|10507\n|1473|10579\n|1480|13185\n|1496|15552\n|1526|18571\n|1560|17500\n|1600|18000\n|1665|9000\n|1747|12574\n|1795|12841\n}}\n\nIn the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender\u2014an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).\n\n===Louis XIV to Bonaparte===\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1794, French revolutionary troops under command of [[Charles Pichegru]] took the city with hardly a fight: in the [[Batavian Republic]], both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights.\n\nFrom 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.\n\n===Kingdom of the Netherlands===\nThe next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.\n\n===World War II and after===\n[[File:Voorgevel - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Interlanguage link multi|De Moriaan|nl}}]]\nOne of the few official [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] complexes in [[Western Europe]] outside Germany and [[Austria]] was named after 's-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as [[Herzogenbusch]] (see [[List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch]]). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000&nbsp;were [[Jew]]s. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as 'Kamp [[Vught]]', because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nIt was conquered by the Germans in [[World War II]] in 1940 and occupied by them for over four years. The allies struck back - the railway station was bombed by planes of the [[Royal Air Force]] on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24\u201327&nbsp;October 1944&nbsp;during [[Operation Pheasant]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]] of [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Robert Knox Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Knox Ross]]'s [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] after [[major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Donald Bremner (British Army officer)|Donald Bremner]] of the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]], of [[158th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|158th Infantry Brigade]], had already routed the enemy on 23-24 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rory Bremner salutes his East Lancashire war hero dad |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404172449/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |archivedate=2015-04-04 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was probably only geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung over to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:sHertogenbosch-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of 's-Hertogenbosch, as of March 2014]]\n\n=== Population centres ===\nThe population centres in the municipality are: [[Bokhoven]], [[Crevecoeur('s-Hertogenbosch)|Crevecoeur]], [[Deuteren]] (former village), [[Dieskant]], [[Empel]], [[Engelen ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Engelen]], [[Gewande]], 's-Hertogenbosch, [[Hintham]], [[Kruisstraat ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Kruisstraat]], [[Maliskamp]], [[Meerwijk]], [[Orthen]] (former village), [[Oud-Empel]], and [[Rosmalen]].\n\n===Climate===\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

It is currently the fourth city of [[Noord Brabant]]. It is home to many national and international businesses such as [[Heineken]], [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[Tyco International]], [[SAP SE|SAP]] and many others.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Overzicht - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110195 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Typical street in 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n's-Hertogenbosch is home to a variety of events such as the theatre festival ''Boulevard'', ''[[Jazz in Duketown]]'', and hip hop in duketown, the start of the [[Tour de France]] (1996), [[Tour Feminin]] (1997), the [['s-Hertogenbosch International Vocal Competition|International Vocal Competition]], [[November Music]] (a contemporary music festival) and the UNICEF Open (formerly the [[Ordina Open]]) grass court tennis tournament (in the nearby town of [[Rosmalen]]). There are also over 350 restaurants, pubs and caf\u00e9s to be found in the city.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is also home to the European Ceramic Work Centre. This is a juried international ceramic residency where they invite artists, designers and architects from around to the world to explore the medium of Ceramics. This program was initially started in 1991 and continues to this day.\n\nThe city has its own food speciality, the [[Bossche Bol]]\u2014effectively a giant [[profiterole]], somewhat larger than a tennis ball, which is filled with whipped cream and coated with chocolate.\n\nThe spoken language is [[Maasland]]s (The variant spoken in 's-Hertogenbosch is called ''Bosch'' which is placed among the Central North [[Brabantian]] dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as [[East Brabantian]]), which is very similar to colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oost-Brabants|last=Swanenberg|first=Jos|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Cor|publisher=Sdu Uitgevers|year=2002|isbn=9789012090100|series=Taal in stad en land, 7.|location=Den Haag|pages=|language=Dutch|oclc=783055844|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[De Toonzaal]] is a [[music venue]] for [[chamber music]], [[improvised music]], and [[experimental music]].

In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881-1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of \"Oeteldonk\", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. \"Donk\" is a reference to a dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It's also a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of [[Shrove Tuesday]] that often led to excesses. \n\nOeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a girl. The village is headed by the Mayor of Oeteldonk \"Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd\". Each year the mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval \"Prince Amadeiro XXV\" at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.\n\nThe citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called ''boerenkiel'' is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The ''boerenkiel'' is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red - white - and - yellow) are very similar.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Sint-Jans-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]]]]\n's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like [[Rotterdam]], 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.\n\n=== The city center ===\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Rijksmonument 21719 Stadhuis, Markt 1.JPG|left|thumb|City Hall of 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Marktplein - Den Bosch Markt.jpg|thumb|Market square]]\nThe city center has a cozy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual [[grid plan]], where streets meet at right angles.  The center is dominated by [[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]] (''Sint Jans kathedraal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its [[Brabantine Gothic]] design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and [[acid rain]].\n\nOn the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/moriaan/ Teletijd.nl: 'De Moriaan' before and after renovation]</ref> which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/DeLakenmarktTeu2019sHertogenboschCirca1530 Painting: De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch]</ref> The town hall is an originally 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it got a new facade in the style of the [[Dutch Baroque architecture]]. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would. \n\nHidden below the old city is a [[canal]] network called the [[Binnendieze]], which once spanned {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.  \n\n=== The fortifications === \n[[File:Stadsmuurdenboschnl.jpg|thumb|left|City rampart]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch - Citadellaan - Vestingwerken.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:Citadel van 's-Hertogenbosch|Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch]]]]\n[[File:Boze Griet.JPG|thumb|''Boze Griet'', a forged cannon from 1510 in the ''Bastionder'']]\n's-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth to seventeenth century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city's strong defensive position' laying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused that the main ramparts were preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory. \n\nApart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late medieval (fifteenth century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal [[Bastion fort|bastions]] were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The citadel in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.\n\nIn the north east of the old city, the hexagonal powder arsenal, or ''Kruithuis'',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/kruithuis/ Teletijd.nl: Kruithuis inner court]</ref> still exists, one of only two of its kind in the country. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum [[Bastion Oranje ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Bastionder]]. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.\n\n=== Museums === \nMuseums are the [[Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch]], [[Noordbrabants Museum]], [[Jheronimus Bosch Art Center]] and [[Museum Slager]]. The painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (c. 1450\u20131516) remains probably the best known citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n=== Nature === \n[[File:Sint-Janskathedraal, Het Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|View on the St. Jan from Bossche Broek]]\nOn the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old [[polder]] that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store access water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas.\n\nThe Bossche Broek is now a 202 ha [[nature reserve]], that stretches all the way to [[Vught]]. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a [[Natura 2000]] area. Rare species in the area are the [[Scarce large blue]] and the [[Misgurnus fossilis| European weather loach]], but what is really unique about the area is its proximity to a city center.   \n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThe city is also the location of the ''Bolwoningen'' complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.aol.com/blog/gallery/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/#photo-3 |title=The Worlds Ugliest Buildings \u2013 AOL Real Estate |publisher=Realestate.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nThe city has one professional football club, [[FC Den Bosch]] It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium [[De Vliert]], which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]). \n\n's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club [[HC 's-Hertogenbosch|HC Den Bosch]]. The women's team in particular kind of dominates the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club [[EiffelTowers Den Bosch|New Heroes Den Bosch]] is also very successful. The city's rugby team is called [http://www.dukesrugby.nl The Dukes]. It became the national rugby champion in 2008. \n\nAs regards events the city is host to the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]], a combined [[ATP Tour]] and [[WTA Tour]] grass court tennis event played two weeks before the [[Wimbledon Championships]]. The [[World Archery Championships]] and [[World Para Archery Championship]] were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of \u2019s-Hertogenbosch.\n\n==Transport==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:\u00b4s-Hertogenbosch, station \u00b4s-Hertogenbosch foto6 2016-01-23 09.53.jpg|thumb|right|[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]]]]\nThe [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|CEMT]] class II. Therefore the M\u00e1ximakanaal of 8 km was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy [[A2_motorway_(Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the most important north-south connection of the Netherlands. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1989 it finally became a [[controlled-access highway]]. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Eindhoven]] became a controlled-access highway. The situation in [[Maastricht]] was only solved in 2016, when the [[Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel]] was opened. On the east-west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the [[A59 motorway (Netherlands)]]. The [[A65 motorway (Netherlands)|A65 motorway]] between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Tilburg]] is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.\n\n[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]] is on the [[Utrecht\u2013Boxtel railway| Utrecht\u2013Boxtel part]] of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north-south trains depart every ten minutes. On the [[Tilburg\u2013Nijmegen railway]] trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for [[Arriva]] buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are [['s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station]] and [[Rosmalen railway station]]. [[Vught railway station]] is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Netherlands.27 top cycling city|Fietsstad 2011]]'' \u2014 the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action: ''In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is '''lower''' than in the rest of the Netherlands''(cyclist union).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/314111-den-bosch-fietsstad-van-2011.html |title= Den Bosch fietsstad van 2011 |trans-title = 's-Hertogenbosch bicycle city 2011 | lang=nl |date= 2011-11-17 |publisher= NOS }}</ref> :Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond.\n\n==Education==\n's-Hertogenbosch has multiple [[vocational university|Vocational universities]] called 'Hogeschool' in Dutch. The [[HAS University of Applied Sciences|HAS Hogeschool]] of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology. [[Avans University of Applied_Sciences | Avans Hogeschool]] is located in 's-Hertogenbosch and two nearby cities. The [[AKV St. Joost]] is an art academy that is now part of Avans and dates back to 1812.<ref>[http://www.akvstjoost.nl/en AKV|St.Joost] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055337/http://www.akvstjoost.nl/en |date=2013-09-21 }}.

Ghamand Chand was a brave and strong ruler who restored the prestige of Kangra. As he was unable to capture [[Kangra fort]], he built another fort at Tira Sujanpur on the left bank of the Beas, almost opposite to Alampur on a hill overlooking the town. He died in 1774 and was succeeded by his son, Tegh Chand, who died too soon in 1775.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180701145502/http://himachalpradeshtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/History-of-Kangra.pdf</ref> Kangra was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh's Sikh Empire in 1810. Kangra became a district of [[British India]] in 1846, when it was ceded to British India at the conclusion of the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].

She heard the voice of Tem\u00fcjin and, recognizing it, she got off the cart and came running towards him. Although it was still night, Lady B\u00f6rte and Qo\u2019aq\u010din both recognized Tem\u00fcjin\u2019s reins and tether and grabbed them.

After they arrived three days later than expected, Tem\u00fcjin suspected that Naya'a was motivated by his [[carnal]] feelings towards Khulan to help her and her father. While Tem\u00fcjin was interrogating Naya'a, Khulan spoke up in his defense and invited Tem\u00fcjin to have sex with her and inspect her virginity personally, which pleased him.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=88|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the end Tem\u00fcjin accepted Dayir Usan's surrender and Khulan as his new wife. However, Dayir Usan later retracted his surrender but he and his subjects were eventually subdued, his possessions plundered, and he himself killed. Tem\u00fcjin continued to carry out military campaigns against the Merkits until their final dispersal in 1218. Khulan was able to achieve meaningful status as one of Tem\u00fcjin's wives and managed one of the large wifely camps, in which other wives, concubines, children and animals lived.

However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict.

Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken.

These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present. Kublai Khan had already met Haiyun in 1242 and been swayed towards Buddhism.<ref>Page 14-19, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>\n\nGenghis Khan's decree exempting Daoists (''xiansheng''), Buddhists (''toyin''), Christians (''erke'\u00fcd'') and Muslims (''dashmad'') from tax duties were continued by his successors until the end of the Yuan dynasty in 1368.

According to Juvaini, Genghis Khan allowed religious freedom to Muslims during his conquest of Khwarezmia \"permitting the recitation of the ''takbir'' and the ''azan''\". However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror. He was initially pleased with Wahid-ud-Din but then dismissed him from his service saying \"I used to consider you a wise and prudent man, but from this speech of yours, it has become evident to me that you do not possess complete understanding and that your comprehension is but small\".<ref>Page 246&ndash;248, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book\n| last       = Morgan\n| first       = David\n| author-link = David Morgan (historian)\n| title       = The Mongols.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops.

Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each.

The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

([[Lake Baikal]] and ocean were called ''tenggis'' by the Mongols. However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis ''tenggis'' they could have said, and written, \"Tenggis Khan\", which they did not.) Zh\u00e8ng (Chinese: \u6b63) meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier ''-s'', creating \"Jenggis\", which in medieval romanization would be written \"Genghis\".

The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.\n\nNo evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present. Kublai Khan had already met Haiyun in 1242 and been swayed towards Buddhism.<ref>Page 14-19, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>\n\nGenghis Khan's decree exempting Daoists (''xiansheng''), Buddhists (''toyin''), Christians (''erke'\u00fcd'') and Muslims (''dashmad'') from tax duties were continued by his successors until the end of the Yuan dynasty in 1368.

According to Juvaini, Genghis Khan allowed religious freedom to Muslims during his conquest of Khwarezmia \"permitting the recitation of the ''takbir'' and the ''azan''\". However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants.

Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops. It was taken through Communist-held territory in [[Yan'an]] some {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|[[Mongol Empire]]]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

This third and final version of the Frankenstone family more closely resembled the version previously seen in ''The New Fred and Barney Show'' than the Frankenstones that just moved in next door in the prime-time specials.

Rockjaw was also featured in the ''Bedrock Cops'' segment with Fred and Barney as part-time police officers (assisted by the [[Shmoo]]) who fought crime in the city of Bedrock, however, the trio spent most of their time chasing after Rockjaw.\n\nThe previously soft-natured Frank is now hot-tempered and wired with his voice provided by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] in his traditional high-pitched, hyper-whiny style. Frank became volatile at the drop of a hat, especially when he dealt with his annoying neighbor and rival [[Fred Flintstone]]. Frank and Fred were both frustrated by the friendships between their wives (Hidea and [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma]]) and children (Freaky and [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]), and they always seemed to be thrust into one mess after another because of each other.\n\n''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' ran for two seasons and consecutively with two more Flintstone prime-time specials in 1981 (which both revert to [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]'s version of Frank with his wife Oblivia, and children Hidea and Stubby). The continuity of the prime-time Flintstones and Saturday morning Flintstones drift farther apart because both have their own version of Frankenstone neighbors.\n\nAfter ''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' ended in 1982, it is never explained what happened to the Frankenstones or their castle and nor are they referred to in any subsequent spin-off series, specials or animated movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webrockonline.com/faq/Flintstones_FAQ_26.php|title=Webrock - The Flintstones FAQ|publisher=Webrockonline.com|accessdate=2018-03-15}}</ref>\n\n''The Frankenstones'' segment was later rerun as part of the package show ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984).\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n* Frank Frankenstone makes a cameo appearance as an enemy character at the haunted dungeon stage in the 1991 video game ''[[The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino & Hoppy]]''.\n* Frank Frankenstone appears in two different comic books: ''The Flintstone Kids #10'' (published in 1989 by [[Star Comics]]) and ''The Flintstones #1'' (published in 1995 by [[Archie Comics]]).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstone_Comedy_Show__1980_/The_Frankenstones/index.html ''The Frankenstones'' Episode Guide] at [[The Big Cartoon DataBase]]\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-frankenstone/4005-137775/issues-cover/ ''The Flintstones'' comic book series]\n\n{{The Flintstones}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frankenstones}}\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:The Flintstones characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Works based on Frankenstein]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox fictional family\n| name             = The Frankenstones\n| image            = The Frankenstones.png\n| caption          = \n| series           = [[The Flintstones]]\n| creator          = [[Hanna-Barbera]]\n| first_minor      = Fred & Barney Meet the Frankenstones\n| first_major      = [[The New Fred and Barney Show]]\n| last_minor       = House Wars\n| last_major       = [[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]\n}}\n\n'''The Frankenstones''' are a family of [[character (arts)|fictional characters]] who appeared on ''[[The Flintstones]]'' [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[animated series|television series]] and [[television special]]s through the early 1980s.

Frank and Fred were both frustrated by the friendships between their wives (Hidea and [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma]]) and children (Freaky and [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]), and they always seemed to be thrust into one mess after another because of each other.\n\n''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' ran for two seasons and consecutively with two more Flintstone prime-time specials in 1981 (which both revert to [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]'s version of Frank with his wife Oblivia, and children Hidea and Stubby). The continuity of the prime-time Flintstones and Saturday morning Flintstones drift farther apart because both have their own version of Frankenstone neighbors.\n\nAfter ''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' ended in 1982, it is never explained what happened to the Frankenstones or their castle and nor are they referred to in any subsequent spin-off series, specials or animated movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webrockonline.com/faq/Flintstones_FAQ_26.php|title=Webrock - The Flintstones FAQ|publisher=Webrockonline.com|accessdate=2018-03-15}}</ref>\n\n''The Frankenstones'' segment was later rerun as part of the package show ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984).\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n* Frank Frankenstone makes a cameo appearance as an enemy character at the haunted dungeon stage in the 1991 video game ''[[The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino & Hoppy]]''.\n* Frank Frankenstone appears in two different comic books: ''The Flintstone Kids #10'' (published in 1989 by [[Star Comics]]) and ''The Flintstones #1'' (published in 1995 by [[Archie Comics]]).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstone_Comedy_Show__1980_/The_Frankenstones/index.html ''The Frankenstones'' Episode Guide] at [[The Big Cartoon DataBase]]\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-frankenstone/4005-137775/issues-cover/ ''The Flintstones'' comic book series]\n\n{{The Flintstones}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frankenstones}}\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:The Flintstones characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Works based on Frankenstein]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Flintstone Primetime Specials", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frankenstones"}
