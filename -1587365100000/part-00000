As a native of Lviv, even after the war she felt a bond with the city of her childhood and youth, which she would reveal later in her work. She studied [[Classics|classical philology]] and graduated in [[romance studies]] at the  [[University of Lviv]]. Knowledge of Greek and Latin, German, and especially fluent knowledge of French, which she mastered with confidence, along with a lively and absorbent intellectual sensitivity, allowed her to read in the original the works of the classics, and also to closely follow modern [[Western culture]].\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn 1924, Anna Chrzanowska's married her professor, Jerzy Kowalski, classical philologist at the University of Lviv, who was 10 years older than her. In the interwar period, they traveled a lot around Europe: they visited, among others, [[Italy]], [[Paris]], [[Lausanne]] (where Kowalska attended lectures in Latin literature), [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (where she also listened to university lectures). In 1946, their daughter Maria, called Tula at home, was born in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. Kowalska joined the literary life of interwar Lviv, cooperated with the Sygna\u0142y weekly and the Przedmie\u015bcie literary group. In 1936, she co-organized the Congress of Culture Workers.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the Kowalski family remained in Soviet Lviv: Jerzy continued lecturing at the university, Anna was a witness of political repressions (her brother was imprisoned, and her sister-in-law was [[Great Purge|deported to Siberia]] by [[Russians]]). In 1943, they moved to Warsaw where Kowalska joined the underground resistance. She was in the city during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].\n\nIn 1945, Anna moved with her husband to [[Wroc\u0142aw]] where Jerzy Kowalski organized classical philology at the [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]. They settled in [[Kar\u0142owice]], in a villa at Samuel Bogumi\u0142 Linde Street 10. After the death of her husband (he died of cancer in 1948) Kowalska remained in Wroc\u0142aw. \n\n=== After World War II ===\nAnna participated in the literary and intellectual life of Wroc\u0142aw, and from 1947 to 1952, she was a co-editor of the quarterly \"Zeszyty Wroc\u0142awskie\". A room in the house at Linde Street was rented by [[Czes\u0142aw Hernas]], then a student of Polish studies and a close friend of Kowalska and [[Maria D\u0105browska]].\n\nIn 1954, Anna Kowalska moved to Warsaw and lived together with her daughter and Maria D\u0105browska (in a spacious apartment in a pre-war tenement house at Aleja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci). In 1963, they went together to Italy, [[Switzerland]] and Paris - visiting, among others [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Jerzy Stempowski]]. She participated in the literary life of the capital, belonging to ZLP and [[Pen Club]]. She was one of the signatories of the so-called [[Letter of 34]] to Prime Minister [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]] regarding freedom of culture. Despite having a progressing cancer, she followed the events of [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968]], bitterly journaling anti-democratic activities of the authorities.\n\n=== Death ===\nShe died after long (journaled) struggles against cancer. She was buried at the [[Pow\u0105zki Cemetery]] (Aleja Zas\u0142u\u017conych, grave 143)<ref>{{cite web|title=Anna Kowalska|url=https://cmentarze.um.warszawa.pl/pomnik.aspx?pom_id=3776|agency=cmentarze.um.warszawa.pl|accessdate=2019-12-06}}</ref>.\n\n== Personality ==\nKowalska was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]<ref>[[Krzysztof Tomasik]]: ''Czy wielki pisarz mo\u017ce by\u0107 lesbijk\u0105?

Soon friendship and passionate love formed between women. Anna Kowalska remained a lifelong friend and companion of D\u0105browska's life. The bond lasted also during Kowalska's stay in Wroc\u0142aw and regardless of her motherhood. Living together in Warsaw, however, Kowalska felt (which she reports in the diary) the tear between her daughter Tulcia and D\u0105browska, who disliked each other. During the last years of her life, D\u0105browska lived in her own home in Komor\u00f3w near Warsaw. After D\u0105browska's death in 1965, Kowalska felt humiliated by her friend's will (in which she was omitted), before a later version was found, which included her and made her responsible for the legacy of writing.<ref>[[Tadeusz Drewnowski]]: ''Wyprowadzka z czy\u015b\u0107ca.
