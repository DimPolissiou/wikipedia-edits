It is assigned to the [[United States Seventh Fleet]].\n\n==Command history==\n\n===1920-1922===\nDestroyer Squadron 7 (DesRon 7) was first established in September 1920 as a reserve squadron of 15 destroyers homeported at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] [[United States|(USA)]]. The squadron was deactivated in July 1922.\n\n===1939-1945===\nIn April 1939, DesRon 7 was reactivated at [[Naval Base San Diego]], [[California]]. In December 1940, the squadron was reformed at [[Naval Station Newport]], [[Rhode Island]]. It was equipped with newly built [[Benson-class destroyer|''Benson''-]] and [[Gleaves-class destroyer|''Gleaves''-class]] [[Destroyer|destroyers]] between June and September 1940.\nIn December 1940, DesRon 7 consisted of the Destroyer Divisons (DesDiv) 13 and 14 with the following ships:\n*{{USS|Plunkett|DD-431}}, flag\n*Destroyer Division 13\n**{{USS|Benson|DD-421}}\n**{{USS|Mayo|DD-422}}\n**{{USS|Gleaves|DD-423}}\n**{{USS|Niblack|DD-424}}, flag\n*Destroyer Division 14\n**{{USS|Madison|DD-425}}\n**{{USS|Lansdale|DD-426}}\n**{{USS|Hilary P. Jones|DD-427}}\n**{{USS|Charles F. Hughes|DD-428}}, flag\n\nBetween March and December 1941, DesRon 7 operated 31 in the \"Atlantic Convoy Support Force\"  from [[Argentia, Newfoundland]] and [[Iceland]] with the [[Wickes-class destroyer|''Wickes''-]] and {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer|1}}s of DesRon 30 and DesRon 31. During these \u201cshort-of-war\u201d operations, ''Niblack'' fired the first U.S. depth charges of the war on 10 April 1941 (on the [[German submarine U-52 (1938)|German submarine ''U-52'']]), while rescuing survivors the Dutch cargo ship ''Saleier''. On 31 October, ''Niblack'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' rescued 45 survivors of {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245}} which was sunk by a torpedo attack from [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[submarine]] [[German submarine U-552|''U-552'']] near Iceland on 31 October 1941. \nOn 3 September 1942, while escorting Convoy TA-18, bound for [[New York City]], a large fire broke out aboard the troop transport {{USS|Wakefield|AP-21}}. ''Mayo'' and the light cruiser {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} closed to windward to take off passengers, a badly-burned officer, and members of the crew not needed to man pumps and hoses. Other survivors were disembarked by boat and raft, to be picked up forthwith by the screening ships, among them ''Niblack'' and ''Hilary P. Jones''. DesRon 7 continued to serve in the Atlantic Ocean until the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in August 1943, when ''Plunkett'' and ''Gleaves'' accepted the surrender of the small island of [[Ustica]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].\n\nThe following month, ''Plunkett'' and the ships of DesDiv 13 operated in the screen of the Southern Attack Force during the [[Allied invasion of Italy]]. On 9 October 1943, ''Gleaves'' and a [[Royal Navy|British]] [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] rescued 57 survivors of {{USS|Buck|DD-420}} which had been sunk by the [[German submarine U-616]] off the coast of [[Salerno]] when it was working in support of [[Operation Avalanche]].\nDesDiv13 (less ''Benson'') operated with the multinational Task Force 81 in \u201cOperation Shingle,\u201d the [[Battle of Anzio|landings at Anzio]], in January 1944. While providing fire support, ''Mayo'' succeeded in breaking up a German counterattack 23 January, before she was heavily damaged by a [[Naval mine|mine]] the following day. ''Plunkett'' suffered major damage from a bomb hit on the same day.\nOn 20 April 1944, ''Lansdale'' was torpedoed and sunk by German bombers off the coast of [[Algeria]] while escorting Convoy UGS-37. ''Gleaves'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' sank the [[German submarine U-616]] with other ships and aircraft off Spain on 17 May 1944. Afterwards they rescued 53 members of her crew. ''Niblack'' and ''Ludlow'' sank the [[German submarine U-960]] north-west of [[Algiers]] with gunfire on 19 May 1944.\n\nIn August and September 1944, DesDiv 13 participated [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of Southern France. ''Hilary P. Jones'' provided gunfire support missions during the assault, but also acted as electronic jamming vessel in the successful attempt to prevent radio-controlled bombs from harassing the area. In the weeks that followed she continued to range up and down the coast in support of the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|First Airborne Task Force]] destroying bridges, gun emplacements, railroad facilities and coastal vessels. She was attacked by a German [[E-boat]] 21 August, but destroyed the craft with gunfire. For her outstanding record during this period the ship received the [[Navy Unit Commendation]]. \n\nConvoy duty and overhauls followed these actions. In the spring of 1945, DesRon 7 was transferred to the [[Pacific War|Pacific Ocean]], where it was mainly engaged in escort duties. ''Benson'', ''Mayo'', ''Madison'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' entered [[Tokyo Bay]] on  2 September 1945 during the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender ceremony]]. Returning to the United States, DesRon 7 was deactivated in November 1945.<ref>{{cite web | title= Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) Seven| url= http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/desron7/ | work= Military | publisher= Destroyer History Foundation | date= 2000-2020 | accessdate=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===1946 - present===\nIn January 1946, DesRon 60 was redesignated DesRon 7. Ships of the squadron participated in [[Operation Crossroads]], the atomic bomb tests at [[Bikini Atoll]]. The squadron saw extended action during the [[Korean War]], including the [[Battle of Inchon]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], the squadron was deployed in support of [[Operation Market Time]] and engaged in shore bombardements.\n\nIn January and February 1979, DesRon 7 participated in the evacuation of Americans from Iran during the [[Iranian Revolution]].

It is assigned to the [[United States Seventh Fleet]].\n\n==Command history==\n\n===1920-1922===\nDestroyer Squadron 7 (DesRon 7) was first established in September 1920 as a reserve squadron of 15 destroyers homeported at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] [[United States|(USA)]]. The squadron was deactivated in July 1922.\n\n===1939-1945===\nIn April 1939, DesRon 7 was reactivated at [[Naval Base San Diego]], [[California]]. In December 1940, the squadron was reformed at [[Naval Station Newport]], [[Rhode Island]]. It was equipped with newly built [[Benson-class destroyer|''Benson''-]] and [[Gleaves-class destroyer|''Gleaves''-class]] [[Destroyer|destroyers]] between June and September 1940.\nIn December 1940, DesRon 7 consisted of the Destroyer Divisons (DesDiv) 13 and 14 with the following ships:\n*{{USS|Plunkett|DD-431}}, flag\n*Destroyer Division 13\n**{{USS|Benson|DD-421}}\n**{{USS|Mayo|DD-422}}\n**{{USS|Gleaves|DD-423}}\n**{{USS|Niblack|DD-424}}, flag\n*Destroyer Division 14\n**{{USS|Madison|DD-425}}\n**{{USS|Lansdale|DD-426}}\n**{{USS|Hilary P. Jones|DD-427}}\n**{{USS|Charles F. Hughes|DD-428}}, flag\n\nBetween March and December 1941, DesRon 7 operated 31 in the \"Atlantic Convoy Support Force\"  from [[Argentia, Newfoundland]] and [[Iceland]] with the [[Wickes-class destroyer|''Wickes''-]] and {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer|1}}s of DesRon 30 and DesRon 31. During these \u201cshort-of-war\u201d operations, ''Niblack'' fired the first U.S. depth charges of the war on 10 April 1941 (on the [[German submarine U-52 (1938)|German submarine ''U-52'']]), while rescuing survivors the Dutch cargo ship ''Saleier''. On 31 October, ''Niblack'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' rescued 45 survivors of {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245}} which was sunk by a torpedo attack from [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[submarine]] [[German submarine U-552|''U-552'']] near Iceland on 31 October 1941. \nOn 3 September 1942, while escorting Convoy TA-18, bound for [[New York City]], a large fire broke out aboard the troop transport {{USS|Wakefield|AP-21}}. ''Mayo'' and the light cruiser {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} closed to windward to take off passengers, a badly-burned officer, and members of the crew not needed to man pumps and hoses. Other survivors were disembarked by boat and raft, to be picked up forthwith by the screening ships, among them ''Niblack'' and ''Hilary P. Jones''. DesRon 7 continued to serve in the Atlantic Ocean until the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in August 1943, when ''Plunkett'' and ''Gleaves'' accepted the surrender of the small island of [[Ustica]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].\n\nThe following month, ''Plunkett'' and the ships of DesDiv 13 operated in the screen of the Southern Attack Force during the [[Allied invasion of Italy]]. On 9 October 1943, ''Gleaves'' and a [[Royal Navy|British]] [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] rescued 57 survivors of {{USS|Buck|DD-420}} which had been sunk by the [[German submarine U-616]] off the coast of [[Salerno]] when it was working in support of [[Operation Avalanche]].\nDesDiv13 (less ''Benson'') operated with the multinational Task Force 81 in \u201cOperation Shingle,\u201d the [[Battle of Anzio|landings at Anzio]], in January 1944. While providing fire support, ''Mayo'' succeeded in breaking up a German counterattack 23 January, before she was heavily damaged by a [[Naval mine|mine]] the following day. ''Plunkett'' suffered major damage from a bomb hit on the same day.\nOn 20 April 1944, ''Lansdale'' was torpedoed and sunk by German bombers off the coast of [[Algeria]] while escorting Convoy UGS-37. ''Gleaves'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' sank the [[German submarine U-616]] with other ships and aircraft off Spain on 17 May 1944. Afterwards they rescued 53 members of her crew. ''Niblack'' and ''Ludlow'' sank the [[German submarine U-960]] north-west of [[Algiers]] with gunfire on 19 May 1944.\n\nIn August and September 1944, DesDiv 13 participated [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of Southern France. ''Hilary P. Jones'' provided gunfire support missions during the assault, but also acted as electronic jamming vessel in the successful attempt to prevent radio-controlled bombs from harassing the area. In the weeks that followed she continued to range up and down the coast in support of the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|First Airborne Task Force]] destroying bridges, gun emplacements, railroad facilities and coastal vessels. She was attacked by a German [[E-boat]] 21 August, but destroyed the craft with gunfire. For her outstanding record during this period the ship received the [[Navy Unit Commendation]]. \n\nConvoy duty and overhauls followed these actions. In the spring of 1945, DesRon 7 was transferred to the [[Pacific War|Pacific Ocean]], where it was mainly engaged in escort duties. ''Benson'', ''Mayo'', ''Madison'' and ''Hilary P. Jones'' entered [[Tokyo Bay]] on  2 September 1945 during the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender ceremony]]. Returning to the United States, DesRon 7 was deactivated in November 1945.<ref>{{cite web | title= Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) Seven| url= http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/desron7/ | work= Military | publisher= Destroyer History Foundation | date= 2000-2020 | accessdate=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===1946 - present===\nIn January 1946, DesRon 60 was redesignated DesRon 7. Ships of the squadron participated in [[Operation Crossroads]], the atomic bomb tests at [[Bikini Atoll]]. The squadron saw extended action during the [[Korean War]], including the [[Battle of Inchon]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], the squadron was deployed in support of [[Operation Market Time]] and engaged in shore bombardements.\n\nIn January and February 1979, DesRon 7 participated in the evacuation of Americans from Iran during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the commander of DesRon 7 acted as the \"North Arabian Gulf Local Anti-Surface Warfare Commander\" and directed multi-national forces in offensive operations which eliminated the [[Iraqi Navy]].\n\nIn 1994-2003, DesRon 7 was assigned the battle group of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Constellation|CV-64}}.
