It is known by a variety of [[common name]]s, including the '''painted slipperycap''', the '''painted suillus''' or the '''red and yellow suillus'''. ''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] history, and is also frequently referred to as ''Suillus pictus'' in the literature. The readily identifiable [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] bears a grayish cottony [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.\n\n''Suillus spraguei'' grows in a [[mycorrhizal]] association with several [[pine]] species, particularly [[eastern white pine]], and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a [[disjunct distribution]], and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]]; opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other ''[[Suillus]]'' species, including the closely related ''[[Suillus decipiens|S.&nbsp;decipiens]]''; the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\n''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history. The first specimen was originally collected in [[New England]] in 1856 by [[Charles James Sprague]], and a formal scientific [[species description|description]] was published in 1872 when [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] called it ''Boletus spraguei''. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] named the species ''Boletus pictus''. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species\u2014''Boletus murraii''\u2014although this was later considered by [[Rolf Singer]] to be merely a younger version of their ''Boletus spraguei''.<ref name=Singer1945/> Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural [[Principle of Priority|priority]] under the rules of [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|fungal naming]].<ref name=Snell1945/> In 1945 Singer reported that the name ''Boletus pictus'' was illegitimate because it was a [[homonym]], already being used for a [[polypore]] mushroom described by [[Carl Friedrich Schultz]] in 1806.<ref name=Singer1945/>{{#tag:ref|According to Streinz (1862), ''Boletus pictus'' Schultz is probably the same species as ''Polyporus perennis'' (L.)

''S.&nbsp;decipiens'' generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from {{convert|4|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and stem that is typically {{convert|4|\u2013|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.7|\u2013|1.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5\u20131&nbsp;mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of [[hazel (color)|hazel]] rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from [[New Jersey]] south to [[Florida]] and west to [[Texas]].<ref>Bessette ''et al.''

''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and [[rhizomorph]]s that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath.<ref name=Randall1986/> The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with [[Pinus classification|white pine]], a grouping of trees classified in [[subgenus]] ''Strobus'' of the genus ''Pinus''.<ref name=Hirose2010/> Under controlled [[pure culture]] conditions in the laboratory, ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' has also been shown to form associations with [[red pine]], [[pitch pine]], and [[loblolly pine]].<ref name=Palm1984/> Asian populations have been associated with [[Korean pine]], [[Chinese white pine]],<ref name=Wu2000/> [[Siberian dwarf pine]] and [[Japanese white pine]].<ref name=Hirose2007/> In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other [[bolete]]s, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July\u2013September),<ref>Bessette ''et al.''

In the [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] stage of ''H.&nbsp;completus'', it appears initially as patches of whitish [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce [[conidia]] (asexual spores). In the [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes [[perithecia]], [[ascus|asci]]-containing sexual structures that produce [[ascospore]]s.

The production of ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random\u2014the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat.<ref name=Kikuchi2003/> The results also suggested that ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low [[forest floor|litter]] accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication.

It is known by a variety of [[common name]]s, including the '''painted slipperycap''', the '''painted suillus''' or the '''red and yellow suillus'''. ''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] history, and is also frequently referred to as ''Suillus pictus'' in the literature. The readily identifiable [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] bears a grayish cottony [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.\n\n''Suillus spraguei'' grows in a [[mycorrhizal]] association with several [[pine]] species, particularly [[eastern white pine]], and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a [[disjunct distribution]], and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]]; opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other ''[[Suillus]]'' species, including the closely related ''[[Suillus decipiens|S.&nbsp;decipiens]]''; the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\n''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history. The first specimen was originally collected in [[New England]] in 1856 by [[Charles James Sprague]], and a formal scientific [[species description|description]] was published in 1872 when [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] called it ''Boletus spraguei''. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] named the species ''Boletus pictus''. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species\u2014''Boletus murraii''\u2014although this was later considered by [[Rolf Singer]] to be merely a younger version of their ''Boletus spraguei''.<ref name=Singer1945/> Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural [[Principle of Priority|priority]] under the rules of [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|fungal naming]].<ref name=Snell1945/> In 1945 Singer reported that the name ''Boletus pictus'' was illegitimate because it was a [[homonym]], already being used for a [[polypore]] mushroom described by [[Carl Friedrich Schultz]] in 1806.<ref name=Singer1945/>{{#tag:ref|According to Streinz (1862), ''Boletus pictus'' Schultz is probably the same species as ''Polyporus perennis'' (L.)

This renders it unlikely to be confused with other species,<ref name=Russell2009/> but it shares similar characteristics with several other ''Suillus'' species. ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete (''[[Suillus ochraceoroseus|S.&nbsp;ochraceoroseus]]''),<ref>Given in the source as ''Fuscoboletinus ochraceoroseus'', but this species has since been transferred to the genus ''Suillus''. See ''[http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=324339 Suillus ochraceoroseus]'' at Index Fungorum.</ref> but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with [[larch]].<ref name=Arora1986/> ''[[Suillus cavipes|S.&nbsp;cavipes]]'', another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk.<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2001), p. 233.</ref> ''[[Suillus lakei|S.&nbsp;lakei]]'' is less brightly colored than ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'', has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with [[Douglas fir]].<ref>Bessette ''et al.''

''S.&nbsp;decipiens'' generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from {{convert|4|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and stem that is typically {{convert|4|\u2013|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.7|\u2013|1.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5\u20131&nbsp;mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of [[hazel (color)|hazel]] rather than reddish to brownish.

''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and [[rhizomorph]]s that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath.<ref name=Randall1986/> The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with [[Pinus classification|white pine]], a grouping of trees classified in [[subgenus]] ''Strobus'' of the genus ''Pinus''.<ref name=Hirose2010/> Under controlled [[pure culture]] conditions in the laboratory, ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' has also been shown to form associations with [[red pine]], [[pitch pine]], and [[loblolly pine]].<ref name=Palm1984/> Asian populations have been associated with [[Korean pine]], [[Chinese white pine]],<ref name=Wu2000/> [[Siberian dwarf pine]] and [[Japanese white pine]].<ref name=Hirose2007/> In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other [[bolete]]s, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July\u2013September),<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2001).</ref> but they may be found as late as October.<ref name=Russell2009/> Mushrooms can be [[parasitism|parasitized]] by the fungus ''[[Hypomyces completus]]''. In the [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] stage of ''H.&nbsp;completus'', it appears initially as patches of whitish [[mold]] on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce [[conidia]] (asexual spores). In the [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes [[perithecia]], [[ascus|asci]]-containing sexual structures that produce [[ascospore]]s. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.<ref name=Rogerson1989/>\n[[File:Hypomyces completus 102175.jpg|thumb|right|The ''S. spraguei'' fruit body on the right is being attacked by the bolete mold ''[[Hypomyces completus]]''.]]\n\nA Japanese field study found that ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' was the dominant fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean pine, both in terms of ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of [[dry matter|dry weight]] of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random\u2014the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat.<ref name=Kikuchi2003/> The results also suggested that ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low [[forest floor|litter]] accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication.

Central vacuum systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, usually installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container.  Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other central vacuum accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms.  Most power hoses usually have a power switch located on the handle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Petit Salon, Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne 48.jpg|thumb|This elegant wall conceals an antique central vacuum inlet (small dark circle in baseboard next to doorway, c.1918)]] \n[[File:Conduit d'aspirateur - Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Antique central vacuum inlet located in a dining room at [[Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne]] ([[Canadian Register of Historic Places]], c. 1918)]]\n\n===19th century===\nThe first introduction of a system similar to a central vacuum cleaner was in the late 19th century.  A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a [[bellows]] chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time.  Because of the machine\u2019s cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, only a few of these units were ever sold in the United States.\n\nIn 1869 Ives McGaffey patented the first portable vacuum cleaner, or \u201csweeping machine\u201d.<ref>{{US patent|91145}}</ref>  The portable [[vacuum cleaner]] is the parent product to the modern central vacuum system.\n\n===20th century===\nIn the 1930s, the development of small, powerful [[electric motors]] increased the popularity and availability of the portable vacuum cleaner, and further diverted consumers from purchasing central cleaners.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the invention of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) thinwall vacuum tubing made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States.  Previously, more-expensive metal tubing was used exclusively, and it may still be used for part or all of an installation, if required by building [[fire code]] regulations.\n\nIn the 1990s, central vacuum systems gained popularity among [[real estate agent]]s and [[home improvement|home remodeler]]s for the value they added to homes at resale.  Allergists also played an important role in the growing popularity of central vacuum systems in the 1990s.\n\n==Health benefits==\nWith central vacuum systems that exhaust completely out of the home, no dust or allergens can be recirculated through the interior air,  as is the case with a traditional vacuum.<ref name=DIY-Vent>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Vent a Central Vacuum System to the Outside|url=https://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-vent-a-central-vacuum-system-to-the-outside|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA 2001 study at [[University of California at Davis]] showed improvements in multiple aspects of health in 25 individuals with a documented history of type I [[hypersensitivity]] to [[house dust]]. Each of these individuals used either a Beam Central Vacuum System or their own conventional vacuum for a period of 3 months. At the end of this period, the individual switched over to the opposite limb of the study for 3 additional months. Interestingly, in all seven domains of the evaluation, including activity, sleep, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotions, use of the central vacuum proved to be superior.<ref name=\"Naguwa\">{{cite journal|last=Naguwa|first=Stanley|author2=Gershwin, M.

The other end of the hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door.<ref name=Klein>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Allison|title=How Central Vacuum Systems Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/central-vacuum1.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>   In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on.  Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via [[radio control|wireless]] signaling.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Inlet.jpg|thumb|When a hose is inserted into an inlet, or the switch on a hose is turned on, two low-voltage electrical contacts (highlighted in red) are bridged, signalling the power unit to turn on]]\nVacuuming is performed in the same manner as with a portable machine.  Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate [[sheer fabric]] curtain). Excess vacuum is \"bled off\" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool.  The bleed port is usually located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.\n\nWhen cleaning is complete, the vacuum hose is removed from the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the vacuum motor).  The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away.\n\n==Dirt separation==\n[[File:Centraldammsugare.jpg|thumb|upright|Central vacuum power unit, with gray utility inlet valve visible at upper right (Sweden)]]\nCyclonic and filtered central vacuum systems are the two main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream.<ref name=\"Klein\" />\n \nTrue [[cyclonic separation|cyclonic]] cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin.  Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction [[tangent]]ial to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]].  Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward to the wall of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to [[gravity]] into the bottom of the collection bin.  For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on \"[[Cyclonic separation]]\".\n\nIn fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration.  A well-designed cyclonic separation system does not lose [[suction power]] due to airflow restriction, until the collection vessel is almost full.  This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which gradually lose suction as pores in the filter become clogged by collected dirt and dust.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nFiltered systems use a wide variety of different bags or filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth bags) or replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis.  Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available.  Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses.\n\nBag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums.  In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room.  Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance.  By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator.  In fact, the only perceivable change may be an ''increase'' in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed.  If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely [[friction|seizes up]] due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings.  Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.\n\nFilterless central vacuums are completely immune to such failures.  In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called \"bypass cooling\", using a completely separate source of ambient air to cool the motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function.\n\nHybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical [[clothes dryer]] exhaust.\n\n==Tools and accessories==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Zentralstaubsaugerrohr.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum cleaning tools and hose (partially covered by a protective gray \"hose sock\")]]\n[[File:\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7 \u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6\u05d9- \u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \"\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd\" \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Baseboard-level vacuum dustpan inlet (Israel)]]\nCentral vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or [[turbine]]) systems are frequently less expensive since they do not require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet.  Turbine-driven brushes tend to be louder than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the \"vacuum whine\" produced by a portable vacuum. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.\n\nThe average standard central vacuum system is equipped with a 30&nbsp;foot (9&nbsp;m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners.  For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or on the back of a door.\n\nAn alternative for storing vacuum hose is the \"Hide-A-Hose\" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage.  Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50&nbsp;ft (9/12/15&nbsp;m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage.<ref name=HideHose>{{cite web|title=Hide-A-Hose System|url=http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|work=Vacuflo.com|publisher=H-P Products, Inc.|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820234114/http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|archivedate=2011-08-20}}</ref> A scaled-down 10-foot (3&nbsp;m) version (such as \"Spot by Vroom\") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms.  The original \"Vroom\" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24&nbsp;ft (7.3&nbsp;m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.\n\nA modular vacuum hose called \"QuickClick\" is available in 10/15/20&nbsp;foot (3/4.5/6&nbsp;m) lengths, allowing a custom-length hose to be quickly set up or taken apart by an end user. In addition, a promotional article in a trade magazine{{which|date=March 2013}} says that [[arthritis|arthritic]] testers were able to connect and disconnect the hose in spite of their disability.\n\nAutomatic dustpans (e.g. \"Vacpan\" or \"KickSweep\") can be installed in the [[Kick space |kickspace]] under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard [[broom]] to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=DIY-Vacpan>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=Central Vacuum Automatic Dustpan|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/central-vacuum-automatic-dustpan#.UVnFzr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=VacPan>{{cite web|title=VacPan, VacPan II, and VacuSweep|url=http://builtinvacuum.com/vacpan.html|work=builtinvacuum.com [website]|publisher=M.D. Manufacturing, Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Alternatively, a \"DrawerVac\" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface.\n \nThe \"VacnSeal\" is an accessory intended to be installed on the underside of a [[kitchen cabinet]], over a countertop used for food preparation. The nozzle of the device is used to evacuate excess air from a [[Zipper storage bag|zipper lock plastic food storage bag]] (e.g. Ziploc), which is said by the manufacturer to preserve food freshness for a longer period of time.<ref name=VacnSeal>{{cite web|title=VacnSeal Homepage|url=http://vacnseal.com/index.php|work=VacnSeal Convenient Food Preserver|publisher=M.D. Manufacturing, Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901025005/http://vacnseal.com/index.php|archivedate=2011-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\n[[File:Avl\u00f8psventil for sentralst\u00f8vsuger.jpg|thumb|upright|Central vacuum exhaust on building exterior (Norway)]]\n* Increased suction power \u2014 Because the vacuum cleaner motor and dirt collection system need not be portable, the weight and size of the unit are not as severely limited compared to a portable system; some units even use two motors for extra power.<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Francesca|title=Central Vacuum Systems - Should You or Shouldn't You?|url=http://www.diylife.com/2010/11/09/central-vacuum-systems/|work=DIY Life|publisher=AOL, Inc.|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728201835/https://www.diylife.com/2010/11/09/central-vacuum-systems|archivedate=28 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Donovan\" />   In addition, bagless filterless systems avoid the inevitable loss of suction in filtered systems caused by collected dust clogging the filters.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n* Ability to handle \"difficult\" debris \u2014 Central vacuums, especially filterless models, can efficiently remove difficult dry substances, such as [[plaster]] dust, spilled [[flour]], [[laser printer]] [[toner]], metal [[knockout punch|knockout slugs]], and wire clippings from electrical work, or even small pieces and slivers of broken glass. This ability may depend on the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. \"Wet vacuum interceptor\" accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These \"wet vac\" units are subject to the same limitations as \"wet-or-dry [[Shop vac|shop vacuums]]\", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] growth. However, toxic materials, such as [[asbestos]] should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.\n* Complete removal of [[allergen]]s and noxious [[odor]]s \u2014 Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" />  This contrasts with the well-known acrid \"vacuum smell\" of [[fine dust]] and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum.  Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors.  An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard [[clothes dryer]] appliance vent.\n* Low [[acoustic noise]] \u2014 Well-designed central vacuums are very quiet at the point of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space.  This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=Donovan>{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Dave|title=The Many Benefits of Central Vacuum Systems|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac#.UVnEOr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209000107/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac|archivedate=9 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* Convenient cleaning \u2014  Setup, use, and storage of a vacuum hose and cleaning tool can be quick and efficient.  Cleaning stairways is much easier without having to balance a heavy, hot appliance on each step, and coping with both an electrical cord and a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n* Infrequent emptying \u2014 Central vacuums can usually accumulate up to 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;pounds) or more of dirt and dust before requiring disposal.  This is an unavoidable dirty process that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year.  Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though care must be taken to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n* Low consumables cost \u2014 For filterless systems, there are no ongoing costs, other than occasionally replacing a worn-out motor brush or vacuum hose.\n* Compatible with standard tools and accessories \u2014 Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners.  In the United States, the [[de facto standard]] size is 1-1/4&nbsp;inch (3.175&nbsp;cm) inside diameter for tools.  For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to \"bleed off\" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.\n* Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls \u2014 There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming.  Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />  To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven \"hose sock\" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose.\n* Durable equipment \u2014 Good-quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /> Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects.  Many manufacturers give a \"Lifetime Limited Warranty\" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost.  In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1,000.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.\n\nA central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners a permanent [[fixture (property law)|fixture]] of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing and electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement was made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the [[property value]] of a residence or commercial property.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:ZentralStaubsaugAnlage.jpg|thumb|In-wall vacuum inlet valve; Central power unit; Bagless dirt collection canister and auxiliary filter (click on photo to enlarge)]]\nCentral vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2\u20134 times per year.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling.  For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust.\n\nFilterless cyclonic separation systems only require emptying the dirt collection container before the suction drops off as an almost-full condition is reached.  Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature [[translucent]] dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.\n\nRegardless of which dirt separation system is used, the electric motor may require lubrication of its [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, or replacement of [[carbon brushes]] on an infrequent basis, usually measured in years.<ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was improperly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs).<ref name=DIY-Maint>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=General Central Vacuum Maintenance|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance#.UVnMw7-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622025813/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance|archivedate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction,<ref name=DIY-Unclog>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Unclog a Central Vacuum System|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-unclog-a-central-vacuum-system#.UVnH7L-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs.

The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] than any other bends in the system.  This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove.  Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).\n\nThe wall inlets are connected to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air [[duct (HVAC)|return ducts]] (if permitted by [[building code]]).  In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a \"rough-in\" phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, [[HVAC]], electrical, etc.), and just before [[drywall]], paneling, or other surface finishes are installed.  Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed ''before'' cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing.  In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.\n\nVacuum tubing systems may be installed by [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s, specialized contractors, or even [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] (DIY) homeowners.<ref name=Guertin>{{cite journal|last=Guertin|first=Mike|title=You Can Install a Central Vac|journal=Fine Homebuilding|date=November 2011|issue=222|pages=64\u201367|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|issn=1096-360X}}</ref><ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRetrofitting of vacuum tubing in existing structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, depending on the anatomy of the building.  A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt.  Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially if it is a filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Floor Inlet.jpg|thumb|[[Metal]] floor inlets are used in locations in existing structures where it would be impossible or impractical to install standard wall inlets]]\n\nA typical house requires 2\u20134 inlets per floor, although many users find the central vacuum so convenient that they later install additional inlets in the basement, attic, garage, and even on the back porch (for vacuuming car interiors, storage sheds, etc.). A rough rule of thumb is one inlet per {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of floor area.<ref name=\"Klein\" />  Inlets should be placed in convenient locations unlikely to be blocked by open doors or furniture, such as in central hallways. A non-stretchable cord of appropriate length (or a thin wire on an [[Architectural drawing|architectural scale drawing]]) can be used to check for adequate reach of a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nRouting and design of vacuum tubing layout is very similar to [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) plumbing, with the exception that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required.  Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages.  Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal \"running start\". In some jurisdictions, [[fire code]] regulations require that an [[firestop|intumescent firestop collar]] be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a [[Firewall (construction)|firewall]].  If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external [[pipe insulation]] to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.<ref name=BeamMan>{{cite web|title=Do-It-Yourself Installation Manual|url=http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|work=Beam Central Vacuum Systems|publisher=Electrolux Home Care Products|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017134705/http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|archivedate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or \"[[Schedule 20]]\") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller {{convert|1+13/16|in|cm|adj=on}} tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog.  However, that manufacturer has also switched to the [[de facto standard|de facto industry standard]] size of {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings.  In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system.  Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary.\n\nAnother tubing option, which is becoming popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is \"[[Schedule 40]]\" standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs are exposed to mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to {{convert|2+3/8|in|cm}}, requiring fittings designed for this.  To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central vacuum inlets and power unit.\n\nOccasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to preinstall vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Central vacuum cleaners}}\n{{portal|Technology}}\n* [[List of vacuum cleaners]]\n* [[Pneumatic refuse conveying system]] \u2014 larger central vacuum systems used to dispose of industrial or municipal rubbish\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Central Vacuum Cleaner}}\n[[Category:Vacuum cleaners]]\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Cana-Vac 250-E Central Vacuum.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum power unit retrofitted in a 1929 [[Canadian]] house]]\n[[File:Central vacuum system.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical central vacuum cleaner power unit for residential use (North America)]]\n\nA '''central vacuum cleaner''' (also known as '''built-in''' or '''ducted''') is a type of [[vacuum cleaner]] appliance, installed into a building as a semi-permanent fixture. Central vacuum systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, usually installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container.  Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other central vacuum accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms.  Most power hoses usually have a power switch located on the handle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Petit Salon, Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne 48.jpg|thumb|This elegant wall conceals an antique central vacuum inlet (small dark circle in baseboard next to doorway, c.1918)]] \n[[File:Conduit d'aspirateur - Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Antique central vacuum inlet located in a dining room at [[Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne]] ([[Canadian Register of Historic Places]], c. 1918)]]\n\n===19th century===\nThe first introduction of a system similar to a central vacuum cleaner was in the late 19th century.  A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a [[bellows]] chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time.  Because of the machine\u2019s cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, only a few of these units were ever sold in the United States.\n\nIn 1869 Ives McGaffey patented the first portable vacuum cleaner, or \u201csweeping machine\u201d.<ref>{{US patent|91145}}</ref>  The portable [[vacuum cleaner]] is the parent product to the modern central vacuum system.\n\n===20th century===\nIn the 1930s, the development of small, powerful [[electric motors]] increased the popularity and availability of the portable vacuum cleaner, and further diverted consumers from purchasing central cleaners.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the invention of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) thinwall vacuum tubing made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States.  Previously, more-expensive metal tubing was used exclusively, and it may still be used for part or all of an installation, if required by building [[fire code]] regulations.\n\nIn the 1990s, central vacuum systems gained popularity among [[real estate agent]]s and [[home improvement|home remodeler]]s for the value they added to homes at resale.  Allergists also played an important role in the growing popularity of central vacuum systems in the 1990s.\n\n==Health benefits==\nWith central vacuum systems that exhaust completely out of the home, no dust or allergens can be recirculated through the interior air,  as is the case with a traditional vacuum.<ref name=DIY-Vent>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Vent a Central Vacuum System to the Outside|url=https://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-vent-a-central-vacuum-system-to-the-outside|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA 2001 study at [[University of California at Davis]] showed improvements in multiple aspects of health in 25 individuals with a documented history of type I [[hypersensitivity]] to [[house dust]].

The other end of the hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door.<ref name=Klein>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Allison|title=How Central Vacuum Systems Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/central-vacuum1.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>   In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on.  Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via [[radio control|wireless]] signaling.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Inlet.jpg|thumb|When a hose is inserted into an inlet, or the switch on a hose is turned on, two low-voltage electrical contacts (highlighted in red) are bridged, signalling the power unit to turn on]]\nVacuuming is performed in the same manner as with a portable machine.  Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate [[sheer fabric]] curtain). Excess vacuum is \"bled off\" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool.  The bleed port is usually located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.\n\nWhen cleaning is complete, the vacuum hose is removed from the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the vacuum motor).  The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away.\n\n==Dirt separation==\n[[File:Centraldammsugare.jpg|thumb|upright|Central vacuum power unit, with gray utility inlet valve visible at upper right (Sweden)]]\nCyclonic and filtered central vacuum systems are the two main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream.<ref name=\"Klein\" />\n \nTrue [[cyclonic separation|cyclonic]] cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin.  Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction [[tangent]]ial to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]].  Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward to the wall of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to [[gravity]] into the bottom of the collection bin.  For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on \"[[Cyclonic separation]]\".\n\nIn fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration.  A well-designed cyclonic separation system does not lose [[suction power]] due to airflow restriction, until the collection vessel is almost full.  This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which gradually lose suction as pores in the filter become clogged by collected dirt and dust.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nFiltered systems use a wide variety of different bags or filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth bags) or replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis.  Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available.  Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses.\n\nBag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums.  In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room.  Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance.  By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator.  In fact, the only perceivable change may be an ''increase'' in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed.  If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely [[friction|seizes up]] due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings.  Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.\n\nFilterless central vacuums are completely immune to such failures.  In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called \"bypass cooling\", using a completely separate source of ambient air to cool the motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function.\n\nHybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical [[clothes dryer]] exhaust.\n\n==Tools and accessories==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Zentralstaubsaugerrohr.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum cleaning tools and hose (partially covered by a protective gray \"hose sock\")]]\n[[File:\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7 \u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6\u05d9- \u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \"\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd\" \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Baseboard-level vacuum dustpan inlet (Israel)]]\nCentral vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or [[turbine]]) systems are frequently less expensive since they do not require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet.  Turbine-driven brushes tend to be louder than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the \"vacuum whine\" produced by a portable vacuum. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.\n\nThe average standard central vacuum system is equipped with a 30&nbsp;foot (9&nbsp;m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners.  For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or on the back of a door.\n\nAn alternative for storing vacuum hose is the \"Hide-A-Hose\" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage.  Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50&nbsp;ft (9/12/15&nbsp;m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage.<ref name=HideHose>{{cite web|title=Hide-A-Hose System|url=http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|work=Vacuflo.com|publisher=H-P Products, Inc.|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820234114/http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|archivedate=2011-08-20}}</ref> A scaled-down 10-foot (3&nbsp;m) version (such as \"Spot by Vroom\") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms.  The original \"Vroom\" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24&nbsp;ft (7.3&nbsp;m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.\n\nA modular vacuum hose called \"QuickClick\" is available in 10/15/20&nbsp;foot (3/4.5/6&nbsp;m) lengths, allowing a custom-length hose to be quickly set up or taken apart by an end user. In addition, a promotional article in a trade magazine{{which|date=March 2013}} says that [[arthritis|arthritic]] testers were able to connect and disconnect the hose in spite of their disability.\n\nAutomatic dustpans (e.g. \"Vacpan\" or \"KickSweep\") can be installed in the [[Kick space |kickspace]] under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard [[broom]] to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=DIY-Vacpan>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=Central Vacuum Automatic Dustpan|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/central-vacuum-automatic-dustpan#.UVnFzr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=VacPan>{{cite web|title=VacPan, VacPan II, and VacuSweep|url=http://builtinvacuum.com/vacpan.html|work=builtinvacuum.com [website]|publisher=M.D. Manufacturing, Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Alternatively, a \"DrawerVac\" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface.\n \nThe \"VacnSeal\" is an accessory intended to be installed on the underside of a [[kitchen cabinet]], over a countertop used for food preparation.

This ability may depend on the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. \"Wet vacuum interceptor\" accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These \"wet vac\" units are subject to the same limitations as \"wet-or-dry [[Shop vac|shop vacuums]]\", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and [[mold]] growth. However, toxic materials, such as [[asbestos]] should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.\n* Complete removal of [[allergen]]s and noxious [[odor]]s \u2014 Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" />  This contrasts with the well-known acrid \"vacuum smell\" of [[fine dust]] and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum.  Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors.  An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard [[clothes dryer]] appliance vent.\n* Low [[acoustic noise]] \u2014 Well-designed central vacuums are very quiet at the point of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space.  This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=Donovan>{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Dave|title=The Many Benefits of Central Vacuum Systems|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac#.UVnEOr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209000107/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac|archivedate=9 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* Convenient cleaning \u2014  Setup, use, and storage of a vacuum hose and cleaning tool can be quick and efficient.  Cleaning stairways is much easier without having to balance a heavy, hot appliance on each step, and coping with both an electrical cord and a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n* Infrequent emptying \u2014 Central vacuums can usually accumulate up to 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;pounds) or more of dirt and dust before requiring disposal.  This is an unavoidable dirty process that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year.  Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though care must be taken to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n* Low consumables cost \u2014 For filterless systems, there are no ongoing costs, other than occasionally replacing a worn-out motor brush or vacuum hose.\n* Compatible with standard tools and accessories \u2014 Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners.  In the United States, the [[de facto standard]] size is 1-1/4&nbsp;inch (3.175&nbsp;cm) inside diameter for tools.  For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to \"bleed off\" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.\n* Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls \u2014 There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming.  Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />  To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven \"hose sock\" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose.\n* Durable equipment \u2014 Good-quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /> Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects.  Many manufacturers give a \"Lifetime Limited Warranty\" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost.  In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1,000.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.\n\nA central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners a permanent [[fixture (property law)|fixture]] of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing and electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement was made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the [[property value]] of a residence or commercial property.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:ZentralStaubsaugAnlage.jpg|thumb|In-wall vacuum inlet valve; Central power unit; Bagless dirt collection canister and auxiliary filter (click on photo to enlarge)]]\nCentral vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2\u20134 times per year.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling.  For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust.\n\nFilterless cyclonic separation systems only require emptying the dirt collection container before the suction drops off as an almost-full condition is reached.  Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature [[translucent]] dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.\n\nRegardless of which dirt separation system is used, the electric motor may require lubrication of its [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, or replacement of [[carbon brushes]] on an infrequent basis, usually measured in years.<ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was improperly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs).<ref name=DIY-Maint>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=General Central Vacuum Maintenance|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance#.UVnMw7-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622025813/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance|archivedate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction,<ref name=DIY-Unclog>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Unclog a Central Vacuum System|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-unclog-a-central-vacuum-system#.UVnH7L-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs.

The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] than any other bends in the system.  This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove.  Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).\n\nThe wall inlets are connected to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air [[duct (HVAC)|return ducts]] (if permitted by [[building code]]).  In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a \"rough-in\" phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, [[HVAC]], electrical, etc.), and just before [[drywall]], paneling, or other surface finishes are installed.  Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed ''before'' cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing.  In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.\n\nVacuum tubing systems may be installed by [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s, specialized contractors, or even [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] (DIY) homeowners.<ref name=Guertin>{{cite journal|last=Guertin|first=Mike|title=You Can Install a Central Vac|journal=Fine Homebuilding|date=November 2011|issue=222|pages=64\u201367|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|issn=1096-360X}}</ref><ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRetrofitting of vacuum tubing in existing structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, depending on the anatomy of the building.  A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt.  Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially if it is a filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Floor Inlet.jpg|thumb|[[Metal]] floor inlets are used in locations in existing structures where it would be impossible or impractical to install standard wall inlets]]\n\nA typical house requires 2\u20134 inlets per floor, although many users find the central vacuum so convenient that they later install additional inlets in the basement, attic, garage, and even on the back porch (for vacuuming car interiors, storage sheds, etc.). A rough rule of thumb is one inlet per {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of floor area.<ref name=\"Klein\" />  Inlets should be placed in convenient locations unlikely to be blocked by open doors or furniture, such as in central hallways. A non-stretchable cord of appropriate length (or a thin wire on an [[Architectural drawing|architectural scale drawing]]) can be used to check for adequate reach of a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nRouting and design of vacuum tubing layout is very similar to [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) plumbing, with the exception that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required.  Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages.  Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal \"running start\". In some jurisdictions, [[fire code]] regulations require that an [[firestop|intumescent firestop collar]] be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a [[Firewall (construction)|firewall]].  If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external [[pipe insulation]] to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.<ref name=BeamMan>{{cite web|title=Do-It-Yourself Installation Manual|url=http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|work=Beam Central Vacuum Systems|publisher=Electrolux Home Care Products|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017134705/http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|archivedate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or \"[[Schedule 20]]\") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller {{convert|1+13/16|in|cm|adj=on}} tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog.  However, that manufacturer has also switched to the [[de facto standard|de facto industry standard]] size of {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings.  In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system.  Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary.\n\nAnother tubing option, which is becoming popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is \"[[Schedule 40]]\" standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs are exposed to mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to {{convert|2+3/8|in|cm}}, requiring fittings designed for this.  To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central vacuum inlets and power unit.\n\nOccasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to preinstall vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Central vacuum cleaners}}\n{{portal|Technology}}\n* [[List of vacuum cleaners]]\n* [[Pneumatic refuse conveying system]] \u2014 larger central vacuum systems used to dispose of industrial or municipal rubbish\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Central Vacuum Cleaner}}\n[[Category:Vacuum cleaners]]\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_vacuum_cleaner"}

The festival was programmed each March the week prior to the music portion of [[SXSW]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n35 Denton was organized by a core staff of volunteers. The music festival has featured many nationally touring acts, such as [[The Pains of Being Pure At Heart]], [[Local Natives]], [[Portugal. The Man]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[The Mountain Goats]], [[Bun B]], [[Devin the Dude]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Big Boi]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[The Civil Wars]], [[Best Coast]], [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]], [[A Place to Bury Strangers]], and more. Likewise, it also had a roster of notable local acts, such as [[Neon Indian]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Riverboat Gamblers]], [[Seryn]], and more.\n\n==History==\n'''2005 \u2013 2008: The Austin Years'''\n\nDuring SXSW 2005, festival founder Chris Flemmons planted the seeds of 35 Denton in the soil of Big Red Sun, a floral design boutique in Austin. Thirteen Denton acts performed on a stage in the business's outdoor garden for an invite-only crowd of international journalists and industry types. The beer was free, the Tex-Mex was homemade, and the goal was uncomplicated: Show the world what Denton's all about. Flemmons called the event NX35: The Afternoon Party of the Other, Smaller, Music Town in Texas. In 2006, it took place at Club DeVille, and in 2007 and 2008, the party moved to Momo's. Some notable performers from the event's years in Austin include Centro-matic's [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], and the [[Baptist Generals]].\n\n'''2009 \u2013 Present: The Denton Years'''\n\nIn 2009, after four years in Austin, Flemmons and a small staff of volunteers brought the day party home and turned it into a multi-day festival. The goal of showcasing Denton's performers and people did not change, but the name did: NX35 Music Conferette, which opened with a keynote address  led by [[American Splendor]] creator [[Harvey Pekar]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Waters |first=Erin |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2009/03/yesterday_at_nx35_a_conversation_about_jazz_with_harvey_pekar.php |title=Yesterday at NX35: A Conversation About Jazz with Harvey Pekar |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2017-07-27}}</ref> Before the inaugural festival ended, more than 4000 people had watched over 120 acts play on the stages of Denton's numerous clubs and coffeeshops.\n\nIn 2010, more than 250 acts performed on and around Denton's downtown square \u2013 to an estimated audience of 20,000 people.

Also instituted this year was daytime programming with speakers and panels addressing a broad range of topics concerning cultural planning, urban development, gender issues, tech entrepreneurship, and the music, art, and film industries. This programming emerged as one of the recurring highlights of the festival. Other notable performers from this era include [[Neon Indian]], [[Centro-matic]], [[Health (band)|HEALTH]], [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], [[Baptist Generals|The Baptist Generals]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Monotonix]], [[The Riverboat Gamblers|Riverboat Gamblers]], Shiny Around the Edges, and [[True Widow]].\n\nIn 2011, the festival changed its name to 35 Conferette. The name wasn't the only big change, as the fest expanded into the streets of downtown Denton with the addition of three outdoor stages, one of which was on the courthouse lawn. Performers included a growing roster of national talent like [[Big Boi]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Japanther]], and [[Damien Jurado]]. In the months that followed, 35 Conferette was named Best Promotional Event of 2011 by the Texas Downtown Association. Festival founder Chris Flemmons handed the event's future to a new leadership staff led by Creative Director Kyle La Valley and Programming Director, Natalie D\u00e1vila. The festival's name changed to 35 Denton in July 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/the-scene/events/Denton-Music-Fest-Changes-Name-125085534.html|title=Denton Music Fest Changes Name|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, 35 Denton was headlined by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] \u2013 though they performed a few days later than anticipated. After visa issues prevented their Saturday night appearance, the band played the following Wednesday at the North Texas Fairgrounds, with [[Ty Segall]] as an opening act.

The festival was programmed each March the week prior to the music portion of [[SXSW]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n35 Denton was organized by a core staff of volunteers. The music festival has featured many nationally touring acts, such as [[The Pains of Being Pure At Heart]], [[Local Natives]], [[Portugal. The Man]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[The Mountain Goats]], [[Bun B]], [[Devin the Dude]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Big Boi]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[The Civil Wars]], [[Best Coast]], [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]], [[A Place to Bury Strangers]], and more. Likewise, it also had a roster of notable local acts, such as [[Neon Indian]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Riverboat Gamblers]], [[Seryn]], and more.\n\n==History==\n'''2005 \u2013 2008: The Austin Years'''\n\nDuring SXSW 2005, festival founder Chris Flemmons planted the seeds of 35 Denton in the soil of Big Red Sun, a floral design boutique in Austin. Thirteen Denton acts performed on a stage in the business's outdoor garden for an invite-only crowd of international journalists and industry types. The beer was free, the Tex-Mex was homemade, and the goal was uncomplicated: Show the world what Denton's all about. Flemmons called the event NX35: The Afternoon Party of the Other, Smaller, Music Town in Texas. In 2006, it took place at Club DeVille, and in 2007 and 2008, the party moved to Momo's. Some notable performers from the event's years in Austin include Centro-matic's [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], and the [[Baptist Generals]].\n\n'''2009 \u2013 Present: The Denton Years'''\n\nIn 2009, after four years in Austin, Flemmons and a small staff of volunteers brought the day party home and turned it into a multi-day festival. The goal of showcasing Denton's performers and people did not change, but the name did: NX35 Music Conferette, which opened with a keynote address  led by [[American Splendor]] creator [[Harvey Pekar]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Waters |first=Erin |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2009/03/yesterday_at_nx35_a_conversation_about_jazz_with_harvey_pekar.php |title=Yesterday at NX35: A Conversation About Jazz with Harvey Pekar |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2017-07-27}}</ref> Before the inaugural festival ended, more than 4000 people had watched over 120 acts play on the stages of Denton's numerous clubs and coffeeshops.\n\nIn 2010, more than 250 acts performed on and around Denton's downtown square \u2013 to an estimated audience of 20,000 people. The event began with keynote speaker [[Steve Albini]] and featured a now storied<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/north-by-unrest-chris-flemmons-wants-to-put-denton-music-on-the-map-with-nx35-if-it-doesnt-kill-him-first-6406254|title=North by Unrest: Chris Flemmons Wants To Put Denton Music on the Map With NX35-If it Doesn't Kill Him First|last=Rodrigue|first=Daniel|date=2010-03-11|access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref> free Saturday night performance by the [[Flaming Lips]] and Denton's own Midlake at the North Texas Fairgrounds. Also instituted this year was daytime programming with speakers and panels addressing a broad range of topics concerning cultural planning, urban development, gender issues, tech entrepreneurship, and the music, art, and film industries. This programming emerged as one of the recurring highlights of the festival. Other notable performers from this era include [[Neon Indian]], [[Centro-matic]], Health, [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], [[Baptist Generals|The Baptist Generals]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Monotonix]], [[The Riverboat Gamblers|Riverboat Gamblers]], Shiny Around the Edges, and [[True Widow]].\n\nIn 2011, the festival changed its name to 35 Conferette. The name wasn't the only big change, as the fest expanded into the streets of downtown Denton with the addition of three outdoor stages, one of which was on the courthouse lawn. Performers included a growing roster of national talent like [[Big Boi]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Japanther]], and [[Damien Jurado]]. In the months that followed, 35 Conferette was named Best Promotional Event of 2011 by the Texas Downtown Association. Festival founder Chris Flemmons handed the event's future to a new leadership staff led by Creative Director Kyle La Valley and Programming Director, Natalie D\u00e1vila. The festival's name changed to 35 Denton in July 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/the-scene/events/Denton-Music-Fest-Changes-Name-125085534.html|title=Denton Music Fest Changes Name|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, 35 Denton was headlined by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] \u2013 though they performed a few days later than anticipated. After visa issues prevented their Saturday night appearance, the band played the following Wednesday at the North Texas Fairgrounds, with [[Ty Segall]] as an opening act. Other notable 2012 acts included [[Built to Spill]], [[Bun B]], [[The Raincoats]], OM, [[Best Coast]], [[Oh Sees|Thee Oh Sees]], and [[Dum Dum Girls]].[[File:Flaming Lips at NX35 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Flaming Lips]] performing a free show during NX35 2010]]In 2013, 35 Denton featured performances by [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], Sleep, [[Roky Erickson]], [[Com Truise]], [[Silver Apples]], [[Killer Mike]], [[Thee Oh Sees]], [[Akron/Family]], [[Man Man]], [[Mikal Cronin]], [[Mac DeMarco]], [[Beach Fossils]], [[Reigning Sound]], [[Marnie Stern]], [[Soul Clap]], and the live Texas debut of [[Thurston Moore]]'s side-project [[Chelsea Light Moving]].\n\nAfter 2013, La Valley and D\u00e1vila left the festival leadership and the organization's primary investors withdrew funding.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/entertainment/the-scene/35-Denton-at-Risk-as-Staff--Financial-Backer-Part-Ways-214221121.html|title=35 Denton at Risk as Staff and Financial Backer Part Ways|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref> The festival did not take place in 2014, opting instead to take a year off to reorganize and locate new investors. During this time, a new Denton music festival in [http://oaktopiafest.com Oaktopia] was formed to run opposite 35 Denton in the fall of each year.\n\nIn 2015, 35 Denton returned under the theme \"Back To The Music\", and featured performances by the 1970s [[The Zombies]], [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]], [[Cymbals Eat Guitars]], [[Chastity Belt (band)]], [[Lowell (musician)]], S U R V I V E, and the reunion performance of [[Ten Hands (band)]] led by local musician Paul Slavens.\n\nIn 2016, was headlined by the soul artist [[Charles Bradley (singer)]] and his Extraordinaires, hip-hop throwback [[Biz Markie]], and [[Eliot Sumner]], the child of English rock musician [[Sting (musician)]]. Other notable performances were by [[Electric Six]], [[Fat Tony (rapper)]], [[Class Actress]], [[Tacocat]], [[Sheer Mag]], Alesia Lani and the [[Mydolls]].\n\nThe 2017 event was canceled without firm plans to revive the festival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guidelive.com/music/2017/02/06/official-35-denton-music-festival-canceled|title=It's official: 35 Denton music festival is not happening this year|date=2017-02-06|work=GuideLive|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution of a brand ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Nx35 2009.jpg|NX35 Music Conferette 2009 Banner with Logo\nFile:NX35 2009.jpg|NX35 Music Conferette 2010 Banner with Logo\nFile:35 Conferette Logo 2011.png|35 Conferette 2011 Logo\nFile:35 Denton Logo 2012.jpg|35 Denton Music Festival 2012 Logo\nFile:35 Denton 2013.jpg|35 Denton Music Festival 2013 Logo\nFile:35 Denton Logo 2016.png|35 Denton Music Festival 2016 Logo\n</gallery>A unique aspect of the festival is its evolving name and image; each change coming from a different impetus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2011/07/the-road-to-35-the-meaning-and-reasons-behind-a-festivals-various-name-changes/|title=The Road to 35: The Meaning and Reasons Behind A Festival\u2019s Various Name-Changes \u2013 D Magazine|website=www.dmagazine.com|access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==Lineups By Year==\n\n===2009 NX35 Conferette, March 12\u201315===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1600px;\"\n|-\n|{{Show|Performing Artists:|{{Col-beg}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n*[[Brave Combo]]\n*[[Centro-matic]]\n*[[Possessed by Paul James]]\n*[[Monotonix]]\n*[[James McMurtry]]\n*[[Casiotone for the Painfully Alone]]\n*[[Sarah Jaffe]]\n*[[Tomorrowpeople]]\n*[[True Widow]]\n*[[Spectacle (band)]]\n*The A.M.

Owens was ranked by [[ESPN]] as the sixth greatest North American athlete of the 20th century and the highest-ranked in his sport. In 1999, he was on the six-man short-list for the BBC's [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year#Sports Personality of the Century Award|Sports Personality of the Century]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJesse Owens, originally known as ''J.C.'', was the youngest of ten children (three girls and seven boys) born to Henry Cleveland Owens (a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]]) and Mary Emma Fitzgerald in [[Oakville, Alabama]], on September 12, 1913. At the age of nine, he and his family moved to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], for better opportunities, as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when 1.5 million African Americans left the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] South for the urban and industrial North. When his new teacher asked his name (to enter in her roll book), he said \"J.C.\", but because of his strong Southern accent, she thought he said \"Jesse\". The name stuck, and he was known as Jesse Owens for the rest of his life.<ref>Baker, William J. ''Jesse Owens \u2013 An American Life'', p.19.</ref>\n\nAs a youth, Owens took different menial jobs in his spare time: He delivered groceries, loaded freight cars and worked in a shoe repair shop while his father and older brother worked at a steel mill.<ref name=jobio2>{{cite web |url=http://www.jesseowens.com/jobio2.html |title=? |publisher=|access-date=April 5, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703064033/http://www.jesseowens.com/jobio2.html |archivedate=July 3, 2007}}</ref> During this period, Owens realized that he had a passion for running. Throughout his life, Owens attributed the success of his athletic career to the encouragement of Charles Riley, his [[Middle school|junior high school]] track coach at Fairmount Junior High School. Since Owens worked in a shoe repair shop after school, Riley allowed him to practice before school instead.\n\nOwens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) met at Fairmont Junior High School in Cleveland when he was 15 and she was 13. They dated steadily through high school. Ruth gave birth to their first daughter, Gloria, in 1932. They married on July 5, 1935 and had two more daughters together\u2014Marlene, born in 1937, and Beverly, born in 1940.

Owens was ranked by [[ESPN]] as the sixth greatest North American athlete of the 20th century and the highest-ranked in his sport. In 1999, he was on the six-man short-list for the BBC's [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year#Sports Personality of the Century Award|Sports Personality of the Century]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJesse Owens, originally known as ''J.C.'', was the youngest of ten children (three girls and seven boys) born to Henry Cleveland Owens (a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]]) and Mary Emma Fitzgerald in [[Oakville, Alabama]], on September 12, 1913. At the age of nine, he and his family moved to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], for better opportunities, as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when 1.5 million African Americans left the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] South for the urban and industrial North. When his new teacher asked his name (to enter in her roll book), he said \"J.C.\", but because of his strong Southern accent, she thought he said \"Jesse\". The name stuck, and he was known as Jesse Owens for the rest of his life.<ref>Baker, William J.

Throughout his life, Owens attributed the success of his athletic career to the encouragement of Charles Riley, his [[Middle school|junior high school]] track coach at Fairmount Junior High School. Since Owens worked in a shoe repair shop after school, Riley allowed him to practice before school instead.\n\nOwens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) met at Fairmont Junior High School in Cleveland when he was 15 and she was 13. They dated steadily through high school. Ruth gave birth to their first daughter, Gloria, in 1932.

Izabela Czartoryska's son [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] evacuated surviving collections to [[Paris]], [[France]], where he housed them at the [[H\u00f4tel Lambert]]. His son [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Czartoryski]] later reopened the museum in 1878 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], in [[Partitions of Poland|Austrian]] Poland, as the [[Czartoryski Museum]].\n\n==Prus==\nIn 1884, the Temple of the Sibyl was used by the Polish writer [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] as the setting for his [[flash fiction|micro-story]], \"[[Mold of the Earth]].\"\n\nThe story's action takes place adjacent to the Temple, where there is a boulder overgrown with [[mold]]s.  At a certain moment the boulder magically transforms into a [[globe]].\n\nIn his one-and-a-half-page [[microfiction|micro-story]], Prus identifies human [[society|societies]] with [[mold]]s that, over the ages, blindly and impassively contest the surface of the [[globe]].  He thus provides a [[metaphor]] for the competitive struggle for existence that goes on among human communities.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Two [[Microfiction|Micro-Stories]] by [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]],\" ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, p. 99.</ref>\n\nIn 1869, then-22-year-old [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] had briefly studied at the Agricultural and Forestry Institute that had been established on the old Czartoryski estate at Pu\u0142awy.<ref>Edward Pie\u015bcikowski, ''Boles\u0142aw Prus'', p. 147.</ref>  Earlier, he had spent several years of his early childhood in [[Pu\u0142awy]].\n\n==See also==\n*\"[[Mold of the Earth]]\"\n*[[Pythia]]\n*[[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli]]\n*[[Tiburtine Sibyl]]\n*[[Royal Baths Park#Temple of Diana|Royal Baths Park]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Two [[Microfiction|Micro-Stories]] by [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]],\" ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, pp.&nbsp;99\u2013103.\n* Edward Pie\u015bcikowski, ''Boles\u0142aw Prus'', 2nd ed., Warsaw, [[Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe]], 1985, {{ISBN|83-01-05593-6}}.\n* [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Tw\u00f3rczo\u015b\u0107 Boles\u0142awa Prusa'' (The Art of [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]]), 2nd ed., Warsaw, Pa\u0144stwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1972.\n\n{{coord|51|24|54|N|21|57|19|E|source:kolossus-plwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Museums in Lublin Voivodeship]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pu\u0142awy]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus); link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_the_Sibyl"}

BCSS are built upon persuasive systems design techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oinas-Kukkonen |first1=Harri |title=Behavior Change Support Systems: A Research Model and Agenda |journal=Persuasive Technology |volume=6137 |date=2010 |pages=4\u201314 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_3 |bibcode=2010LNCS.6137....4O |isbn=978-3-642-13225-4 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |language=en|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fogg |first1=B.

This theory outlines the relationship between attitudes, intention, and the desired behavior and is one of the most influential determinant models. \nAnother strong influence can be found in the [https://www.behaviormodel.org/ Fogg Behaviour Model] (FBM), which states that any user first needs to be motivated, then to have the ability to perform the change in behavior, and finally to be triggered by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Fogg |first1=B.J. |title=Persuasive technology: using computers to change what we think and do |date=2003 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=9780080479941}}</ref> (The term \u2018trigger\u2019 was changed by the author in late 2017 and the term \u2018prompt\u2019 is now being used). BCSS makes use of extrinsic (perceptual) prompts like alarms, messages with offers or calls to action, ads, requests, and more. \nOther theories that aid in the design and mechanisms behind a BCSS include the [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theory]] (SLT), which studies the interactions between a person (user) and the environment<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bandura |first1=Albert |title=Social Learning Theory |date=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}</ref>, and the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref> (initiated as [[Theory of reasoned action|Theory of Reasoned Action]]).\n\n== Techniques and elements ==\nApplications of BCSS may include game and training elements in several market domains, ranging from Health and Education to Quality of Life (QoL), to professional development and workability. Virtually any concept designed to cause a shift in a person's behavior can be considered a BCSS, even if this change is not directly observed by the users. When users are aware of this intention and choose to work within the system, the chances of favorable results from this system increases. This effect is attributed to [[Metacognition]], as most BCSS systems implement metacognitive strategies for goal attainment<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Anthony M. |title=The Impact of Life Coaching on Goal Attainment, Metacognition and Mental Health |journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal |date=1 January 2003 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=253\u2013263 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2003.31.3.253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halttu |first1=Kirsi |last2=Oinas-Kukkonen |first2=Harri |title=Persuading to Reflect: Role of Reflection and Insight in Persuasive Systems Design for Physical Health |journal=Human\u2013Computer Interaction |date=27 January 2017 |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=381\u2013412 |doi=10.1080/07370024.2017.1283227}}</ref>. Those strategies help users understand the cause of their resistance to adopting the desired behavior. This requires that they monitor themselves daily (or whenever the targeted behavior can be observed) to understand their progress towards the desired behavior, and finally to have recorded evidence (usually objective but also subjective measurements) of their behavioral changes. \n\nBy considering observed behaviors and the distance to the desired behavior, there can be a positive impact on people who have difficulties in changing their behavior. This can be achieved by helping them to develop a personalized plan for reaching targeted behavior and learning the ways to achieve their personal goals. In most cases, the general objective can be split into more than one objective or step, before the aimed at behavior is adopted by the users and eventually becomes a routine. This introduces '''self-management''' in BCSS applications since it is particularly helpful for people to take responsibility for their own actions and do things as well as they can.\nBCSS is very often equipped with additional features like '''game elements''' to foster user engagement leading to [[Serious Games]] applications. Moreover, they implement [[Machine Learning]] techniques to predict the future behavior of users based on their past performance. The evidence of the achieved change in behavior, as well as important notifications during self-evaluation, are communicated with [[Visual Analytics]] tools, such as performance graphs. \nAdditional tools frequently found on BCSS include checklists and questionnaires to collect users' feedback, hardware sensing components like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices (e.g. cameras) and social collaboration to help the members of a user community to support each other. Occasionally, some BCSS allow professionals (trainers, educators, medical personnel and social professionals) to participate in the BCSS activities. This can be done by giving advice and support and also by making decisions and alterations to the treatment plan according to the observed performance and the personal needs of the targeted users.\n\n== Taxonomies ==\nMost BCSSs work on a single profile (targeted user), while only a few can monitor and report progress made by a group of people. There are BCSS applications purely made using software, while others include hardware components like sensors and IoT devices to introduce physical computing in a hybrid physical-digital approach<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraternali |first1=P. |last2=Baroffio |first2=G. |last3=Pasini |first3=C. |last4=Galli |first4=L. |last5=Micheel |first5=I. |last6=Novak |first6=J. |last7=Rizzoli |first7=A. |title=Integrating Real and Digital Games with Data Analytics for Water Consumption Behavioral Change: A Demo |journal=2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) |date=December 2015 |pages=408\u2013409 |doi=10.1109/UCC.2015.68 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7431443|doi-broken-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref>.\nThe devices used to access a BCSS is usually an internet-connected mobile device like a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch. The success in this category of BCSS applications lies in the fact that the sensing and notifications systems of the BCSS can work all day, following the users in daily activities. On the other hand, there are BCSSs which are less intrusive and rely on less frequent access to the system.\nAnother way to distinguish BCSSs is according to the knowledge domain they refer to. Theoretically, BCSS can be built in any knowledge domain.\n\n== Knowledge domains ==\n=== eHealth/mHealth ===\nA few examples of BCSS applied in eHealth domains include CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paliokas |first1=I. |last2=Tzallas |first2=A. |last3=Katertsidis |first3=N. |last4=Votis |first4=K. |last5=Tzovaras |first5=D. |title=Gamification in Social Networking: A Platform for People Living with Dementia and their Caregivers |journal=2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE) |date=October 2017 |pages=574\u2013579 |doi=10.1109/BIBE.2017.00015 |isbn=978-1-5386-1324-5 }}</ref> which is a community-based intervention to support People Living with Dementia (PLwD) and their Caregivers using game elements to engage users in non-pharmacological interventions, iLift<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kuipers |first1=Derek A. |last2=Wartena |first2=Bard O. |last3=Dijkstra |first3=Boudewijn H. |last4=Terlouw |first4=Gijs |last5=van t Veer |first5=Job T.B. |last6=van Dijk |first6=Hylke W. |last7=Prins |first7=Jelle T. |last8=Pierie |first8=Jean Pierre E.N. |title=iLift: A health behavior change support system for lifting and transfer techniques to prevent lower-back injuries in healthcare |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |date=December 2016 |volume=96 |pages=11\u201323 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.12.006|pmid=26797571 }}</ref> which train nursing in lifting and transfer techniques to prevent lower-back injuries, and We4Fit<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pereira |first1=C.

BCSSs are used in education less for imparting knowledge and testing knowledge gained, and more for teaching a difficult subject like \"responsible sexual behaviour\" in middle-school students<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>, or for changing attitudes and beliefs about a topic of interest.\n\nAdopting new behavioral patterns is hard and people see no reason to change their behavior if they do not recognize the blocking issue. The same is true for students of all ages, and for this reason, gamification is used - rewards, competition and motivational cues of a BCSS help students to start thinking about rejecting their current behavior or attitude and to take a step towards their targeted behavior. Prochaska et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite book |title=Changing for good: the revolutionary program that explains the six stages of change and teaches you how to free yourself from bad habits |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0380725724 |edition=1st}}</ref> proposed a six-stages behavioral change model (Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance, and Termination) which fits very well in educational uses of a BCSS, as it appears an ideal environment for making the first step (Contemplation) after a long period of resistance (Pre-contemplation). BCSSs affect the physical world and help people to experiment with an alternative behavioral pattern without thinking of possible coincidences (like social exposure for example). Moreover, the virtual activities performed in a BCSS will help on the next step (Preparation) in which they make a transition from a passive to an active state in a safe environment. The user-monitoring and reward system of a BCSS will help users to complete the rest of the stages of the behavior change (Action, Maintenance, and Termination) and avoid regression to the previous unwanted behavior. Schmied (2017) proposes a similar 7 step process, the Designing for Behaviour Change (DBC) Framework<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schmied |first1=Petr |title=Behaviour change toolkit : for international development practitioners : enabling people to practice positive behaviours |date=2017 |isbn=978-80-87456-83-5 |pages=60 |url=https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/media/publications/752/file/1498144203-behaviour-change-toolkit-mail.pdf}}</ref>. \nOverall, a positive behavioral change in education settings is facilitated by technology through digital intervention strategies, in which a teacher or educator makes adjustments to personalize the interventions to student's profiles and performance<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>.

Some researchers refer to [[Persuasive technology]] to identify the computer-mediated communication between humans or human-computer interaction technologies used to deliver persuasive evidence.

This theory outlines the relationship between attitudes, intention, and the desired behavior and is one of the most influential determinant models. \nAnother strong influence can be found in the [https://www.behaviormodel.org/ Fogg Behaviour Model] (FBM), which states that any user first needs to be motivated, then to have the ability to perform the change in behavior, and finally to be triggered by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Fogg |first1=B.J. |title=Persuasive technology: using computers to change what we think and do |date=2003 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=9780080479941}}</ref> (The term \u2018trigger\u2019 was changed by the author in late 2017 and the term \u2018prompt\u2019 is now being used). BCSS makes use of extrinsic (perceptual) prompts like alarms, messages with offers or calls to action, ads, requests, and more. \nOther theories which aid in the design and mechanisms behind a BCSS include the [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theory]] (SLT) which studies the interactions between a person (user) and the environment<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bandura |first1=Albert |title=Social Learning Theory |date=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}</ref> and the Theory of Planned Behaviour<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ajzen |first1=Icek |title=The theory of planned behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |date=December 1991 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013211 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}</ref> (initiated as [[Theory of reasoned action|Theory of Reasoned Action]]).\n\n== Techniques and elements ==\nApplications of BCSS may include game and training elements in several market domains, ranging from Health and Education to Quality of Life (QoL), to professional development and workability. Virtually any concept designed to cause a shift in a person's behavior can be considered a BCSS, even if this change is not directly observed by the users. When users are aware of this intention and choose to work within the system, the chances of favorable results from this system increases. This effect is attributed to [[Metacognition]], as most BCSS systems implement metacognitive strategies for goal attainment<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Anthony M. |title=The Impact of Life Coaching on Goal Attainment, Metacognition and Mental Health |journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal |date=1 January 2003 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=253\u2013263 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2003.31.3.253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halttu |first1=Kirsi |last2=Oinas-Kukkonen |first2=Harri |title=Persuading to Reflect: Role of Reflection and Insight in Persuasive Systems Design for Physical Health |journal=Human\u2013Computer Interaction |date=27 January 2017 |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=381\u2013412 |doi=10.1080/07370024.2017.1283227}}</ref>. Those strategies help users understand the cause of their resistance to adopting the desired behavior. This requires that they monitor themselves daily (or whenever the targeted behavior can be observed) to understand their progress towards the desired behavior, and finally to have recorded evidence (usually objective but also subjective measurements) of their behavioral changes. \n\nBy considering observed behaviors and the distance to the desired behavior, there can be a positive impact on people who have difficulties in changing their behavior. This can be achieved by helping them to develop a personalized plan for reaching targeted behavior and learning the ways to achieve their personal goals. In most cases, the general objective can be split into more than one objective or step, before the aimed at behavior is adopted by the users and eventually becomes a routine. This introduces '''self-management''' in BCSS applications since it is particularly helpful for people to take responsibility for their own actions and do things as well as they can.\nBCSS is very often equipped with additional features like '''game elements''' to foster user engagement leading to [[Serious Games]] applications. Moreover, they implement [[Machine Learning]] techniques to predict the future behavior of users based on their past performance. The evidence of the achieved change in behavior, as well as important notifications during self-evaluation, are communicated with [[Visual Analytics]] tools, such as performance graphs. \nAdditional tools frequently found on BCSS include checklists and questionnaires to collect users' feedback, hardware sensing components like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices (e.g. cameras) and social collaboration to help the members of a user community to support each other. Occasionally, some BCSS allow professionals (trainers, educators, medical personnel and social professionals) to participate in the BCSS activities. This can be done by giving advice and support and also by making decisions and alterations to the treatment plan according to the observed performance and the personal needs of the targeted users.\n\n== Taxonomies ==\nMost BCSSs work on a single profile (targeted user), while only a few can monitor and report progress made by a group of people. There are BCSS applications purely made using software, while others include hardware components like sensors and IoT devices to introduce physical computing in a hybrid physical-digital approach<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraternali |first1=P. |last2=Baroffio |first2=G. |last3=Pasini |first3=C. |last4=Galli |first4=L. |last5=Micheel |first5=I. |last6=Novak |first6=J. |last7=Rizzoli |first7=A. |title=Integrating Real and Digital Games with Data Analytics for Water Consumption Behavioral Change: A Demo |journal=2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) |date=December 2015 |pages=408\u2013409 |doi=10.1109/UCC.2015.68 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7431443|doi-broken-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref>.\nThe devices used to access a BCSS is usually an internet-connected mobile device like a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch. The success in this category of BCSS applications lies in the fact that the sensing and notifications systems of the BCSS can work all day, following the users in daily activities. On the other hand, there are BCSSs which are less intrusive and rely on less frequent access to the system.\nAnother way to distinguish BCSSs is according to the knowledge domain they refer to. Theoretically, BCSS can be built in any knowledge domain.\n\n== Knowledge domains ==\n=== eHealth/mHealth ===\nA few examples of BCSS applied in eHealth domains include CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paliokas |first1=I. |last2=Tzallas |first2=A. |last3=Katertsidis |first3=N. |last4=Votis |first4=K. |last5=Tzovaras |first5=D. |title=Gamification in Social Networking: A Platform for People Living with Dementia and their Caregivers |journal=2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE) |date=October 2017 |pages=574\u2013579 |doi=10.1109/BIBE.2017.00015 |isbn=978-1-5386-1324-5 }}</ref> which is a community-based intervention to support People Living with Dementia (PLwD) and their Caregivers using game elements to engage users in non-pharmacological interventions, iLift<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kuipers |first1=Derek A. |last2=Wartena |first2=Bard O. |last3=Dijkstra |first3=Boudewijn H. |last4=Terlouw |first4=Gijs |last5=van t Veer |first5=Job T.B. |last6=van Dijk |first6=Hylke W. |last7=Prins |first7=Jelle T. |last8=Pierie |first8=Jean Pierre E.N. |title=iLift: A health behavior change support system for lifting and transfer techniques to prevent lower-back injuries in healthcare |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |date=December 2016 |volume=96 |pages=11\u201323 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.12.006|pmid=26797571 }}</ref> which train nursing in lifting and transfer techniques to prevent lower-back injuries, and We4Fit<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pereira |first1=C.

BCSSs are used in education less for imparting knowledge and testing knowledge gained, and more for teaching a difficult subject like \"responsible sexual behaviour\" in middle-school students<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>, or for changing attitudes and beliefs about a topic of interest.\n\nAdopting new behavioral patterns is hard and people see no reason to change their behavior if they do not recognize the blocking issue. The same is true for students of all ages, and for this reason, gamification is used - rewards, competition and motivational cues of a BCSS help students to start thinking about rejecting their current behavior or attitude and to take a step towards their targeted behavior. Prochaska et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite book |title=Changing for good: the revolutionary program that explains the six stages of change and teaches you how to free yourself from bad habits |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0380725724 |edition=1st}}</ref> proposed a six-stages behavioral change model (Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance, and Termination) which fits very well in educational uses of a BCSS, as it appears an ideal environment for making the first step (Contemplation) after a long period of resistance (Pre-contemplation). BCSSs affect the physical world and help people to experiment with an alternative behavioral pattern without thinking of possible coincidences (like social exposure for example). Moreover, the virtual activities performed in a BCSS will help on the next step (Preparation) in which they make a transition from a passive to an active state in a safe environment. The user-monitoring and reward system of a BCSS will help users to complete the rest of the stages of the behavior change (Action, Maintenance, and Termination) and avoid regression to the previous unwanted behavior. Schmied (2017) proposes a similar 7 step process, the Designing for Behaviour Change (DBC) Framework<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schmied |first1=Petr |title=Behaviour change toolkit : for international development practitioners : enabling people to practice positive behaviours |date=2017 |isbn=978-80-87456-83-5 |pages=60 |url=https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/media/publications/752/file/1498144203-behaviour-change-toolkit-mail.pdf}}</ref>. \nOverall, a positive behavioral change in education settings is facilitated by technology through digital intervention strategies, in which a teacher or educator makes adjustments to personalize the interventions to student's profiles and performance<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Emery |first1=M. |title=The theory and practice of behaviour change in the school context |journal=International Journal of Health Education |date=1980 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=116\u2013125 |issn=0020-7306|pmid=7456673 }}</ref>.

Some researchers refer to [[Persuasive technology]] to identify the computer-mediated communication between humans or human-computer interaction technologies used to deliver persuasive evidence.

(Note: The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) establishes tolerances for [[pesticide residue]]s in foods, which are enforced by the FDA.)\n\nFood also meets the definition of adulteration if: \n*(5) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe food additive; \n*(6) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe new animal drug; \n*(7) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe colour additive; \n*(8) it consists, in whole or in part, of \"any filthy, [[putrid]], or [[Decomposition|decomposed]] substance\" or is otherwise unfit for food; \n*or (9) it has been prepared, packed, or held under [[unsanitary]] conditions ([[insect]], [[rodent]], or [[bird]] infestation) whereby it may have become [[Contaminated food|contaminated]] with filth or rendered injurious to health.\n\nFurther, food is considered adulterated if: \n*(10) it has been [[irradiated]] and the irradiation processing was not done in conformity with a regulation permitting irradiation of the food in question (the FDA has approved irradiation of a number of foods, including [[refrigerated]] or [[Freezing|frozen]] [[raw meat|uncooked meat]], fresh or frozen uncooked [[poultry]], and [[seeds]] for sprouting [21 C.F.R. Part 179].); \n*(11) it contains a [[Ingredient|dietary ingredient]] that presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended in labeling (for example, foods or dietary supplements containing [[aristolochic acids]], which have been linked to [[kidney failure]], have been banned.); \n*(12) a valuable constituent has been omitted in whole or in part or replaced with another substance; damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or a substance has been added to increase the product's bulk or weight, reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear of greater value than it is (this is \"economic adulteration\"); \n*or (13) it is offered for [[import]] into the United States and is a food that has previously been refused admission, unless the person reoffering the food establishes that it is in compliance with U.S. law [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342].\n\n==Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act==\nThe [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]] contain similar provisions<ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title21/html/USCODE-2011-title21-chap12-subchapI-sec601.htm</ref> for meat and poultry products. [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 453(g), 601(m).\n\n===Poisonous or deleterious substances===\n\nGenerally, if a food contains a poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health, it is considered to be adulterated. For example, [[apple cider]] contaminated with [[E. coli]] [[O157:H7]] and [[Brie cheese]] contaminated with [[Listeria monocytogenes]] are adulterated. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, if the poisonous substance is inherent or naturally occurring and its quantity in the food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health, the food will not be considered adulterated. Thus, a food that contains a [[natural toxin]] at very low levels that would not ordinarily be harmful (for instance, small amounts of [[amygdalin]] in [[apricot]] [[Seed|kernels]]) is not adulterated.\n\nSecond, if the poisonous or deleterious substance is unavoidable and is within an established tolerance, regulatory limit, or [[action level]], the food will not be deemed to be adulterated. Tolerances and regulatory limits are thresholds above which a food will be considered adulterated. They are binding on FDA, the food industry, and the courts. Action levels are limits at or above which FDA may regard food as adulterated. They are not binding on FDA. FDA has established numerous action levels (for example, one [[part per million]] [[methylmercury]] in [[fish]]), which are set forth in its booklet Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in Human Food and [[Animal Feed]].\n\nIf a food contains a poisonous substance in excess of a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level, mixing it with \"clean\" food to reduce the level of contamination is not allowed. The deliberate mixing of adulterated food with good food renders the finished product adulterated (FDA, Compliance Policy Guide [CPG \u00a7 555.200]).\n\n===Filth and foreign matter of adulteration ===\nFilth and extraneous material include any objectionable substances in foods, such as foreign matter (for example, glass, metal, plastic, wood, stones, sand, cigarette butts), undesirable parts of the raw plant material (such as stems, pits in pitted [[olives]], pieces of shell in canned [[oysters]]), and filth (namely, [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], [[Decomposition|rot]], insect and rodent parts, [[excreta]], decomposition). Under a strict reading of the FD&C Act, any amount of filth in a food would render it adulterated. FDA regulations, however, authorize the agency to issue [[Defect Action Levels]] (DALs) for natural, unavoidable defects that at low levels do not pose a human [[health hazard]] [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.110]. These DALs are advisory only; they do not have the force of law and do not bind FDA. DALs are set forth in FDA's Compliance Policy Guides and are compiled in the FDA and [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) Defect Action Level Handbook.\n\nIn most cases, DALs are food-specific and defect-specific. For example, the DAL for insect fragments in [[peanut butter]] is an average of thirty or more insect fragments per 100&nbsp;grams (g) [CPG \u00a7 570.300]. In the case of hard or sharp foreign objects, the DAL, which is based on the size of the object and the likelihood it will pose a risk of [[choking]] or injury, applies to all foods (see CPG \u00a7 555.425).\n\n===Economic-adulteration===\nA food is adulterated if it omits a valuable constituent or substitutes another substance, in whole or in part, for a valuable constituent (for instance, [[olive oil]] diluted with [[tea tree oil]]); conceals damage or inferiority in any manner (such as fresh [[fruit]] with [[food coloring]] on its surface to conceal defects); or any substance has been added to it or packed with it to increase its bulk or weight, reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear bigger or of greater value than it is (for example, [[scallops]] to which water has been added to make them heavier).\n\n===Microbiological contamination and adulteration of food ===\n\nThe fact that a food is contaminated with [[pathogens]] (harmful [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], or [[protozoa]]) may, or may not, render it adulterated. Generally, for ready-to-eat foods, the presence of pathogens will render the food adulterated. For example, the presence of [[Salmonella]] on fresh fruits or vegetables or in ready-to-eat meat or poultry products (such as [[luncheon meats]]) will render those products adulterated.\n\nFor meat and poultry products, which are regulated by USDA, the rules are more complicated. Ready-to-eat meat and poultry products contaminated with pathogens, such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes, are adulterated. (Note that [[hot dog|hotdogs]] are considered ready-to-eat products.) For raw meat or poultry products, the presence of pathogens will not always render a product adulterated (because raw meat and poultry products are intended to be cooked, and proper cooking should kill pathogens). Raw poultry contaminated with Salmonella is not adulterated. However, USDA's [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) has ruled that raw meat or poultry products contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 are adulterated. This is because normal cooking methods may not reduce E. coli O157:H7 below infectious levels. E. coli O157:H7 is the only pathogen that is considered an adulterant when present in raw meat or poultry products.{{fact|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Enforcement actions==\n\nIf a food is adulterated, FDA and FSIS have a broad array of enforcement tools. These include seizing and [[Condemnation action|condemning]] the product, detaining imported product, [[enjoining]] persons from [[Food manufacturing|manufacturing]] or [[Food distribution|distributing]] the product, or requesting a [[Product recall|recall]] of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the adulterated product. In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of [[infant formula]], neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an adulterated food product. However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.\n\nState regulators generally have similar enforcement tools at their disposal to prevent the manufacture and distribution of adulterated food. In addition, many states have the authority to immediately [[embargo]] adulterated food and to impose civil [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s. Federal agencies often will coordinate with state or local authorities to remove unsafe food from the market as quickly as possible.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n*[[Adulterant]]\n*[[List of foodborne illness outbreaks by death toll]] - includes contamination incidents\n*[[Counterfeit medications]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite book|title=CRS = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7246/|author= Jasper Womach}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adulterated Food}}\n[[Category:Food safety]]\n[[Category:Adulteration]]\n", "text_old": "'''Adulteration''' is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards.

These include seizing and [[Condemnation action|condemning]] the product, detaining imported product, [[enjoining]] persons from [[Food manufacturing|manufacturing]] or [[Food distribution|distributing]] the product, or requesting a [[Product recall|recall]] of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the adulterated product. In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of [[infant formula]], neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an adulterated food product. However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.\n\nState regulators generally have similar enforcement tools at their disposal to prevent the manufacture and distribution of adulterated food. In addition, many states have the authority to immediately [[embargo]] adulterated food and to impose civil [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s. Federal agencies often will coordinate with state or local authorities to remove unsafe food from the market as quickly as possible.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n*[[Adulterant]]\n*[[List of foodborne illness outbreaks by death toll]] - includes contamination incidents\n*[[Counterfeit medications]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite book|title=CRS = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7246/|author= Jasper Womach}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adulterated Food}}\n[[Category:Food safety]]\n[[Category:Adulteration]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adulterated_food"}
