WordQ's main purpose is helping individuals who struggle with writing. WordQ uses [[word prediction]] to suggest words that the user is typing into documents and emails, helping with spelling. It also uses high-quality Acapela text-to-speech voices to read back text that the user has entered, allowing for proofreading and editing. WordQ is sold alongside a companion product, SpeakQ\u00ae, which combines [[speech recognition]] with the features of WordQ to allow users to switch between speaking and typing while writing. The combined program works with [[Windows]]. WordQ also works with [[Mac OS X]].\n\n== Development ==\nWordQ was first developed in the late 1990s by a research team led by Dr. Fraser Shein at the [[Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital]] [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Shein and the hospital established a co-owned company, called Quillsoft Ltd, to commercialize WordQ and support further research at the hospital. WordQ\u2019s development followed previous software products also developed at Holland Bloorview, KeyREP\u00ae and WiVox\u00ae, which were tools to assist students who had physical writing difficulties. WordQ\u2019s application and functionality was expanded to help those who struggled in writing as a result of learning disabilities and put to use in larger context in [[Ontario]] schools.<ref name=\"morrison\">{{cite web|author=Morrison, Eric|title=Fraser Shein, President and CEO, Quillsoft Ltd.|url=http://www.nationaltechcenter.org/index.php/2007/05/29/ipro-17fraser-shein/|accessdate=January 16, 2011|year=2007}}</ref> Its use then widely expanded in schools in Canada and elsewhere around the world after further development, as the team added features and released the SpeakQ add-on. SpeakQ was developed in collaboration with the Education Development Center (Newton, MA) with support from the US Department of Education. Today, WordQ is used by a broad population of students, not just those with learning difficulties, e.g., second-language learners and average students and workers.\n\n== Features ==\nWordQ has a small interface window that appears on top of whatever window is being run and functions with any application where the user types. As an assistive technology, this is called transparent accessibility. As the user types in letters, the software attempts to suggest the word being used, based upon the first letters and words previously written by the user.<ref>{{Cite conference | first1 = T. | last1 = Nantais | first2 = F. | last2 = Shein | first3 = M. | last3 = Johansson | title = Efficacy of the word prediction algorithm in WordQ | booktitle = Proceedings of the RESNA 2001 Annual Conference | pages = 77\u201379 | publisher = RESNA Press |year=2001}}</ref> As they are writing, the user may use the directional keys or the number keys to select the desired word. The user may also have the program read their typed speech aloud to them as they write, allowing for spelling and grammar changes to be caught while writing. The program can be turned on and off by the user as they write, and it works with all commonly used programs. WordQ currently can be used in English, French, Spanish & German.\n\n== SpeakQ ==\nA companion program, SpeakQ, adds speech recognition capability to WordQ. SpeakQ uses [[Windows Speech Recognition]] to allow the user to dictate into a microphone and have the text appear in the word processor. The user can switch between typing and speaking at will, and the program will suggest words that are hard to pronounce or spell. The user may also train the software to recognize more of their voice, although no initial training is necessary. Like WordQ, SpeakQ may be used with additional languages. SpeakQ has several unique functions: a simple training interface where training words are spoken aloud; speech feedback of recognized words; speech-enabled word prediction; and no verbal commands to learn. SpeakQ was specifically designed to make it easier for people who struggle with the mechanics of writing to express their ideas.<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Alphonso | first = Caroline | title = Speak and the computer listens | newspaper = The Globe and Mail | location = Toronto | date = October 24, 2005 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/speak-and-the-computer-listens/article916917/}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nWordQ & SpeakQ is used in many schools throughout the US and Canada.<ref name=\"WordQcust\">{{cite web|author=WordQ|title=Customers|url=http://www.wordq.com/customers_us.html|accessdate=January 16, 2011|year=2009}}</ref> The software has been marketed in Canada for several years, but is only beginning to emerge on the US market.

At the age of 16, she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|1878 yellow fever epidemic]]. She went to work and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later moving with some of her siblings to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], she found better pay as a teacher. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the ''Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'' newspaper. Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family, while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]]. She was active in [[women's rights]] and the women's suffrage movement, establishing several notable women's organizations.

Wells resisted this solution. To keep her younger siblings together as a family, she found work as a teacher in a black elementary school in Holly Springs. Her paternal grandmother, Peggy Wells, along with other friends and relatives, stayed with her siblings and cared for them during the week while Wells was teaching.\n\nBut when Peggy Wells died from a stroke and her sister Eugenia died, Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt Fanny and moved with her two youngest sisters to Memphis in 1883.\n\n==Early career and anti-segregation activism==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#F3F0FD|salign=right|It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed ...

The previous year, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled against the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers. When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for ''The Living Way'', a black church weekly, about her treatment on the train. In Memphis, she hired an African-American attorney to sue the railroad. When her lawyer was paid off by the railroad,<ref name=\"Fridan3\">Fridan, D., & J. Fridan (2000). ''Ida B.

Moss's store did well and competed with a white-owned grocery store across the street, owned by William Barrett.\n\nOn March 2, 1892, a young black boy named Armour Harris was playing a game of marbles with a young white boy named Cornelius Hurst in front of the People's Grocery. The two boys got into an argument and a fight during the game. As the black boy Harris began to win the fight, the father of Cornelius Hurst intervened and began to \"thrash\" Harris. The People's Grocery employees William Stewart and Calvin McDowell saw the fight and rushed outside to defend the young Harris from the adult Hurst as people in the neighborhood gathered in to what quickly became a \"racially charged mob.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Giddings|title=Ida: A Sword Among Lions: Ida B.

The group of white men were met by a barrage of bullets from the People's Grocery, and Shelby County Sheriff Deputy Charley Cole was wounded, as well as civilian Bob Harold. Hundreds of whites were deputized almost immediately to put down what was perceived by the local Memphis newspapers ''Commercial'' and ''Appeal-Avalanche'' as an armed rebellion by black men in Memphis.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Ida: A Sword Among Lions |last= Giddings |year= 2009 |isbn= |location=|page=180|oclc= 865473600}}</ref>\n\nThomas Moss, a postman in addition to being the owner of the People's Grocery, was named as a conspirator along with McDowell and Stewart.

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

She and her supporters in America saw these tours as an opportunity for her to reach larger, white audiences with her anti-lynching campaign, something she had been unable to accomplish in America.

Mayo was a well-known writer and poet who wrote under the name of Edward Garrett. Both women had read of the particularly gruesome lynching of Henry Smith in Texas and wanted to organize a speaking tour to call attention to American lynchings. They asked Frederick Douglass to make the trip, but citing his age and health, he declined.

A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

In the chapter of her ''Crusade For Justice'' autobiography called \"A Divided Duty,\" Wells described the difficulty she had splitting her time between her family and her work.

When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=african+american+history+oxford#v=onepage&q=african%2520american%2520history%2520oxford&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass |last=Seymour Jr. |first= James B. |work=Well-Barnett, Ida |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780195167771 |editor-last=Finkelman |editor-first=Paul |volume=3 |page=333 |language=en}}</ref>  For the new leading voices, [[Booker T.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup> In 1894 she helped found two Chicago clubs in response to a new state law that gave women the right to vote in certain national and state offices and to run for the elective office of Trustee of the University of Illinois.<sup>[47]</sup> While being involved the women\u2019s suffrage movement, Wells endured opposition from many people, including other women. To support the Republican Party nomination of Lucy L. Flower as a University Trustee, Wells helped organize the Republican Women's Club in Illinois. Flower was eventually elected.<sup>[48]</sup> That same year, Wells was part of a group of women who formed the Alpha Suffrage Club to encourage women's participation in Chicago politics. On a national level, Wells sought to organize African-American groups across the United States. In 1896, Wells, working with [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Mary Church Terrell]] and others, helped found the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]]. She also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans. Her view of women's enfranchisement was pragmatic and political.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B. Wells, Introduction |editor=Ella Wagner |display-editors=etal |date=March 14, 2019 |website=Frances Willard House Museum |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was a predominantly white women's organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.

She went to work and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later moving with some of her siblings to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], she found better pay as a teacher. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the ''Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'' newspaper. Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family, while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers. When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for ''The Living Way'', a black church weekly, about her treatment on the train. In Memphis, she hired an African-American attorney to sue the railroad. When her lawyer was paid off by the railroad,<ref name=\"Fridan3\">Fridan, D., & J. Fridan (2000). ''Ida B.

The two boys got into an argument and a fight during the game. As the black boy Harris began to win the fight, the father of Cornelius Hurst intervened and began to \"thrash\" Harris. The People's Grocery employees William Stewart and Calvin McDowell saw the fight and rushed outside to defend the young Harris from the adult Hurst as people in the neighborhood gathered in to what quickly became a \"racially charged mob.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Giddings|title=Ida: A Sword Among Lions: Ida B.

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup> In 1894 she helped found two Chicago clubs in response to a new state law that gave women the right to vote in certain national and state offices and to run for the elective office of Trustee of the University of Illinois.<sup>[47]</sup> While being involved the women\u2019s suffrage movement, Wells endured opposition from many people, including other women. To support the Republican Party nomination of Lucy L. Flower as a University Trustee, Wells helped organize the Republican Women's Club in Illinois. Flower was eventually elected.<sup>[48]</sup> That same year, Wells was part of a group of women who formed the Alpha Suffrage Club to encourage women's participation in Chicago politics. On a national level, Wells sought to organize African-American groups across the United States. In 1896, Wells, working with [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Mary Church Terrell]] and others, helped found the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]]. She also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans. Her view of women's enfranchisement was pragmatic and political.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B. Wells, Introduction |editor=Ella Wagner |display-editors=etal |date=March 14, 2019 |website=Frances Willard House Museum |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was a predominantly white women's organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.

For the context, see [[History of Europe]].\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{see|Agriculture in the Middle Ages}}\nEarly in the first millennium, improvements in technique and technology began to emerge. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]], which existed under different names throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=2013-04-24|author=Jourdan, Pablo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414172021/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|archivedate=2013-04-14}}</ref> There were exchanges with distant regions mediated through the [[Arab world]].

The plough was significantly improved, developing into the [[mouldboard plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard plough]], capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population.<ref name=Backer/> Farmers in Europe moved from a two field [[crop rotation]] to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including [[legumes]], such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved [[horse harness]]es and the [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] also changed methods of cultivation.<ref name=Backer>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|title=Part 1 \u2013 Medieval European history|author=Backer, Patricia|publisher=San Jose State University|accessdate=2013-04-24|work=History of Technology|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304180952/http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|archivedate=2015-03-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Watermill]]s were initially developed by the Romans, but were improved throughout the Middle Ages, along with [[windmill]]s, and were provided the power needed to grind grains into flour, cut wood and process flax and wool, and irrigate fields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Paul B.|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-mss7-OStgC&pg=PA88|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|page=88|isbn=9780786450527}}</ref>\n\nField crops included wheat, rye, barley and oats; they were used for bread and animal fodder.

Soil exhaustion, overpopulation, wars, diseases and climate change caused hundreds of famines in medieval Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=William Chester|title=The Great Famine: Northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6mBDhnM76EC|year=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400822133}}</ref><ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''Times of feast, times of famine: a history of climate since the year 1000'' (1972)</ref>   Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. Famines such as  [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]] slowly weakened the populace.  Few people died of starvation because the weakest had already succumbed to a routine disease they otherwise would have survived.  A plague like the [[Black Death]] killed its victims in one locality in a matter of days or even hours, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\n:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended.  Traditional bonds of kinship, village and even religion were broken and the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. \"People cared no more for dead men that we care for dead goats,\" wrote one survivor.<ref>Mark Kishlansky et al.  ''Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715'' (5th ed. 2003) p. 316</ref>\n\nDepopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. These events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Norman Cantor, ''The civilization of the Middle Ages'' (1993) p. 480.</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nA major technological advance came in long-distance navigation, from the 8th Century to the 12th Century.  [[Viking]] raids and the [[Crusades|Crusader]] invasions of the Middle East led to the diffusion of and refinement of technology instrumental to [[Maritime history|overseas travel]].  People made improvements in ships, particularly the [[longship]].  The [[astrolabe]], for navigation, greatly aided long-distance travel over the seas.  The improvements in travel in turn increased trade and the diffusion of consumer items.\n\n===Crafts and urban growth===\nFrom the 11th Century to the 13th Century, farmers and small-scale producers of [[crafts]] increasingly met in towns to trade their goods.  They met in either seasonal [[trade fair]]s or they traded in an ongoing basis.  Craft associations called [[guild]]s fostered the development of skills and the local growth of trade in particular goods.  Over the course of the centuries of this period towns grew in size and number, first in a core in England, Flanders, France, Germany and northern Italy.\n\nThe economic system of this era was [[merchant capitalism]].  The core of this system was in merchant houses, backed by financiers acting as intermediaries between [[simple commodity production|simple commodity producers]].  This system continued until it was supplanted by industrial capitalism in the 18th Century.\n\nEconomic activity over a broad geographic range began to intensify in both northern and southern Europe in the 13th Century.\n\nTrade flourished in Italy (albeit not united, but rather ruled by different princes in different [[city-state]]s), particularly by the 13th Century.  Leading the trade in Mediterranean Europe were traders from the port cities of [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].  The wealth generated in Italy fueled the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League]]\n\n===Hanseatic League===\nIn cities linked to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] a trade monopoly developed in the [[Hanseatic League]].  This facilitated the growth of trade among cities in close proximity to these two seas.\nLong-distance trade in the Baltic intensified, as the major trading towns came together in the Hanseatic League, under the leadership of [[L\u00fcbeck]].\n\nThe League was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe and flourished from the 1200 to 1500, and continued with lesser importance after that.   The chief cities were [[History of Cologne|Cologne]]  on the Rhine River, [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] on the North Sea, and L\u00fcbeck on the Baltic.<ref>James Westfall  Thompson,''Economic and Social History of Europe in the Later Middle Ages (1300\u20131530)'' (1931) pp. 146\u201379</ref>\n\nThe Hanseatic cities each had its own legal system and a degree of political autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Clive Day|title=A History of Commerce|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorycommerc07daygoog|year=1914|pages=252ff}}</ref>\nThe [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of North German and Baltic cities during the Middle Ages. The Hanseatic League was founded for the purpose of joining forces for promoting mercantile interests, defensive strength and political influence.  By the 14th century, the Hanseatic League held a near-monopoly on trade in the Baltic, especially with [[Novgorod]] and [[Scandinavia]].<ref>Cornelius Walford, \"An Outline History of the Hanseatic League, More Particularly in Its Bearings upon English Commerce,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society,'' Vol. 9, (1881), pp. 82\u2013136 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3677937 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] unlinked the French economy from Europe.  Town life and trade declined and society became based on the self-sufficient manor.  Some international trade existed for luxury goods such as silk, papyrus, and silver; it was handled by foreign merchants such as the [[Radanites]].\n\nAgricultural output began to increase in the [[Carolingian]] age as a result of the arrival of new crops, improvements in agricultural production, and good weather conditions. However, this did not lead to the revival of urban life; in fact, urban activity further declined in the Carolingian era as a result of civil war, Arab raids, and [[Viking]] invasions. (See also [[Pirenne thesis]]). The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a continuation of the agricultural boom of the Carolingian age. In addition, urban life grew during this period; [[History of Paris|Paris]] expanded dramatically.\n\nThe 13 decades from 1335 to 1450 spawned a series of economic catastrophes, with bad harvests, famines, plagues and wars that overwhelmed four generations of Frenchmen.  The population had expanded, making the food supply more precarious.  The Black Death of 1347 was echoed by several smaller plagues at 15 year intervals.  The French and English armies during the [[Hundred Years War]] marched back and forth across the land; they did not massacre civilians, but they drained the food supply, disrupted agriculture and trade, and left disease and famine in their wake.  Royal authority weakened, as local nobles became strongmen fighting their neighbors for control of the local region.  France's population plunged from 17 million, down to 12 million in 130 years. Finally, starting in the 1450s, a long cycle of recuperation began.<ref>Roger Price, ''A Concise History of France'' (1993) pp. 41\u201346</ref>\n\n==Early modern Europe: 1500\u20131800==\n\nThe [[age of discovery]], seen from the European point of view, introduced major economic changes. The [[Columbian exchange]] resulted in Europe adopting new crops, as well as shaking up traditional cultural ideas and practices. The [[commercial revolution]] continued, with Europeans developing [[mercantilism]] and European imports of [[luxury goods]] (notably spices and fine cloth<ref>\n[[Calico]] (from Calicut), [[muslin]] and [[chintz]], for example.\n</ref>) from eastern and southern Asia switching from crossing Islamic territory in the present-day [[Middle East]] to passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Spain proved adept at [[Spanish colonization of the Americas | plundering the gold and silver of the Americas]], but incompetent at converting its new wealth into a vibrant [[Economic history of Spain | domestic economy]], and declined as an economic [[great power | power]]. From the 1600s, the centres of commerce and manufactures shifted definitively from the Mediterranean to the centres of shipping and colonisation on the western Atlantic coastal fringe: economic activity went into a relative decline in 17th century [[Economic history of Italy|Italy]] and [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] - but to the advantage of [[Economic history of Portugal | Portugal]], [[Economic history of Spain | Spain]], [[Economic history of France | France]], the [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815) | Dutch Republic]] and [[Economic history of the United Kingdom | England/Britain]]. In eastern Europe, [[Russia]] suppressed the [[Tatar slave raids in East Slavic lands | Tatar slave-trade]], expanded [[fur trade | commerce in luxury furs]] from Siberia and rivalled the Scandinavian and German states in the Baltic.

After 1500, New World crops appeared such as beans, corn (maize), squash, tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers.  Production techniques remained attached to medieval traditions and produced low yields. With the rapidly expanding population, additional land suitable for farming became scarce. The situation worsened with repeated disastrous harvests in the 1550s.<ref>William Doyle, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of the Ancien R\u00e9gime'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the high-temperature [[forge]] in northeast France led to mineral mining, although France had to import copper, bronze, tin, and lead.  Mines and glasswork benefited greatly from royal tax exemptions for a period of about twenty years.  Silk production (introduced in [[Tours]] in 1470 and in [[Lyon]] in 1536) enabled the French to join a thriving market, but French products remained of lesser quality than Italian silks.  Wool production was widespread, as was the production of [[linen]] and of [[hemp]] (both major export products).\n\n[[Lyon]] served as the center of France's banking and international trade markets.  Market fairs occurred four times a year and facilitated the export of French goods (such as fabrics), and the import of Italian, German, Dutch, English goods. It also allowed the importation of exotic goods such as silks, [[alum]], glass, [[wool]]s, [[spices]], dyes.  Lyon also contained houses of most of Europe's banking families, including the [[Fugger]]s and the [[Medici]].  Regional markets and [[trade route]]s linked Lyon, Paris and Rouen to the rest of the country.  Under King [[Francis I of France | Francis I]] (reigned 1515-1547) and King [[Henry II of France | Henry II]] (reigned 1547-1559), the relationships between French imports and exports to England and to Spain were in France's favor. Trade was roughly balanced with the Netherlands, but France continually ran a large [[trade deficit]] with Italy due to the latter's silks and exotic goods.  In subsequent decades, English, Dutch and Flemish maritime activity would create competition with French trade, which would eventually displace the major markets to the northwest,{{where?|date=January 2019}} leading to the decline of Lyon.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, France's demographic growth, its increased demand for consumer goods, and its rapid influx of gold and silver from Africa and the Americas led to inflation (grain became five times as expensive from 1520 to 1600), and wage stagnation.  Although many land-owning peasants and enterprising merchants had been able to grow rich during the boom, the standard of living fell greatly for rural peasants, who were forced to deal with bad harvests at the same time.  This led to reduced [[purchasing power]] and a decline in manufacturing.  The monetary crisis led France to abandon (in 1577) the ''livre'' as its money of account, in favor of the [[\u00c9cu (coin) |\u00e9cu]] in circulation, and banning most foreign currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, France's military ventures in Italy and disastrous civil wars demanded huge sums of cash, which were raised with through the ''[[taille]]'' and other taxes. The taille, which was levied mainly on the peasantry, increased from 2.5 million livres in 1515 to 6 million after 1551, and by 1589 the taille had reached a record 21 million livres. Financial crises hit the royal household repeatedly, and so in 1523, Francis I established a government bond system in Paris, the \"rentes sur l'H\u00f4tel de Ville\".\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Main|Economic history of the United Kingdom|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|300px|Mercantilism helped create trade patterns such as the [[triangular trade]] in the North Atlantic, in which raw materials were imported to the metropolis and then processed and redistributed to other colonies.]]\n\n====Mercantilism and empire====\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade inside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The modern or \"second\" British Empire was based upon the [[English colonial empire|English Empire]] which first took shape in the early 18th century, with the English settlement of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as Canada's [[Maritime provinces]], and the control of sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, notably Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the [[Leeward Islands]], Barbados, Jamaica and Bermuda. These islands, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised Britain's most lucrative colonies in terms of profits flowing to the absentee owners (who lived in Britain). The American colonies also utilized slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo and rice in the south. Britain's American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Britain control over what is now most of Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|pages=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|pages=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |first= William R. |last= Nester\n |title= The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755\n |location= |publisher= Praeger |year = 2000\n |page=54 |isbn=978-0-275-96772-7\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Industrial Revolution: 1750s\u20131840s==\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] brought factories to Europe, especially England and Scotland, 1750s to 1830s.  France and the U.S. experienced its industrial revolution in the early 19th century; Germany in the 19th century; and to Russia in the early-mid 20th century.\n\nIn Britain, the Industrial Revolution was a period of economic transformation from the  1750s to the 1830s, characterized by the growth of a new system comprising factories, railroads, coal mining and business enterprises using new technologies that it sponsored.  The new system operated first on textiles, then spread to other sectors and by the mid 19th century totally transformed the British economy and society, setting up sustained growth; it spread to parts of America and Europe and modernized the world economy.  Although localized to certain parts of Britain (the London area was not included), its impact was felt worldwide on migration and trade, society and politics, on cities and countryside, and affected the remotest areas.  The growth rate in the British GDP was 1.5% per year (1770\u20131815), doubling to 3.0% (1815\u20131831).<ref>C.H. Feinstein, \"National Statistics, 1760\u20131920\", in C.H. Feinstein and S.

Entrepreneurs found uses for stationary engines in turning the machines in a factory or the pumps at a mine, while mobile engines were put into locomotives and ships (where they turned paddles or, later, propellers). The use of water power was growing too, so that in 1830 steam mills and water mills were about equal (at 165,000 horsepower each); by 1879 Britain obtained 2.1 million  horsepower from steam engines, and 230,000 from water.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Nicholas |last=Crafts |title=Steam as a General Purpose Technology: a Growth Accounting Perspective |journal=Economic Journal |year=2004 |volume=114 |issue=495 |pages=338\u201351 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2003.00200.x  |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22354/1/wp75.pdf }} Crafts also estimates that all technological innovations, including steam engines, accounted for about 18% of British economic growth from 1780 to 1830, and 31% from 1830 to 1870.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n{{Further|Industrial Revolution#Belgium}}\nNo one expected that Belgium-seemingly a \"sluggish\" and \"culturally dormant\" bastion of traditionalism-would leap\u2013 to the forefront of the industrial revolution on the Continent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Schama |title=The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330 |journal=History of Education |year=1972 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201389 |doi=10.1080/0046760720010106 }}</ref>  Nevertheless, Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the industrial revolution took place and it set the pace for all of continental Europe, while leaving the Netherlands behind.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Mokyr |title=The Industrial Revolution in the Low Countries in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century: A Comparative Case Study |journal=Journal of Economic History |year=1974 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=365\u201399 |jstor=2116987 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700080116 }}</ref>\n\nIndustrialization took place in [[Wallonia]] (French-speaking southern Belgium), starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after 1830. The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories  integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Evans |first2=G\u00f6ran |last2=Ryd\u00e9n |title=The Industrial Revolution in Iron; The impact of British Coal Technology in Nineteenth-Century Europe |location= |publisher=Ashgate |year=2005 |pages=37\u201338 |isbn=978-0-7546-3390-7 }}</ref>  By 1830, when iron became important the Belgium coal industry had long been established, and used steam-engines for pumping. Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia.  The textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. [[Ghent]] was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to [[Li\u00e8ge]], with its steel industry.<ref>{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Strikwerda |title=A House Divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish Nationalists in Nineteenth-Century Belgium |location= |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=1997 |pages=44\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8476-8526-4 }}</ref>\n\nCheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The ''[[Sillon industriel]]'' (''Industrial Valley''), and in particular the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' around [[Charleroi]], were the center of the steel industry until the 1940s.\n\n===Railways===\n{{see|History of rail transport}}\nThe growth of industry soon brought to light the need for a better system of transportation. While canals and roads did improve, they were soon overshadowed by a means of transportation that held great promise: the railroads. The railroads may have been that most important factor of the industrial revolution. Railways had existed as early as 1500, but in 1700s the primitive wooden rails were replaced with wrought iron. These new rails enabled horses to pull even heavier loads with relative ease. But dependence on horsepower did not last for long. In 1804, the first steam-powered locomotive pulled 10 tons of ore and 70 people at 5 miles per hour. This new technology improved dramatically; locomotives soon reached speeds of 50 miles per hour. While the railroads revolutionized transportation, they further contributed to the growth of the industrial revolution by causing a great increase in the demand for iron and coal.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=O\u2019Brien |title=Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830\u20131914 |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-333-33000-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Iron and steel===\nThroughout the Middle Ages iron was smelted using charcoal, however in the eighteenth century, new methods of iron production were discovered; the resulting iron was of higher quality than ever before. These advances, such as the process developed by Henry Cort in the 1780s, greatly encouraged the use of machinery in other industries.\n\nIron was so durable that it became the preferred metal for tools and equipment until displaced by steel after 1860.<ref>Small amounts of steel were produced before the 1860s, but it was five times stronger than cast iron.</ref>  Britain had iron ores but lacked a process to produce iron in quantity until in 1760 John Smeaton invented a blast furnace that could smelt iron both quickly and cheaply.  His invention used an air-blast produced by a fan run by a waterwheel. In 1783, Henry Cort introduced the puddling, or reverberatory furnace, in which the final product was a pasty solid instead of a liquid. It was rolled into balls, squeezed and rolled to eliminate the impurities, or slag.  The result was malleable iron in large quantities.  The greatest of the early ironmasters, John Wilkinson (1728\u20131808) invented new machinery to process the iron. In 1779, the first cast-iron bridge was constructed across the Severn; in 1790 the first iron ship was launched. By 1830, Britain was producing 700,000 tons of iron a year; the amount quadrupled a quarter-century later, with centers in Scotland, South Wales, and Staffordshire. Railway builders were the chief customer. In 1847\u201348 they bought 3 million tons for rolling stock, bridge building, and station building for 2000 new miles, plus the demands of the 3000 previously built miles of railway.<ref>John Clapham, ''An Economic History of Modern Britain'' (1952)  1:425\u201328</ref>\n\n==Germany between the wars==\nAfter the war, Germany was supposed to pay all of the war [[war reparations|reparations]] according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The policy angered the Germans and caused deep resentment, especially of the sort that the Nazis capitalized upon.  However the sums actually paid were not large, and were financed by loans from New York in the [[Dawes Plan]]. Payments ended in 1931, but in the 1950s West Germany did pay all the reparations.  There was an overwhelming inflation in 1923 caused by the government's pumping out paper money. The reconstruction period was based on private investment and demand. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the investors who had been financing Germany pulled out, crippling its economy as unemployment soared to 25%.<ref>Kruedener, Jurgen Baron von.

[[World War II]] was a [[total war]] that was ultimately decided in the factories and workplaces of the  [[Allies of World War II]], which had a much better performance than the [[Axis powers]]. Indeed, Germany and Japan depended as much or more on plunder of conquered territories than they did on their own production. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree. The success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences on the [[Home front during World War I]] and tried to use its lessons and avoid its possible sources of error. The home front engaged in several activities to help the British army and navy, including taking down metal fences and gates to replace them with stone or wood. The metal was then melted down, and used for battle ships or planes.<ref>I.C.B. Dear, and M.R.D. Foot, eds.

It played a major role in the economic recovery, modernization, and unification of Europe. In three years the ERP gave away $12.4 billion (about 5% of the 1948 American GDP of $270 billion) for modernizing the economic and financial systems and rebuilding the industrial and human capital of war-torn Europe, including Britain, Germany, France, Italy and smaller nations.  It required each government to set up a national economic plan, and for the countries to cooperate in terms of financial and trade flows. The money was not a loan and there was no repayment. Washington spent such vast sums because it was believed to be cheaper than the rearmament that isolationism or rollback would entail. In the long run, the logic went, a prosperous Europe would be more peaceful, and would make its main trading partner, the US, more prosperous. Stalin refused to allow any of his satellites to participate, the plan became exclusive to western Europe. However, the US extended a similar financial aid program to Japan at the same time.<ref>Martin Schain, ed., ''The Marshall Plan: Fifty Years After'' (2001).</ref>\n\nHistorians reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs, chiefly from the United States.  Bradford De Long and Barry Eichengreen conclude it was, \" History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\">{{cite book |first=J.

The powerful combination of ERP and [[NATO]] (1949) gave Europe the assurance of America's commitment to the security and prosperity of Western Europe, and helped the recipients avoid the pessimism and despair that characterized the aftermath of World War I. The Marshall Plan thus created in Europe an unstoppable \"revolution of rising expectations,\" the striking phrase coined in 1950 by Harlan Cleveland, an economist and senior ERP official.<ref>Michael J.

They formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951.   The idea was to stream-line coal and steel production.  A side-benefit would be economic interdependence.  Thereby, there would be less risk of Economic warfare or even a shooting war between the member nations.<ref>Louis Lister, ''Europe's Coal and Steel Community: an experiment in economic union'' (1960).</ref>\n\n===Industrial decline===\nThe decades from the 1960s saw an economic decline in the output of the more developed nations of Europe, particularly in France and the UK.  These nations' positions in output of refined raw materials, e.g. steel, and in finished goods fell in contrast to Asian countries. \nSeveral Asian nations made use of [[comparative advantage]] and specialized in producing certain goods, utilizing comparably cheaper labor forces.  First this occurred in [[Japan]] and the four \"[[Asian Tigers (economics)|Asian Tigers]]\" ([[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]); by the latter half of the 1980s the shift of industrial production began occurring in the [[newly industrializing countries]]. \nFirst, the shift occurred in cheaper, lower technology products, such as [[textiles]].  Then, this shift occurred in higher-technology goods, such \"durables\" as [[refrigerator]]s or [[automobile]]s.  The shift of international industrial production out of Europe is a key outcome of [[globalization]].\n\n==The Euro==\n\n===Introduction of the Euro===\n\nThe [[Euro]] became the official currency of certain [[European Union]] members on January 1, 2001.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/euro/Intro.html]</ref> The currency was signed into effect in 1992 in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]].

These nations agreed in principle to the [[European Monetary Union]] (EMU) in 1999 and installed the Euro as its currency on January 1, 2001.

Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]], which existed under different names throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=2013-04-24|author=Jourdan, Pablo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414172021/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|archivedate=2013-04-14}}</ref> There were exchanges with distant regions mediated through the [[Arab world]].

The plough was significantly improved, developing into the [[mouldboard plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard plough]], capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population.<ref name=Backer/> Farmers in Europe moved from a two field [[crop rotation]] to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including [[legumes]], such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved [[horse harness]]es and the [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] also changed methods of cultivation.<ref name=Backer>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|title=Part 1 \u2013 Medieval European history|author=Backer, Patricia|publisher=San Jose State University|accessdate=2013-04-24|work=History of Technology|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304180952/http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|archivedate=2015-03-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Watermill]]s were initially developed by the Romans, but were improved throughout the Middle Ages, along with [[windmill]]s, and were provided the power needed to grind grains into flour, cut wood and process flax and wool, and irrigate fields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Paul B.|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-mss7-OStgC&pg=PA88|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|page=88|isbn=9780786450527}}</ref>\n\nField crops included wheat, rye, barley and oats; they were used for bread and animal fodder.

Soil exhaustion, overpopulation, wars, diseases and climate change caused hundreds of famines in medieval Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=William Chester|title=The Great Famine: Northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6mBDhnM76EC|year=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400822133}}</ref><ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''Times of feast, times of famine: a history of climate since the year 1000'' (1972)</ref>   Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. Famines such as  [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]] slowly weakened the populace.  Few people died of starvation because the weakest had already succumbed to a routine disease they otherwise would have survived.  A plague like the [[Black Death]] killed its victims in one locality in a matter of days or even hours, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\n:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended.  Traditional bonds of kinship, village and even religion were broken and the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. \"People cared no more for dead men that we care for dead goats,\" wrote one survivor.<ref>Mark Kishlansky et al.  ''Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715'' (5th ed. 2003) p. 316</ref>\n\nDepopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. These events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Norman Cantor, ''The civilization of the Middle Ages'' (1993) p. 480.</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nA major technological advance came in long-distance navigation, from the 8th Century to the 12th Century.  [[Viking]] raids and the [[Crusades|Crusader]] invasions of the Middle East led to the diffusion of and refinement of technology instrumental to [[Maritime history|overseas travel]].  People made improvements in ships, particularly the [[longship]].  The [[astrolabe]], for navigation, greatly aided long-distance travel over the seas.  The improvements in travel in turn increased trade and the diffusion of consumer items.\n\n===Crafts and urban growth===\nFrom the 11th Century to the 13th Century, farmers and small-scale producers of [[crafts]] increasingly met in towns to trade their goods.  They met in either seasonal [[trade fair]]s or they traded in an ongoing basis.  Craft associations called [[guild]]s fostered the development of skills and the local growth of trade in particular goods.  Over the course of the centuries of this period towns grew in size and number, first in a core in England, Flanders, France, Germany and northern Italy.\n\nThe economic system of this era was [[merchant capitalism]].  The core of this system was in merchant houses, backed by financiers acting as intermediaries between [[simple commodity production|simple commodity producers]].  This system continued until it was supplanted by industrial capitalism in the 18th Century.\n\nEconomic activity over a broad geographic range began to intensify in both northern and southern Europe in the 13th Century.\n\nTrade flourished in Italy (albeit not united, but rather ruled by different princes in different [[city-state]]s), particularly by the 13th Century.  Leading the trade in Mediterranean Europe were traders from the port cities of [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].  The wealth generated in Italy fueled the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League]]\n\n===Hanseatic League===\nIn cities linked to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] a trade monopoly developed in the [[Hanseatic League]].  This facilitated the growth of trade among cities in close proximity to these two seas.\nLong-distance trade in the Baltic intensified, as the major trading towns came together in the Hanseatic League, under the leadership of [[L\u00fcbeck]].\n\nThe League was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe and flourished from the 1200 to 1500, and continued with lesser importance after that.   The chief cities were [[History of Cologne|Cologne]]  on the Rhine River, [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] on the North Sea, and L\u00fcbeck on the Baltic.<ref>James Westfall  Thompson,''Economic and Social History of Europe in the Later Middle Ages (1300\u20131530)'' (1931) pp. 146\u201379</ref>\n\nThe Hanseatic cities each had its own legal system and a degree of political autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Clive Day|title=A History of Commerce|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorycommerc07daygoog|year=1914|pages=252ff}}</ref>\nThe [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of North German and Baltic cities during the Middle Ages. The Hanseatic League was founded for the purpose of joining forces for promoting mercantile interests, defensive strength and political influence.  By the 14th century, the Hanseatic League held a near-monopoly on trade in the Baltic, especially with [[Novgorod]] and [[Scandinavia]].<ref>Cornelius Walford, \"An Outline History of the Hanseatic League, More Particularly in Its Bearings upon English Commerce,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society,'' Vol. 9, (1881), pp. 82\u2013136 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3677937 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] unlinked the French economy from Europe.  Town life and trade declined and society became based on the self-sufficient manor.  Some international trade existed for luxury goods such as silk, papyrus, and silver; it was handled by foreign merchants such as the [[Radanites]].\n\nAgricultural output began to increase in the [[Carolingian]] age as a result of the arrival of new crops, improvements in agricultural production, and good weather conditions. However, this did not lead to the revival of urban life; in fact, urban activity further declined in the Carolingian era as a result of civil war, Arab raids, and [[Viking]] invasions. (See also [[Pirenne thesis]]). The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a continuation of the agricultural boom of the Carolingian age. In addition, urban life grew during this period; [[History of Paris|Paris]] expanded dramatically.\n\nThe 13 decades from 1335 to 1450 spawned a series of economic catastrophes, with bad harvests, famines, plagues and wars that overwhelmed four generations of Frenchmen.  The population had expanded, making the food supply more precarious.  The Black Death of 1347 was echoed by several smaller plagues at 15 year intervals.  The French and English armies during the [[Hundred Years War]] marched back and forth across the land; they did not massacre civilians, but they drained the food supply, disrupted agriculture and trade, and left disease and famine in their wake.  Royal authority weakened, as local nobles became strongmen fighting their neighbors for control of the local region.  France's population plunged from 17 million, down to 12 million in 130 years. Finally, starting in the 1450s, a long cycle of recuperation began.<ref>Roger Price, ''A Concise History of France'' (1993) pp. 41\u201346</ref>\n\n==Early modern Europe: 1500\u20131800==\n\nThe [[age of discovery]], seen from the European point of view, introduced major economic changes. The [[Columbian exchange]] resulted in Europe adopting new crops, as well as shaking up traditional cultural ideas and practices. The [[commercial revolution]] continued, with Europeans developing [[mercantilism]] and European imports of [[luxury goods]] (notably spices and fine cloth<ref>\n[[Calico]] (from Calicut), [[muslin]] and [[chintz]], for example.\n</ref>) from eastern and southern Asia switching from crossing Islamic territory in the present-day [[Middle East]] to passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Spain proved adept at [[Spanish colonization of the Americas | plundering the gold and silver of the Americas]], but incompetent at converting its new wealth into a vibrant [[Economic history of Spain | domestic economy]], and declined as an economic [[great power | power]]. From the 1600s, the centres of commerce and manufactures shifted definitively from the Mediterranean to the centres of shipping and colonisation on the western Atlantic coastal fringe: economic activity went into a relative decline in 17th century [[Economic history of Italy|Italy]] and [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] - but to the advantage of [[Economic history of Portugal | Portugal]], [[Economic history of Spain | Spain]], [[Economic history of France | France]], the [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815) | Dutch Republic]] and [[Economic history of the United Kingdom | England/Britain]]. In eastern Europe, [[Russia]] suppressed the [[Tatar slave raids in East Slavic lands | Tatar slave-trade]], expanded [[fur trade | commerce in luxury furs]] from Siberia and rivalled the Scandinavian and German states in the Baltic. [[Colonial goods]] like [[History of sugar | sugar]] and [[History of tobacco | tobacco]] from the Americas came to play a role in the European economy. Meanwhile, [[history of banking | changes in financial practice]] (especially in the Netherlands and in England), the [[second agricultural revolution]] in Britain and technological innovations in France, Prussia and England not only promoted economic changes and expansion in themselves, but also fostered the beginnings of the [[industrial revolution]].\n\n===France===\n{{main|Ancien R\u00e9gime|Early modern France}}\nBefore 1800, France was the most populated country in Europe, with a population of 17 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The 17th and 18th centuries saw a steady increase in urban populations, although France remained a profoundly rural country, with less than 10% of the population located in urban areas.  [[History of Paris|Paris]] was the largest city in Europe, in 1754, with 650,000 people by the end of the 18th century.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Price\n | first1 = Roger\n | year = 1993\n | title = A Concise History of France\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0TaZAgAAQBAJ\n | series = Cambridge Concise Histories\n | edition = 3\n | location = Cambridge\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | publication-date = 2014\n | page = 29\n | isbn = 9781107729124\n | access-date = 28 January 2019\n | quote = Paris [...] by the middle of the seventeenth century had a population of {{circa}} 550.000, and by the end of the following century this had grown to 650,000 [...].\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAgricultural production of a variety of food items expanded: olive oil, wine, cider, [[woad]] (a source of blue dye), and [[saffron]].  After 1500, New World crops appeared such as beans, corn (maize), squash, tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers.  Production techniques remained attached to medieval traditions and produced low yields. With the rapidly expanding population, additional land suitable for farming became scarce. The situation worsened with repeated disastrous harvests in the 1550s.<ref>William Doyle, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of the Ancien R\u00e9gime'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the high-temperature [[forge]] in northeast France led to mineral mining, although France had to import copper, bronze, tin, and lead.  Mines and glasswork benefited greatly from royal tax exemptions for a period of about twenty years.  Silk production (introduced in [[Tours]] in 1470 and in [[Lyon]] in 1536) enabled the French to join a thriving market, but French products remained of lesser quality than Italian silks.  Wool production was widespread, as was the production of [[linen]] and of [[hemp]] (both major export products).\n\n[[Lyon]] served as the center of France's banking and international trade markets.  Market fairs occurred four times a year and facilitated the export of French goods (such as fabrics), and the import of Italian, German, Dutch, English goods. It also allowed the importation of exotic goods such as silks, [[alum]], glass, [[wool]]s, [[spices]], dyes.  Lyon also contained houses of most of Europe's banking families, including the [[Fugger]]s and the [[Medici]].  Regional markets and [[trade route]]s linked Lyon, Paris and Rouen to the rest of the country.  Under King [[Francis I of France | Francis I]] (reigned 1515-1547) and King [[Henry II of France | Henry II]] (reigned 1547-1559), the relationships between French imports and exports to England and to Spain were in France's favor. Trade was roughly balanced with the Netherlands, but France continually ran a large [[trade deficit]] with Italy due to the latter's silks and exotic goods.  In subsequent decades, English, Dutch and Flemish maritime activity would create competition with French trade, which would eventually displace the major markets to the northwest,{{where?|date=January 2019}} leading to the decline of Lyon.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, France's demographic growth, its increased demand for consumer goods, and its rapid influx of gold and silver from Africa and the Americas led to inflation (grain became five times as expensive from 1520 to 1600), and wage stagnation.  Although many land-owning peasants and enterprising merchants had been able to grow rich during the boom, the standard of living fell greatly for rural peasants, who were forced to deal with bad harvests at the same time.  This led to reduced [[purchasing power]] and a decline in manufacturing.  The monetary crisis led France to abandon (in 1577) the ''livre'' as its money of account, in favor of the [[\u00c9cu (coin) |\u00e9cu]] in circulation, and banning most foreign currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, France's military ventures in Italy and disastrous civil wars demanded huge sums of cash, which were raised with through the ''[[taille]]'' and other taxes. The taille, which was levied mainly on the peasantry, increased from 2.5 million livres in 1515 to 6 million after 1551, and by 1589 the taille had reached a record 21 million livres. Financial crises hit the royal household repeatedly, and so in 1523, Francis I established a government bond system in Paris, the \"rentes sur l'H\u00f4tel de Ville\".\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Main|Economic history of the United Kingdom|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|300px|Mercantilism helped create trade patterns such as the [[triangular trade]] in the North Atlantic, in which raw materials were imported to the metropolis and then processed and redistributed to other colonies.]]\n\n====Mercantilism and empire====\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade inside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The modern or \"second\" British Empire was based upon the [[English colonial empire|English Empire]] which first took shape in the early 18th century, with the English settlement of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as Canada's [[Maritime provinces]], and the control of sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, notably Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the [[Leeward Islands]], Barbados, Jamaica and Bermuda. These islands, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised Britain's most lucrative colonies in terms of profits flowing to the absentee owners (who lived in Britain). The American colonies also utilized slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo and rice in the south. Britain's American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Britain control over what is now most of Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|pages=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|pages=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |first= William R. |last= Nester\n |title= The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755\n |location= |publisher= Praeger |year = 2000\n |page=54 |isbn=978-0-275-96772-7\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Industrial Revolution: 1750s\u20131840s==\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] brought factories to Europe, especially England and Scotland, 1750s to 1830s.  France and the U.S. experienced its industrial revolution in the early 19th century; Germany in the 19th century; and to Russia in the early-mid 20th century.\n\nIn Britain, the Industrial Revolution was a period of economic transformation from the  1750s to the 1830s, characterized by the growth of a new system comprising factories, railroads, coal mining and business enterprises using new technologies that it sponsored.  The new system operated first on textiles, then spread to other sectors and by the mid 19th century totally transformed the British economy and society, setting up sustained growth; it spread to parts of America and Europe and modernized the world economy.  Although localized to certain parts of Britain (the London area was not included), its impact was felt worldwide on migration and trade, society and politics, on cities and countryside, and affected the remotest areas.  The growth rate in the British GDP was 1.5% per year (1770\u20131815), doubling to 3.0% (1815\u20131831).<ref>C.H. Feinstein, \"National Statistics, 1760\u20131920\", in C.H. Feinstein and S.

Entrepreneurs found uses for stationary engines in turning the machines in a factory or the pumps at a mine, while mobile engines were put into locomotives and ships (where they turned paddles or, later, propellers). The use of water power was growing too, so that in 1830 steam mills and water mills were about equal (at 165,000 horsepower each); by 1879 Britain obtained 2.1 million  horsepower from steam engines, and 230,000 from water.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Nicholas |last=Crafts |title=Steam as a General Purpose Technology: a Growth Accounting Perspective |journal=Economic Journal |year=2004 |volume=114 |issue=495 |pages=338\u201351 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2003.00200.x  |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22354/1/wp75.pdf }} Crafts also estimates that all technological innovations, including steam engines, accounted for about 18% of British economic growth from 1780 to 1830, and 31% from 1830 to 1870.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n{{Further|Industrial Revolution#Belgium}}\nNo one expected that Belgium-seemingly a \"sluggish\" and \"culturally dormant\" bastion of traditionalism-would leap\u2013 to the forefront of the industrial revolution on the Continent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Schama |title=The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330 |journal=History of Education |year=1972 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201389 |doi=10.1080/0046760720010106 }}</ref>  Nevertheless, Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the industrial revolution took place and it set the pace for all of continental Europe, while leaving the Netherlands behind.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Mokyr |title=The Industrial Revolution in the Low Countries in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century: A Comparative Case Study |journal=Journal of Economic History |year=1974 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=365\u201399 |jstor=2116987 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700080116 }}</ref>\n\nIndustrialization took place in [[Wallonia]] (French-speaking southern Belgium), starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after 1830. The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories  integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Evans |first2=G\u00f6ran |last2=Ryd\u00e9n |title=The Industrial Revolution in Iron; The impact of British Coal Technology in Nineteenth-Century Europe |location= |publisher=Ashgate |year=2005 |pages=37\u201338 |isbn=978-0-7546-3390-7 }}</ref>  By 1830, when iron became important the Belgium coal industry had long been established, and used steam-engines for pumping. Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia.  The textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. [[Ghent]] was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to [[Li\u00e8ge]], with its steel industry.<ref>{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Strikwerda |title=A House Divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish Nationalists in Nineteenth-Century Belgium |location= |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=1997 |pages=44\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8476-8526-4 }}</ref>\n\nCheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The ''[[Sillon industriel]]'' (''Industrial Valley''), and in particular the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' around [[Charleroi]], were the center of the steel industry until the 1940s.\n\n===Railways===\n{{see|History of rail transport}}\nThe growth of industry soon brought to light the need for a better system of transportation. While canals and roads did improve, they were soon overshadowed by a means of transportation that held great promise: the railroads. The railroads may have been that most important factor of the industrial revolution. Railways had existed as early as 1500, but in 1700s the primitive wooden rails were replaced with wrought iron. These new rails enabled horses to pull even heavier loads with relative ease. But dependence on horsepower did not last for long. In 1804, the first steam-powered locomotive pulled 10 tons of ore and 70 people at 5 miles per hour. This new technology improved dramatically; locomotives soon reached speeds of 50 miles per hour. While the railroads revolutionized transportation, they further contributed to the growth of the industrial revolution by causing a great increase in the demand for iron and coal.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=O\u2019Brien |title=Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830\u20131914 |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-333-33000-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Iron and steel===\nThroughout the Middle Ages iron was smelted using charcoal, however in the eighteenth century, new methods of iron production were discovered; the resulting iron was of higher quality than ever before. These advances, such as the process developed by Henry Cort in the 1780s, greatly encouraged the use of machinery in other industries.\n\nIron was so durable that it became the preferred metal for tools and equipment until displaced by steel after 1860.<ref>Small amounts of steel were produced before the 1860s, but it was five times stronger than cast iron.</ref>  Britain had iron ores but lacked a process to produce iron in quantity until in 1760 John Smeaton invented a blast furnace that could smelt iron both quickly and cheaply.  His invention used an air-blast produced by a fan run by a waterwheel. In 1783, Henry Cort introduced the puddling, or reverberatory furnace, in which the final product was a pasty solid instead of a liquid. It was rolled into balls, squeezed and rolled to eliminate the impurities, or slag.  The result was malleable iron in large quantities.  The greatest of the early ironmasters, John Wilkinson (1728\u20131808) invented new machinery to process the iron. In 1779, the first cast-iron bridge was constructed across the Severn; in 1790 the first iron ship was launched. By 1830, Britain was producing 700,000 tons of iron a year; the amount quadrupled a quarter-century later, with centers in Scotland, South Wales, and Staffordshire. Railway builders were the chief customer. In 1847\u201348 they bought 3 million tons for rolling stock, bridge building, and station building for 2000 new miles, plus the demands of the 3000 previously built miles of railway.<ref>John Clapham, ''An Economic History of Modern Britain'' (1952)  1:425\u201328</ref>\n\n==Germany between the wars==\nAfter the war, Germany was supposed to pay all of the war [[war reparations|reparations]] according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The policy angered the Germans and caused deep resentment, especially of the sort that the Nazis capitalized upon.  However the sums actually paid were not large, and were financed by loans from New York in the [[Dawes Plan]]. Payments ended in 1931, but in the 1950s West Germany did pay all the reparations.  There was an overwhelming inflation in 1923 caused by the government's pumping out paper money. The reconstruction period was based on private investment and demand. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the investors who had been financing Germany pulled out, crippling its economy as unemployment soared to 25%.<ref>Kruedener, Jurgen Baron von.

[[World War II]] was a [[total war]] that was ultimately decided in the factories and workplaces of the  [[Allies of World War II]], which had a much better performance than the [[Axis powers]]. Indeed, Germany and Japan depended as much or more on plunder of conquered territories than they did on their own production. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree. The success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences on the [[Home front during World War I]] and tried to use its lessons and avoid its possible sources of error. The home front engaged in several activities to help the British army and navy, including taking down metal fences and gates to replace them with stone or wood. The metal was then melted down, and used for battle ships or planes.<ref>I.C.B. Dear, and M.R.D. Foot, eds.

It played a major role in the economic recovery, modernization, and unification of Europe. In three years the ERP gave away $12.4 billion (about 5% of the 1948 American GDP of $270 billion) for modernizing the economic and financial systems and rebuilding the industrial and human capital of war-torn Europe, including Britain, Germany, France, Italy and smaller nations.  It required each government to set up a national economic plan, and for the countries to cooperate in terms of financial and trade flows. The money was not a loan and there was no repayment. Washington spent such vast sums because it was believed to be cheaper than the rearmament that isolationism or rollback would entail. In the long run, the logic went, a prosperous Europe would be more peaceful, and would make its main trading partner, the US, more prosperous. Stalin refused to allow any of his satellites to participate, the plan became exclusive to western Europe. However, the US extended a similar financial aid program to Japan at the same time.<ref>Martin Schain, ed., ''The Marshall Plan: Fifty Years After'' (2001).</ref>\n\nHistorians reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs, chiefly from the United States.  Bradford De Long and Barry Eichengreen conclude it was, \" History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\">{{cite book |first=J.

The powerful combination of ERP and [[NATO]] (1949) gave Europe the assurance of America's commitment to the security and prosperity of Western Europe, and helped the recipients avoid the pessimism and despair that characterized the aftermath of World War I. The Marshall Plan thus created in Europe an unstoppable \"revolution of rising expectations,\" the striking phrase coined in 1950 by Harlan Cleveland, an economist and senior ERP official.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain, and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947\u20131952'' (1987).</ref><ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\"/>\n\n===European Coal and Steel Community===\n{{Main|European Coal and Steel Community}}\nSix European nations, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands took a step toward economic integration with the formation of a [[common market]] of [[coal]] and [[steel]]. They formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951.   The idea was to stream-line coal and steel production.  A side-benefit would be economic interdependence.  Thereby, there would be less risk of Economic warfare or even a shooting war between the member nations.<ref>Louis Lister, ''Europe's Coal and Steel Community: an experiment in economic union'' (1960).</ref>\n\n===Industrial decline===\nThe decades from the 1960s saw an economic decline in the output of the more developed nations of Europe, particularly in France and the UK.  These nations' positions in output of refined raw materials, e.g. steel, and in finished goods fell in contrast to Asian countries. \nSeveral Asian nations made use of [[comparative advantage]] and specialized in producing certain goods, utilizing comparably cheaper labor forces.  First this occurred in [[Japan]] and the four \"[[Asian Tigers (economics)|Asian Tigers]]\" ([[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]); by the latter half of the 1980s the shift of industrial production began occurring in the [[newly industrializing countries]]. \nFirst, the shift occurred in cheaper, lower technology products, such as [[textiles]].  Then, this shift occurred in higher-technology goods, such \"durables\" as [[refrigerator]]s or [[automobile]]s.  The shift of international industrial production out of Europe is a key outcome of [[globalization]].\n\n==The Euro==\n\n===Introduction of the Euro===\n\nThe [[Euro]] became the official currency of certain [[European Union]] members on January 1, 2001.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/euro/Intro.html]</ref> The currency was signed into effect in 1992 in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]. The initial idea behind the Euro was that it eliminates [[exchange rate]]s between European nations and makes [[currency]] fluctuation risks minimal.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/the_euro6476_en.htm Why the Euro?]</ref>\n\n===Countries involved===\n\nThe nations involved in the initial treaty were Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. These nations agreed in principle to the [[European Monetary Union]] (EMU) in 1999 and installed the Euro as its currency on January 1, 2001. More European countries agreed to join the union in the following years; Slovenia (2007), Cyprus and Malta (2008), and Slovakia (2009).<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/the_euro6482_en.htm European Commission \u2013 Economic and Financial Affairs]</ref> Countries are only allowed to begin utilizing the Euro when they have met certain requirements set about by the EMU.
