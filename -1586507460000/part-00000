The carrier had stopped earlier in Hawaii to pick up approximately 900 \"Tigers\" \u2013 friends and family of the sailors aboard the ship who traveled with the ship from Hawaii to San Diego.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, ''Carl Vinson'' began preparations for a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) period. PIA is a major maintenance phase that all American naval vessels must go through multiple times throughout their lifetime to be able to sustain underway operations. PIA 2012\u20132013 for ''Carl Vinson'' included overhauls of over 40 crew living spaces, 30 heads and hundreds of workspaces throughout the ship. Also included were upgrades to many of the electronics and defense systems that the ship uses during deployments, to include an upgrade from the [[Global Command and Control System]]-Maritime (GCCS-M) to the [[Distributed Common Ground System]]-Navy (DCGS-N).\n\nOn 30 January 2013, ''Carl Vinson'' commenced sea trials, marking her first time underway in seven months, since the ammo offload which ended on 29 June 2012. Upon returning from this underway period, the ship's commanding officer, then Captain [[Kent D. Whalen]], announced on 2 February 2013 that PIA had officially ended, marking the first on-time PIA completion since 1999. Since February 2013, the ship has been underway multiple times conducting carrier qualifications with [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen]] as well as multiple crew certification exercises. The most recent accomplishment for ''Carl Vinson'' was the completion of her evaluation of nuclear reactor operation. During this evaluation, the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] embarks a team of proctors who put the ship's engineering department through a multitude of drills and exercises to test their ability to safely operate a nuclear reactor and to contain any casualty of the reactor as it occurs. This was completed on 1 July 2013.\n\nOn 22 August 2014, ''Carl Vinson'' and assigned [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen|CVW-17]] began a scheduled deployment to the U.S. [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th]] and [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] areas of responsibility. {{USS|Bunker Hill|CG-52|6}}, Destroyer Squadron 1 and its ships {{USS|Gridley|DDG-101|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|DDG-104|6}}, and {{USS|Dewey|DDG-105|6}} deployed with the carrier as part of the ''Carl Vinson'' Carrier Strike Group (CSG).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=82909 |title=Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group Departs for Deployment |author=Commander, U.S. Third Fleet Public Affairs |date=22 August 2014 |website=U.S. Navy |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153224/https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=82909 |archive-date=16 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The carrier was deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve USS ''George H.

The body of [[Osama bin Laden]] was buried at sea in 2011 from the deck of ''Carl Vinson'', and that same year, on [[Veterans Day]], she played host to the first [[2011\u201312 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|NCAA basketball]] game on an aircraft carrier, between [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]].\n\n==Namesake==\n[[File:Ceremonies for marking the 90th birthday of former Congressman Vinson of Georgia - NARA - 194554.tif|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]], Navy Secretary [[John Warner]], and Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] present Congressman Vinson (third from left) with a model of the ship that will bear his name, 18 November 1973.]]\nA member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for 50 years, Carl Vinson was, for 29 years, the Chairman of the House Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committee; Vinson was the principal sponsor of the so-called \"Vinson Acts\", culminating in the [[Two-Ocean Navy Act]] of 1940, which provided for the massive naval shipbuilding effort in World War II.\n\n===Ship seal===\nThe seal of USS ''Carl Vinson'' shows an eagle, wings spread and talons extended, carrying a banner in its beak. The eagle is emblematic of the nation and the ship's motto, and also represents the power that resides in the ship's aircraft. The eagle flies in the form of a stylized letter \"V,\" the initial of the ship's namesake, Congressman Carl Vinson. The \"V\" also represents the ship's hull when viewed bow-on.

The carrier had stopped earlier in Hawaii to pick up approximately 900 \"Tigers\" \u2013 friends and family of the sailors aboard the ship who traveled with the ship from Hawaii to San Diego.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, ''Carl Vinson'' began preparations for a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) period. PIA is a major maintenance phase that all American naval vessels must go through multiple times throughout their lifetime to be able to sustain underway operations. PIA 2012\u20132013 for ''Carl Vinson'' included overhauls of over 40 crew living spaces, 30 heads and hundreds of workspaces throughout the ship. Also included were upgrades to many of the electronics and defense systems that the ship uses during deployments, to include an upgrade from the [[Global Command and Control System]]-Maritime (GCCS-M) to the [[Distributed Common Ground System]]-Navy (DCGS-N).\n\nOn 30 January 2013, ''Carl Vinson'' commenced sea trials, marking her first time underway in seven months, since the ammo offload which ended on 29 June 2012. Upon returning from this underway period, the ship's commanding officer, then Captain [[Kent D. Whalen]], announced on 2 February 2013 that PIA had officially ended, marking the first on-time PIA completion since 1999. Since February 2013, the ship has been underway multiple times conducting carrier qualifications with [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen]] as well as multiple crew certification exercises. The most recent accomplishment for ''Carl Vinson'' was the completion of her evaluation of nuclear reactor operation. During this evaluation, the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] embarks a team of proctors who put the ship's engineering department through a multitude of drills and exercises to test their ability to safely operate a nuclear reactor and to contain any casualty of the reactor as it occurs. This was completed on 1 July 2013.\n\nOn 22 August 2014, ''Carl Vinson'' and assigned [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen|CVW-17]] began a scheduled deployment to the U.S. [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th]] and [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] areas of responsibility. {{USS|Bunker Hill|CG-52|6}}, Destroyer Squadron 1 and its ships {{USS|Gridley|DDG-101|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|DDG-104|6}}, and {{USS|Dewey|DDG-105|6}} deployed with the carrier as part of the ''Carl Vinson'' Carrier Strike Group (CSG).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=82909 |title=Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group Departs for Deployment |author=Commander, U.S. Third Fleet Public Affairs |date=22 August 2014 |website=U.S. Navy |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153224/https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=82909 |archive-date=16 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The carrier was deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve USS ''George H.

The nitrogen farther away from the side chain is the 'tele' nitrogen and is denoted by a lowercase tau sign and the nitrogen closer to the side chain is the 'pros' nitrogen and is denoted by the pi sign.

Histamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]].\n\n== Synthesis and metabolism ==\nHistamine is derived from the [[decarboxylation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[histidine]], a reaction [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]] [[L-histidine decarboxylase]]. It is a [[hydrophilic]] [[vasoactive]] [[amine]].\n\n[[Image:Histidine decarboxylase.svg|thumb|center|433px|Conversion of [[histidine]] to histamine by [[histidine decarboxylase]]]]\n\nOnce formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary [[degradative enzyme]]s, [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]] or [[diamine oxidase]]. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the [[synapse]]s is primarily broken down by [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]], while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including [[MAO-B]] and [[ALDH2]], further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.\n\nBacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals.  A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, [[scombroid poisoning]], is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish.

Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury \u2014 the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels.  Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the [[brain]], where it functions as a neurotransmitter.  Another important site of histamine storage and release is the [[enterochromaffin-like cell|enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell]] of the [[stomach]].\n\nThe most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is [[immune system|immunologic]].  These cells, if sensitized by [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]] attached to their [[cell membrane|membranes]], [[degranulation|degranulate]] when exposed to the appropriate [[antigen]].  Certain [[amine]]s and [[alkaloid]]s, including such drugs as [[morphine]], and [[curare]] alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. [[Antibiotic]]s like [[polymyxin]] are also found to stimulate histamine release.\n\nHistamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[histamine receptors]], designated H<sub>1</sub> through H<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /> As of 2015, histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /><ref name=\"FGID mast cell\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Biological targets of histamine in the human body\n|-\n! {{nowrap|[[G-protein coupled receptor]]}} !!

It is known to be involved in 23 different physiological functions. Histamine is known to be involved in many physiological functions because of its chemical properties that allow it to be versatile in binding. It is Coulombic (able to carry a charge), conformational, and flexible. This allows it to interact and bind more easily.<ref name=\"Noszal, B. pp 15-28\">{{cite book |author1=Noszal, B. |author2=Kraszni, M. |author3=Racz, A. |chapter=Histamine: fundamentals of biological chemistry |editor1=Falus, A. |editor2=Grosman, N. |editor3=Darvas, Z. |title=Histamine: Biology and Medical Aspects |publisher=SpringMed |location=Budapest |year=2004 |isbn=380557715X |pages=15\u201328 }}</ref>\n\n=== Vasodilation and fall in blood pressure ===\nIt has been known for more than one hundred years that an intravenous injection of histamine causes a fall in the blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=HH|last2=Laidlaw|first2=PP|title=The physiological action of beta-iminazolylethylamine.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=31 December 1910|volume=41|issue=5|pages=318\u201344|pmid=16993030|pmc=1512903|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1910.sp001406}}</ref> The underlying mechanism concerns both vascular hyperpermeability and vasodilation.

The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a portion of the posterior [[hypothalamus]] known as the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] (TMN). The histamine neurons in this region comprise the [[Neurotransmitter#Histamine|brain's histamine system]], which projects widely throughout the brain and includes [[axonal projection]]s to the [[brain|cortex]], [[medial forebrain bundle]], and elsewhere. The histamine neurons in the TMN are involved in regulating the [[sleep-wake cycle]] and promote arousal when activated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = RE | last2 = Stevens | first2 = DR | last3 = Haas | first3 = HL| title = The Physiology of Brain Histamine | journal = Progress in Neurobiology| volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 637\u2013672 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11164999 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(00)00039-3}}</ref> The [[neural firing rate]] of histamine neurons in the TMN is strongly [[positively correlated]] with an individual's state of arousal. These neurons fire rapidly during periods of wakefulness, fire more slowly during periods of relaxation/tiredness, and stop firing altogether during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] and [[NREM]] (non-REM) sleep{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\nFirst-generation [[H1 antagonist|H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] (i.e., [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] of [[HRH1|histamine receptor H<sub>1</sub>]]) are capable of crossing the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and produce [[drowsiness]] by antagonizing histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors in the tuberomammillary nucleus. The newer class of [[H1 antagonist#Second-generation|second-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] do not readily permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the likelihood of a sedating effect. In contrast, [[H3 receptor antagonist|histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s increase wakefulness. Similar to the sedative effect of first-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines, an inability to maintain [[Alertness|vigilance]] can occur from the inhibition of histamine biosynthesis or the loss (i.e., degeneration or destruction) of histamine-releasing neurons in the TMN.\n\n=== Gastric acid release ===\n[[Enterochromaffin-like cell]]s, located within the gastric glands of the stomach, release histamine that stimulates nearby [[parietal cell]]s by binding to the apical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Stimulation of the parietal cell induces the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from the blood, which is then converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Inside the cytoplasm of the parietal cell, the carbonic acid readily dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions diffuse back through the basilar membrane and into the bloodstream, while the hydrogen ions are pumped into the lumen of the stomach via a [[P-type ATPase|K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump]]. Histamine release is halted when the pH of the stomach starts to decrease. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonist]] molecules, like [[ranitidine]], block the H<sub>2</sub> receptor and prevent histamine from binding, causing decreased hydrogen ion secretion.\n\n=== Protective effects ===\nWhile histamine has stimulatory effects upon neurons, it also has  suppressive ones that protect against the  susceptibility to [[convulsion]], drug sensitization, [[denervation supersensitivity]], ischemic lesions and stress.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yanai | first1 = K | last2 = Tashiro | first2 = M | title = The physiological and pathophysiological roles of neuronal histamine: an insight from human positron emission tomography studies. | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16890992 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.06.008 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that histamine controls the mechanisms by which memories and learning are forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = EO | title = The role of histamine on cognition. | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 183\u20139 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19126417 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.12.010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Erection and sexual function ===\nLibido loss and erectile failure can occur during treatment with histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists such as [[cimetidine]],  [[ranitidine]], and [[risperidone]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = JM | last2 = Rumbold | first2 = GR | title = Behavioural effects of histamine and its antagonists: a review. | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201314 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3133686 | doi=10.1007/bf00212757}}</ref> The injection of histamine into the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] in men with psychogenic impotence produces full or partial erections in 74% of them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Car\u00e1 | first1 = AM | last2 = Lopes-Martins | first2 = RA | last3 = Antunes | first3 = E | last4 = Nahoum | first4 = CR | last5 = De Nucci | first5 = G | title = The role of histamine in human penile erection. | journal = British Journal of Urology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 220\u20134 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7850330 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.1995.tb07315.x }}</ref> It has been suggested that H<sub>2</sub> antagonists may cause sexual difficulties by reducing the functional binding of testosterone to its endogenous receptors.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n=== Schizophrenia ===\nMetabolites of histamine are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with [[schizophrenia]], while the efficiency of H<sub>1</sub> receptor binding sites is decreased.

The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jadidi-Niaragh F, Mirshafiey A |title=Histamine and histamine receptors in pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=180\u20139 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20493888 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.05.005 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Disorders ==\nAs an integral part of the immune system, histamine may be involved in [[immune system disorder]]s<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E.

Histamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]].\n\n== Synthesis and metabolism ==\nHistamine is derived from the [[decarboxylation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[histidine]], a reaction [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]] [[L-histidine decarboxylase]]. It is a [[hydrophilic]] [[vasoactive]] [[amine]].\n\n[[Image:Histidine decarboxylase.svg|thumb|center|433px|Conversion of [[histidine]] to histamine by [[histidine decarboxylase]]]]\n\nOnce formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary [[degradative enzyme]]s, [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]] or [[diamine oxidase]]. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the [[synapse]]s is primarily broken down by [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]], while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including [[MAO-B]] and [[ALDH2]], further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.\n\nBacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals.  A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, [[scombroid poisoning]], is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish.  Fermented foods and beverages naturally contain small quantities of histamine due to a similar conversion performed by fermenting bacteria or yeasts.  [[Sake]] contains histamine in the 20\u201340&nbsp;mg/L range; [[wine]]s contain it in the 2\u201310&nbsp;mg/L range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110719065511/http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n== Storage and release ==\n[[Image:SMCpolyhydroxysmall.jpg|thumb|Mast cells.]]\nMost histamine in the body is generated in granules in [[mast cells]] and in white blood cells (leukocytes) called [[basophils]]. Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury \u2014 the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels.  Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the [[brain]], where it functions as a neurotransmitter.  Another important site of histamine storage and release is the [[enterochromaffin-like cell|enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell]] of the [[stomach]].\n\nThe most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is [[immune system|immunologic]].  These cells, if sensitized by [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]] attached to their [[cell membrane|membranes]], [[degranulation|degranulate]] when exposed to the appropriate [[antigen]].  Certain [[amine]]s and [[alkaloid]]s, including such drugs as [[morphine]], and [[curare]] alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. [[Antibiotic]]s like [[polymyxin]] are also found to stimulate histamine release.\n\nHistamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[histamine receptors]], designated H<sub>1</sub> through H<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /> As of 2015, histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /><ref name=\"FGID mast cell\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Biological targets of histamine in the human body\n|-\n! {{nowrap|[[G-protein coupled receptor]]}} !!

The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a portion of the posterior [[hypothalamus]] known as the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] (TMN). The histamine neurons in this region comprise the [[Neurotransmitter#Histamine|brain's histamine system]], which projects widely throughout the brain and includes [[axonal projection]]s to the [[brain|cortex]], [[medial forebrain bundle]], and elsewhere.

The newer class of [[H1 antagonist#Second-generation|second-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] do not readily permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the likelihood of a sedating effect. In contrast, [[H3 receptor antagonist|histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s increase wakefulness. Similar to the sedative effect of first-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines, an inability to maintain [[Alertness|vigilance]] can occur from the inhibition of histamine biosynthesis or the loss (i.e., degeneration or destruction) of histamine-releasing neurons in the TMN.\n\n=== Gastric acid release ===\n[[Enterochromaffin-like cell]]s, located within the gastric glands of the stomach, release histamine that stimulates nearby [[parietal cell]]s by binding to the apical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Stimulation of the parietal cell induces the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from the blood, which is then converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Inside the cytoplasm of the parietal cell, the carbonic acid readily dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions diffuse back through the basilar membrane and into the bloodstream, while the hydrogen ions are pumped into the lumen of the stomach via a [[P-type ATPase|K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump]]. Histamine release is halted when the pH of the stomach starts to decrease. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonist]] molecules, like [[ranitidine]], block the H<sub>2</sub> receptor and prevent histamine from binding, causing decreased hydrogen ion secretion.\n\n=== Protective effects ===\nWhile histamine has stimulatory effects upon neurons, it also has  suppressive ones that protect against the  susceptibility to [[convulsion]], drug sensitization, [[denervation supersensitivity]], ischemic lesions and stress.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yanai | first1 = K | last2 = Tashiro | first2 = M | title = The physiological and pathophysiological roles of neuronal histamine: an insight from human positron emission tomography studies. | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16890992 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.06.008 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that histamine controls the mechanisms by which memories and learning are forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = EO | title = The role of histamine on cognition. | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 183\u20139 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19126417 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.12.010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Erection and sexual function ===\nLibido loss and erectile failure can occur during treatment with histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists such as [[cimetidine]],  [[ranitidine]], and [[risperidone]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = JM | last2 = Rumbold | first2 = GR | title = Behavioural effects of histamine and its antagonists: a review. | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201314 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3133686 | doi=10.1007/bf00212757}}</ref> The injection of histamine into the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] in men with psychogenic impotence produces full or partial erections in 74% of them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Car\u00e1 | first1 = AM | last2 = Lopes-Martins | first2 = RA | last3 = Antunes | first3 = E | last4 = Nahoum | first4 = CR | last5 = De Nucci | first5 = G | title = The role of histamine in human penile erection. | journal = British Journal of Urology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 220\u20134 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7850330 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.1995.tb07315.x }}</ref> It has been suggested that H<sub>2</sub> antagonists may cause sexual difficulties by reducing the functional binding of testosterone to its endogenous receptors.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n=== Schizophrenia ===\nMetabolites of histamine are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with [[schizophrenia]], while the efficiency of H<sub>1</sub> receptor binding sites is decreased.

The different H receptors have been known to have different effects on the treatment of this disease. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jadidi-Niaragh F, Mirshafiey A |title=Histamine and histamine receptors in pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=180\u20139 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20493888 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.05.005 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Disorders ==\nAs an integral part of the immune system, histamine may be involved in [[immune system disorder]]s<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E.

Emil had married in 1883 the daughter of a rich textile manufacturer (Reichswolle AG) and he took charge of the company in 1900. He had three siblings: Gerhard, Werner and a younger sister named Edith. Werner married Eleanor Quandt, who after the Second World War helped to protect her brother-in-law, G\u00fcnther, from prosecution by the Allies. G\u00fcnther's sister Edith married the owner of another textile company. \n\nDuring [[World War I]], with G\u00fcnther in charge, the Quandts supplied the German army with uniforms, building up a larger fortune that G\u00fcnther would use after the war to acquire Accumulatorenfabrik AG (AFA), a battery manufacturer in [[Hagen]] that would become [[VARTA]], a potash-mining company, metal-working companies (including [[IWKA]]) and stakes in [[BMW]] and [[Daimler-Benz]].\n\nG\u00fcnther Quandt first married Antonie \u2018Toni\u2019 Ewald. They had two sons [[Helmut Quandt]] (1908\u20131927) and [[Herbert Quandt]].  Antonie died of the Spanish flu in 1918 and Helmut died of complications from appendicitis in 1927.\n\nHis second marriage on 4 January 1921 in [[Bad Godesberg]] to [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]] produced another son, [[Harald Quandt]].  Magda was half G\u00fcnther's age. The marriage ended in divorce in 1929.  Two years later Magda married [[Joseph Goebbels]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] as best man.\n\n==The Nazi period==\nAfter Hitler's appointment in 1933 Quandt joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]]. In 1937 Hitler gave him the title of a ''Wehrwirtschaftsf\u00fchrer,'' (Leader in the Defence Economy), like other industrialists who played a leading role in the war economy. Quandt's businesses supplied ammunition, rifles, artillery and batteries, using slave labourers from concentration camps in at least three factories. Hundreds of these labourers died. An execution area was set up in the grounds of AFA's Hanover factory.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,511193,00.html English summary of TV programme transmitted by ARD in October 2007]</ref> Quandt also appropriated factories throughout [[Europe]] after German invasions.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the US Senate held hearings on the operations of the German economy during the war. They found that Quandt was an important director in German industry, with a number of interlocking companies, syndicates and corporations. He had interest in such areas as insurance, banking, automobiles, ammunition, textiles, electricity, batteries and other areas.

To the surprise of many, he was judged to be a ''[[Mitl\u00e4ufer]]'' (fellow traveller), namely someone who accepted the [[National Socialist]] ideology but did not take an active part in crimes.  In January 1948, Quandt was released.  \n\nOne of the prosecutors in the [[Nuremberg trials]], Benjamin Ferencz, now says that if today's evidence against Quandt had been presented to the court at the time, \"Quandt would have been charged with the same offences as the directors of [[IG Farben]].\" The directors served up to eight years in jail. Instead Quandt was able to re-install himself in the supervisory boards of various German firms, e.g. Deutsche Bank. He also became honorary citizen of the University in [[Frankfurt]] in 1951. He died on vacation in [[Cairo]] on 30 December 1954. \n\nHis two surviving sons, Herbert and Harald, administered their inheritance together, though Harald Quandt concentrated on the industrial plants Karlsruhe Augsburg AG (IWKA) which were involved in mechanical engineering and arms manufacture, while Herbert Quandt managed the investments in AFA/VARTA, Daimler-Benz and BMW.\n\n==Further reading==\n* R\u00fcdiger Jungbluth: Die Quandts: Ihr leiser Aufstieg zur m\u00e4chtigsten Wirtschaftsdynastie Deutschlands.

In January 1948, Quandt was released.  \n\nOne of the prosecutors in the [[Nuremberg trials]], Benjamin Ferencz, now says that if today's evidence against Quandt had been presented to the court at the time, \"Quandt would have been charged with the same offences as the directors of [[IG Farben]].\" The directors served up to eight years in jail. Instead Quandt was able to re-install himself in the supervisory boards of various German firms, e.g. Deutsche Bank. He also became honorary citizen of the University in [[Frankfurt]] in 1951. He died on vacation in [[Cairo]] on 30 December 1954. \n\nHis two surviving sons, Herbert and Harald, administered their inheritance together, though Harald Quandt concentrated on the industrial plants Karlsruhe Augsburg AG (IWKA) which were involved in mechanical engineering and arms manufacture, while Herbert Quandt managed the investments in AFA/VARTA, Daimler-Benz and BMW.\n\n==Further reading==\n* R\u00fcdiger Jungbluth: Die Quandts: Ihr leiser Aufstieg zur m\u00e4chtigsten Wirtschaftsdynastie Deutschlands.

[[Pre-school]] education is designed for 3\u20135 years old and usually consists of three stages: Play Group, [[Nursery school|Nursery]] and [[Kindergarten]] (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school education, students go through [[junior school]] from grades 1 to 5. This is followed by [[middle school]] from grades 6 to 8. At middle school, [[single-sex education]] is usually preferred by the community, but [[co-education]] is also common in urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined disciplines are:\n* [[Arts]]\n* [[Computer science|Computer Studies]] and [[Information and Communication Technology|ICT]]\n* [[General Science]]\n* Modern languages with literature i.e. [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[English language|English]]\n* [[Mathematics]]\n* [[Religious Education]] i.e. [[Islamiyat|Islamic Studies]]\n* [[Social Studies]] (including [[Civics]], [[Geography]], [[History]], [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and sometimes elements of [[law]], [[politics]] and [[PHSE]])\nMost schools also offer [[Drama|drama studies]], [[music]] and [[physical education]] but these are usually not examined or marked. [[Home economics]] is sometimes taught to female students, whereas topics related to [[astronomy]], [[environmental management]] and [[psychology]] are frequently included in textbooks of general science. Sometimes [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] are extensively taught in textbooks of social studies. [[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]] is not taught at most schools in Pakistan although this trend is being rebuked by some urban schools. Provincial and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in language-medium schools. Some institutes give instruction in foreign languages such as [[German language|German]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The language of instruction depends on the nature of the institution itself, whether it is an English-medium school or an Urdu-medium school.\n\nAs of 2009, Pakistan faces a net primary school attendance rate for both sexes of 66 percent: a figure below estimated world average of 90 percent.<ref name=\"UNESCO Institute for Statistics\">{{cite web|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|title=Adjusted net enrolment ratio in primary education |url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=3340&IF_Language=eng |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nPakistan's poor performance in the education sector is mainly caused by the low level of public investment. {{As of|2007}}, public expenditure on education was 2.2 percent of GNPs, a marginal increase from 2 percent before 1984-85. In addition, the allocation of government funds is skewed towards higher education, allowing the upper income class to reap the majority of the benefits of public subsidy on education. Lower education institutions such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education. As a result, Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of literacy in the world and the lowest among countries of comparative resources and socio-economic situations.<ref name=\"Rasool Memon 2007 47\u201355\">{{cite journal|last=Rasool Memon|first=Ghulam|title=Education in Pakistan: The Key Issues, Problems and The New Challenges|journal=Journal of Management and Social Sciences|year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=1|pages=47\u201355 |url=http://www.international.ac.uk/resources/Education%20in%20Pakistan%20-%20The%20Key%20Issues,%20Problems%20and%20The%20New%20Challenges.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Secondary education===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nSecondary education in Pakistan begins from grade 9 and lasts for four years. After end of each of the school years, students are required to pass a national examination administered by a regional Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (or BISE).\n\nUpon completion of grade 9, students are expected to take a standardised test in each of the first parts of their academic subjects. They again give these tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of grade 10. Upon successful completion of these examinations, they are awarded a [[Secondary School Certificate]] (or SSC). This is locally termed a '[[Matriculation in Pakistan|matriculation certificate]]' or 'matric' for short. The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies).\n\nStudents then enter an [[Junior college|intermediate college]] and complete grades 11 and 12. Upon completion of each of the two grades, they again take standardised tests in their academic subjects. Upon successful completion of these examinations, students are awarded the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the FSc/FA/ICS or 'intermediate'. There are many streams students can choose for their 11 and 12 grades, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream consists of three electives and as well as three compulsory subjects of English, Urdu, Islamiat (grade 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (grade 12 only).\n\nAlternative qualifications in Pakistan are available but are maintained by other [[examination board]]s instead of BISE. Most common alternative is the [[General Certificate of Education]] (or GCE), where SSC and HSSC are replaced by [[Ordinary Level]] (or O Level) and [[Advanced Level]] (or A Level) respectively. Other qualifications include [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] which replaces SSC. GCE and GCSE O Level, IGCSE and GCE AS/A Level are managed by British examination boards of [[University of Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]] of the [[Cambridge Assessment]] and/or Edexcel International of the [[Pearson PLC]]. Generally, 8-10 courses are selected by students at GCE O Levels and 3-5 at GCE A Levels.\n\n[[Advanced Placement]] (or AP) is an alternative option but much less common than GCE or IGCSE. This replaces the secondary school education as 'High School Education' instead. AP exams are monitored by a North American examination board, [[College Board]], and can only be given under supervision of centers which are registered with the College Board, unlike GCE O/AS/A Level and IGCSE which can be given privately.\n\nAnother type of education in Pakistan is called \"Technical Education\" and combines technical and vocational education. The vocational curriculum starts at grade 5 and ends with grade 10.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\">{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&ct=PAK | title=Vocational education in Pakistan | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Three boards, the Punjab Board of Technical Education (PBTE), KPK Board of Technical Education (KPKBTE) and Sindh Board of Technical Education (SBTE) offering Matric Tech. course called [[Technical School Certificate]] (TSC) (equivalent to 10th grade) and [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE) in engineering disciplines like Civil, Chemical, Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, Computer etc. DAE is a three years program of instructions which is equivalent to 12th grade. Diploma holders are called associate engineers. They can either join their respective field or take admission in [[B.Tech.]] and [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] in their related discipline after DAE.\n\nFurthermore, the A level qualification, inherited by the British education system is widely gained in the private schools of Pakistan. Three to four subjects are selected, based on the interest of the student. It is usually divided into a combination of similar subjects within the same category, like Business, Arts and Sciences. This is a two-year program. A level institutions are different from high school. You must secure admission in such an institution, upon the completion of high school, i.e. the British system equivalent being O levels. O levels and A levels are usually not taught within the same school.\n\n===Tertiary education===\n[[File:June21-2004-ThePunjabUniversity-OldCampusBuilding-1.jpeg|thumb|The [[University of the Punjab]], established 1882 in Lahore, is the oldest university of Pakistan.]]\n\nAccording to UNESCO's 2009 Global Education Digest, 6% of Pakistanis (9% of men and 3.5% of women) were university graduates as of 2007.<ref name=\"UNESCO 2009\">{{cite book|title=Global Education Digest 2009 |url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/ged09-en.pdf|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |year=2009}}</ref> Pakistan plans to increase this figure to 10% by 2015 and subsequently to 15% by 2020.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/13+cabinet+approves+education+policy+2009-za-08] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912051457/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/13+cabinet+approves+education+policy+2009-za-08|date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> There is also a great deal of variety between age cohorts.

These courses require four or five years of study. The accreditation councils which accredit the above professional degrees and register these professionals are: [[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC), [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] (PMDC), [[Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council]] (PVMC), [[Pakistan Bar Council]] (PBC), [[Pakistan Council for Architects and Town Planners]] (PCATP), [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] (PCP) and [[Pakistan Nursing Council]] (PNC). Students can also attend a university for [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom) or [[BBA|Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree courses.\n\nThere are two types of Bachelor courses in Pakistan: Pass or Honors. Pass degree requires two years of study and students normally read three optional subjects (such as [[Chemistry]] or [[Economics]]) in addition to almost equal number of compulsory subjects (such as [[English studies|English]], islamiyat and [[Pakistan Studies]]). Honours degree requires four years of study, and students normally specialize in a chosen field of study, such as [[Biochemistry]] (BSc Hons. Biochemistry).\n\nPass Bachelors is now slowly being phased out for Honours throughout the country.\n\n\n===Quaternary education===\nMost of [[Master's degree]] programs require two years education. [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil) is available in most of the subjects and can be undertaken after doing Masters. [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) education is available in selected areas and is usually pursued after earning a MPhil degree. Students pursuing MPhil or PhD degrees must choose a specific field and a university that is doing research work in that field. MPhil and PhD education in Pakistan requires a minimum of two years of study.\n\n===Nonformal and informal education===\nOut of the formal system, the public sectors runs numerous schools and training centres, most being vocational-oriented. Among those institutions can be found vocational schools, technical training centres and agriculture and vocational training centres. An [[apprenticeship]] system is also framed by the state of Pakistan.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/> Informal education is also important in Pakistan and regroups mostly school-leavers and low-skilled individuals, who are trained under the supervision of a senior craftsman.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/> Few institutes are run by corporates to train university students eligible for jobs and provide experience during education fulfilling a gap between university and industry for example: Appxone Private Limited is training Engineers with professional development on major subjects of Electronics and Computer science and other fields.\n\n==Gender disparity==\n{{See also|Women's education in Pakistan}}\nIn Pakistan, gender discrimination in education occurs among the poorest households but is non-existent among rich households.<ref name=\"EFA\">{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf |title=Youth and skills: putting education to work, EFA global monitoringthereport, 2012; 2013|date=|accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref>{{pn|date=September 2019}} Only 18% of Pakistani women have received 10 years or more of schooling.<ref name=\"EFA\"/>{{pn|date=September 2019}} Among other criticisms the Pakistani education system faces is the gender disparity in enrollment levels. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem. In 1990-91, the female to male ratio (F/M ratio) of enrollment was 0.47 for primary level of education. It reached to 0.74 in 1999-2000, showing the F/M ratio has improved by 57.44% within the decade. For the middle level of education it was 0.42 in the start of decade and increased to 0.68 by the end of decade, so it has improved almost 62%. In both cases the gender disparity is decreased but relatively more rapidly at middle level.<ref name=TasnimKhan>{{cite web | last =Khan | first =Tasnim |author2=Khan, Rana Ejaz Ali | title =Gender Disparity in Education - Extents, Trends and Factors | publisher =Journal of Research (Faculty of Languages & Islamic Studies) | year =2004 | url =http://bzu.edu.pk/jrlanguages/Vol-5%202004/Tasnim%20Khan%20&%20Rana%20Ejaz-3.pdf | accessdate =2009-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe gender disparity in enrollment at secondary level of education was 0.4 in 1990-91 and 0.67 in 1999-2000, showing that the disparity decreased by 67.5% in the decade. At the college level, it was 0.50 in 1990-91 and reached 0.81 in 1999-2000, showing that the disparity decreased by 64%. The gender disparity has decreased comparatively rapidly at secondary school.<ref name=TasnimKhan/>\n\nThere is great difference in the rates of enrollment of boys, as compared to girls in Pakistan. According to UNESCO figures, primary school enrollment for girls stand at 60 per cent as compared to 84 percent for boys. The secondary school enrollment rate stands at a lower rate of 32 percent for females and 46 per cent males. Regular school attendance for female students is estimated at 41 per cent while that for male students is 50 per cent.<ref name=\"UNESCO Institute for Statistics\"/>\n\nA particularly interesting aspect of this gender disparity is representation of Pakistani [[Women in STEM fields|women in STEMM]] (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine). In 2013, the issue of [[Women in medicine|women doctors]] in Pakistan was highlighted in local and international media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1032070|title=The doctor brides|last=Zakaria|first=Rafia|date=2013-07-26|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}</ref> <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34042751|title=Are Pakistan's female medical students to be doctors or wives?|date=2015-08-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/08/30/pakistan-sees-high-rate-of-female-medical-students-but-few-doctors/|title=Pakistan sees high rate of female medical students, but few doctors|date=2015-08-30|work=Women in the World in Association with The New York Times - WITW|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-house-in-pakistan-quite-possibly-1.305653|title=Is there a doctor in the house?

The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972\u201373 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but it is not going to be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be \"invented\" by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an \"unconventional\" approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can \"invent\" the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Increasing Education Expenditure to 7 percent of GDP in Pakistan: Eyes on the Miracle |newspaper=Business Recorder|location=Islamabad|date=4 July 2010|url=http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?show=&&id=1076881&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate=|accessdate=<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>\n\n==University rankings==\n{{Main article|Rankings of universities in Pakistan}}\nAccording to the Quality Standard World University Ranking for 2014, [[Quaid-e-Azam University|QAU]], [[institute of Space Technology|IST]], [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences|PIEAS]], [[Aga Khan University|AKU]], [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|NUST]], [[Lahore University of Management Sciences|LUMS]], [[COMSATS University Islamabad|CUI]], [[University of Karachi|KU]] and [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|UET Lahore]] are ranked among top 300 universities in [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2014#sorting=rank+region=+country=120+faculty=+stars=false+search= |title=QS University Rankings: Asia 2014 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Religion and education==\n\nEducation in Pakistan is heavily influenced by religion.

[[Pre-school]] education is designed for 3\u20135 years old and usually consists of three stages: Play Group, [[Nursery school|Nursery]] and [[Kindergarten]] (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school education, students go through [[junior school]] from grades 1 to 5. This is followed by [[middle school]] from grades 6 to 8. At middle school, [[single-sex education]] is usually preferred by the community, but [[co-education]] is also common in urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined disciplines are:\n* [[Arts]]\n* [[Computer science|Computer Studies]] and [[Information and Communication Technology|ICT]]\n* [[General Science]]\n* Modern languages with literature i.e. [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[English language|English]]\n* [[Mathematics]]\n* [[Religious Education]] i.e. [[Islamiyat|Islamic Studies]]\n* [[Social Studies]] (including [[Civics]], [[Geography]], [[History]], [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and sometimes elements of [[law]], [[politics]] and [[PHSE]])\nMost schools also offer [[Drama|drama studies]], [[music]] and [[physical education]] but these are usually not examined or marked. [[Home economics]] is sometimes taught to female students, whereas topics related to [[astronomy]], [[environmental management]] and [[psychology]] are frequently included in textbooks of general science. Sometimes [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] are extensively taught in textbooks of social studies. [[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]] is not taught at most schools in Pakistan although this trend is being rebuked by some urban schools. Provincial and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in language-medium schools. Some institutes give instruction in foreign languages such as [[German language|German]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The language of instruction depends on the nature of the institution itself, whether it is an English-medium school or an Urdu-medium school.\n\nAs of 2009, Pakistan faces a net primary school attendance rate for both sexes of 66 percent: a figure below estimated world average of 90 percent.<ref name=\"UNESCO Institute for Statistics\">{{cite web|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|title=Adjusted net enrolment ratio in primary education |url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=3340&IF_Language=eng |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nPakistan's poor performance in the education sector is mainly caused by the low level of public investment. {{As of|2007}}, public expenditure on education was 2.2 percent of GNPs, a marginal increase from 2 percent before 1984-85. In addition, the allocation of government funds is skewed towards higher education, allowing the upper income class to reap the majority of the benefits of public subsidy on education. Lower education institutions such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education. As a result, Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of literacy in the world and the lowest among countries of comparative resources and socio-economic situations.<ref name=\"Rasool Memon 2007 47\u201355\">{{cite journal|last=Rasool Memon|first=Ghulam|title=Education in Pakistan: The Key Issues, Problems and The New Challenges|journal=Journal of Management and Social Sciences|year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=1|pages=47\u201355 |url=http://www.international.ac.uk/resources/Education%20in%20Pakistan%20-%20The%20Key%20Issues,%20Problems%20and%20The%20New%20Challenges.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Secondary education===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nSecondary education in Pakistan begins from grade 9 and lasts for four years. After end of each of the school years, students are required to pass a national examination administered by a regional Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (or BISE).\n\nUpon completion of grade 9, students are expected to take a standardised test in each of the first parts of their academic subjects. They again give these tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of grade 10. Upon successful completion of these examinations, they are awarded a [[Secondary School Certificate]] (or SSC). This is locally termed a '[[Matriculation in Pakistan|matriculation certificate]]' or 'matric' for short. The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies).\n\nStudents then enter an [[Junior college|intermediate college]] and complete grades 11 and 12. Upon completion of each of the two grades, they again take standardised tests in their academic subjects. Upon successful completion of these examinations, students are awarded the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the FSc/FA/ICS or 'intermediate'. There are many streams students can choose for their 11 and 12 grades, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream consists of three electives and as well as three compulsory subjects of English, Urdu, Islamiat (grade 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (grade 12 only).\n\nAlternative qualifications in Pakistan are available but are maintained by other [[examination board]]s instead of BISE. Most common alternative is the [[General Certificate of Education]] (or GCE), where SSC and HSSC are replaced by [[Ordinary Level]] (or O Level) and [[Advanced Level]] (or A Level) respectively. Other qualifications include [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] which replaces SSC. GCE and GCSE O Level, IGCSE and GCE AS/A Level are managed by British examination boards of [[University of Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]] of the [[Cambridge Assessment]] and/or Edexcel International of the [[Pearson PLC]]. Generally, 8-10 courses are selected by students at GCE O Levels and 3-5 at GCE A Levels.\n\n[[Advanced Placement]] (or AP) is an alternative option but much less common than GCE or IGCSE. This replaces the secondary school education as 'High School Education' instead. AP exams are monitored by a North American examination board, [[College Board]], and can only be given under supervision of centers which are registered with the College Board, unlike GCE O/AS/A Level and IGCSE which can be given privately.\n\nAnother type of education in Pakistan is called \"Technical Education\" and combines technical and vocational education. The vocational curriculum starts at grade 5 and ends with grade 10.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\">{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&ct=PAK | title=Vocational education in Pakistan | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Three boards, the Punjab Board of Technical Education (PBTE), KPK Board of Technical Education (KPKBTE) and Sindh Board of Technical Education (SBTE) offering Matric Tech. course called [[Technical School Certificate]] (TSC) (equivalent to 10th grade) and [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE) in engineering disciplines like Civil, Chemical, Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, Computer etc. DAE is a three years program of instructions which is equivalent to 12th grade. Diploma holders are called associate engineers. They can either join their respective field or take admission in [[B.Tech.]] and [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] in their related discipline after DAE.\n\nFurthermore, the A level qualification, inherited by the British education system is widely gained in the private schools of Pakistan. Three to four subjects are selected, based on the interest of the student. It is usually divided into a combination of similar subjects within the same category, like Business, Arts and Sciences. This is a two-year program. A level institutions are different from high school. You must secure admission in such an institution, upon the completion of high school, i.e. the British system equivalent being O levels. O levels and A levels are usually not taught within the same school.\n\n===Tertiary education===\n[[File:June21-2004-ThePunjabUniversity-OldCampusBuilding-1.jpeg|thumb|The [[University of the Punjab]], established 1882 in Lahore, is the oldest university of Pakistan.]]\n\nAccording to UNESCO's 2009 Global Education Digest, 6% of Pakistanis (9% of men and 3.5% of women) were university graduates as of 2007.<ref name=\"UNESCO 2009\">{{cite book|title=Global Education Digest 2009 |url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/ged09-en.pdf|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |year=2009}}</ref> Pakistan plans to increase this figure to 10% by 2015 and subsequently to 15% by 2020.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/13+cabinet+approves+education+policy+2009-za-08] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912051457/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/13+cabinet+approves+education+policy+2009-za-08|date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> There is also a great deal of variety between age cohorts.

These courses require four or five years of study. The accreditation councils which accredit the above professional degrees and register these professionals are: [[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC), [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] (PMDC), [[Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council]] (PVMC), [[Pakistan Bar Council]] (PBC), [[Pakistan Council for Architects and Town Planners]] (PCATP), [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] (PCP) and [[Pakistan Nursing Council]] (PNC). Students can also attend a university for [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom) or [[BBA|Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree courses.\n\nThere are two types of Bachelor courses in Pakistan: Pass or Honors. Pass degree requires two years of study and students normally read three optional subjects (such as [[Chemistry]] or [[Economics]]) in addition to almost equal number of compulsory subjects (such as [[English studies|English]], islamiyat and [[Pakistan Studies]]). Honours degree requires four years of study, and students normally specialize in a chosen field of study, such as [[Biochemistry]] (BSc Hons. Biochemistry).\n\nPass Bachelors is now slowly being phased out for Honours throughout the country.\n\n\n===Quaternary education===\nMost of [[Master's degree]] programs require two years education. [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil) is available in most of the subjects and can be undertaken after doing Masters. [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) education is available in selected areas and is usually pursued after earning a MPhil degree. Students pursuing MPhil or PhD degrees must choose a specific field and a university that is doing research work in that field. MPhil and PhD education in Pakistan requires a minimum of two years of study.\n\n===Nonformal and informal education===\nOut of the formal system, the public sectors runs numerous schools and training centres, most being vocational-oriented. Among those institutions can be found vocational schools, technical training centres and agriculture and vocational training centres. An [[apprenticeship]] system is also framed by the state of Pakistan.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/> Informal education is also important in Pakistan and regroups mostly school-leavers and low-skilled individuals, who are trained under the supervision of a senior craftsman.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/> Few institutes are run by corporates to train university students eligible for jobs and provide experience during education fulfilling a gap between university and industry for example: Appxone Private Limited is training Engineers with professional development on major subjects of Electronics and Computer science and other fields.\n\n==Gender disparity==\n{{See also|Women's education in Pakistan}}\nIn Pakistan, gender discrimination in education occurs among the poorest households but is non-existent among rich households.<ref name=\"EFA\">{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf |title=Youth and skills: putting education to work, EFA global monitoringthereport, 2012; 2013|date=|accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref>{{pn|date=September 2019}} Only 18% of Pakistani women have received 10 years or more of schooling.<ref name=\"EFA\"/>{{pn|date=September 2019}} Among other criticisms the Pakistani education system faces is the gender disparity in enrollment levels. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem. In 1990-91, the female to male ratio (F/M ratio) of enrollment was 0.47 for primary level of education. It reached to 0.74 in 1999-2000, showing the F/M ratio has improved by 57.44% within the decade. For the middle level of education it was 0.42 in the start of decade and increased to 0.68 by the end of decade, so it has improved almost 62%. In both cases the gender disparity is decreased but relatively more rapidly at middle level.<ref name=TasnimKhan>{{cite web | last =Khan | first =Tasnim |author2=Khan, Rana Ejaz Ali | title =Gender Disparity in Education - Extents, Trends and Factors | publisher =Journal of Research (Faculty of Languages & Islamic Studies) | year =2004 | url =http://bzu.edu.pk/jrlanguages/Vol-5%202004/Tasnim%20Khan%20&%20Rana%20Ejaz-3.pdf | accessdate =2009-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe gender disparity in enrollment at secondary level of education was 0.4 in 1990-91 and 0.67 in 1999-2000, showing that the disparity decreased by 67.5% in the decade. At the college level, it was 0.50 in 1990-91 and reached 0.81 in 1999-2000, showing that the disparity decreased by 64%. The gender disparity has decreased comparatively rapidly at secondary school.<ref name=TasnimKhan/>\n\nThere is great difference in the rates of enrollment of boys, as compared to girls in Pakistan. According to UNESCO figures, primary school enrollment for girls stand at 60 per cent as compared to 84 percent for boys. The secondary school enrollment rate stands at a lower rate of 32 percent for females and 46 per cent males. Regular school attendance for female students is estimated at 41 per cent while that for male students is 50 per cent.<ref name=\"UNESCO Institute for Statistics\"/>\n\nA particularly interesting aspect of this gender disparity is representation of Pakistani [[Women in STEM fields|women in STEMM]] (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine). In 2013, the issue of [[Women in medicine|women doctors]] in Pakistan was highlighted in local and international media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1032070|title=The doctor brides|last=Zakaria|first=Rafia|date=2013-07-26|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}</ref> <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34042751|title=Are Pakistan's female medical students to be doctors or wives?|date=2015-08-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/08/30/pakistan-sees-high-rate-of-female-medical-students-but-few-doctors/|title=Pakistan sees high rate of female medical students, but few doctors|date=2015-08-30|work=Women in the World in Association with The New York Times - WITW|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-house-in-pakistan-quite-possibly-1.305653|title=Is there a doctor in the house?

Shortage of teachers and poorly equipped laboratories have resulted in the out-dated curriculum that has little relevance to present-day needs. The education is based just on cramming and the students lack professional skills as well as communication skills when they are graduated from an institute. Moreover the universities here are too expensive, due to which the Pakistani students can't afford a university to get higher education. Moreover, the universities here don't provide skills that have a demand in market <ref name=\"Rasool Memon 2007 47\u201355\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nSome of the famous [[alumni]] of [[Pakistan]] are as follow:\n[[File:Government College University.jpg|thumb|255x255px|[[Government College University (Lahore)]]]]\n\n===Abdus Salam===\n[[File:UET Department of Electrical Engineering.jpg|thumbnail|[[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]]|191x191px]]\n{{Main article|Abdus Salam}}\n[[Abdus Salam]] was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and [[Nobel laureate in physics]] for his work on the [[electroweak unification]] of the electromagnetic and weak forces.

The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972\u201373 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but it is not going to be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be \"invented\" by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an \"unconventional\" approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can \"invent\" the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Increasing Education Expenditure to 7 percent of GDP in Pakistan: Eyes on the Miracle |newspaper=Business Recorder|location=Islamabad|date=4 July 2010|url=http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?show=&&id=1076881&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate=|accessdate=<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>\n\n==University rankings==\n{{Main article|Rankings of universities in Pakistan}}\nAccording to the Quality Standard World University Ranking for 2014, [[Quaid-e-Azam University|QAU]], [[institute of Space Technology|IST]], [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences|PIEAS]], [[Aga Khan University|AKU]], [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|NUST]], [[Lahore University of Management Sciences|LUMS]], [[COMSATS University Islamabad|CUI]], [[University of Karachi|KU]] and [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|UET Lahore]] are ranked among top 300 universities in [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2014#sorting=rank+region=+country=120+faculty=+stars=false+search= |title=QS University Rankings: Asia 2014 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Religion and education==\n\nEducation in Pakistan is heavily influenced by religion.
