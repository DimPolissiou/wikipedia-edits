She is eventually vindicated, when the slavers send a fleet to lay siege to Meereen. She accompanies Daenerys to a parley with the slavers' representatives. When Daenerys leaves on Drogon to destroy the fleet, Missandei tells the masters that Daenerys has ordered one of their deaths as punishment for their treachery, though when two of them offer up the third Grey Worm kills those two instead.

Later, as the Unsullied prepare to leave for the seizure of Casterly Rock, Missandei goes to Grey Worm to talk about their feelings and the pair consummate their relationship. Missandei eventually reveals her entire backstory to Jon and Davos in an attempt to impress Daenerys' character upon them.\n\n====Season 8====\nMissandei travels with Daenerys' court to Winterfell. Feeling unwelcome amongst the Northerns, she and Grey Worm plan to sail to Naath after Daenerys wins the Iron Throne. During the Long Night, Missandei shelters in the crypts, and survives the Night King's reanimation of the dead Starks in the crypts.

While bathing in a stream she witnesses Grey Worm watching her; although she covers herself, she later admits to Grey Worm that she is glad he saw her. She expresses sorrow that Grey Worm was castrated during his training, though Grey Worm notes that if he had not become an Unsullied soldier he never would have met her.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season 5, Grey Worm is gravely wounded in a skirmish with the Sons of the Harpy, and Missandei stands vigil by his side. When Grey Worm wakes he reveals to her that, in battle, he felt fear for the first time, fear that he would never see Missandei again; Missandei is clearly moved by his sentiment. When the Sons of the Harpy launch an attack at the reopening of the fighting pits, one of the Sons nearly kills Missandei before he is killed by [[Tyrion Lannister]].

Although Missandei helps defend Tyrion's decision to the outraged Meereenese freedman, in private she warns Tyrion that the masters will betray him. She is eventually vindicated, when the slavers send a fleet to lay siege to Meereen. She accompanies Daenerys to a parley with the slavers' representatives. When Daenerys leaves on Drogon to destroy the fleet, Missandei tells the masters that Daenerys has ordered one of their deaths as punishment for their treachery, though when two of them offer up the third Grey Worm kills those two instead. Missandei later accompanies Daenerys and her forces as they sail to Westeros.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3982261 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3982261 |title=Watch: The Show's Writers Go Inside The Season 6 Finale Of 'Game Of Thrones' |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |accessdate=September 8, 2016 |date=June 28, 2016 |author=Snowden, Heather |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Season 7====\nMissandei is present throughout Daenerys's reclamation of her ancestral stronghold of Dragonstone. She presides over [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] and Davos Seaworth's arrival at the island. Davos is quite taken with Missandei and inquires about her background, but she remains mysterious. Later, as the Unsullied prepare to leave for the seizure of Casterly Rock, Missandei goes to Grey Worm to talk about their feelings and the pair consummate their relationship. Missandei eventually reveals her entire backstory to Jon and Davos in an attempt to impress Daenerys' character upon them.\n\n====Season 8====\nMissandei travels with Daenerys' court to Winterfell. Feeling unwelcome amongst the Northerns, she and Grey Worm plan to sail to Naath after Daenerys wins the Iron Throne. During the Long Night, Missandei shelters in the crypts, and survives the Night King's reanimation of the dead Starks in the crypts. After the defeat of the White Walkers, she accompanies Daenerys' forces to Dragonstone, but they are ambushed by Euron Greyjoy's fleet and Missandei is taken prisoner and brought to [[Cersei Lannister]] in King's Landing. Tyrion, Daenerys, and Grey Worm journey to King's Landing and Tyrion begs Cersei to surrender, but Cersei has [[Gregor Clegane]] behead Missandei. Missandei is later avenged by [[Sandor Clegane]], who kills Gregor, though at the cost of his own life.\n\n===Controversy===\nMissandei's death at the end of \"[[The Last of the Starks]]\" was criticized as a plot device to push Daenerys's descent into madness.<ref name=\"RankingDeaths\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/arts/television/season-8-game-of-thrones-deaths.html|title=Ranking the Deaths in the Final 'Game of Thrones' Season|date=May 20, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref> Just before being beheaded by [[Gregor Clegane]] at Cersei's direction, Missandei shouts \"Dracarys!\" at Daenerys, who is standing just outside of the city of King's Landing backed by her army and her last fire-breathing dragon, Drogon.<ref name=RankingDeaths /> \"Dracarys\" is the command used to incite fire from a dragon in the series.<ref name=RankingDeaths /> Although many viewers considered Daenerys's transition into a mad conqueror to be poorly executed by the show's creators, she would go on in the next episode to use Drogon to destroy the city of King's Landing and kill all of its inhabitants<ref name=RankingDeaths /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/5/5/18530451/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-4-daenerys-dracarys-mad-queen |title=Game of Thrones' Mad Queen Theory, Explained|work=Vox |date=May 5, 2019|access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref> Missandei's death was viewed by some as an easy shortcut to Daenerys's improbable flip and the subsequent destruction of King's Landing.\n\nMissandei's death has been considered as a possible example of [[fridging]].<ref name=Tragic>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/missandeis-death-on-game-of-thrones-was-tragic-in-more-ways-than-one-17305617 |title=Missandei's Death On 'Game Of Thrones' Was Tragic In More Ways Than One|work=Bustle |date=May 9, 2019|access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/5590729/game-of-thrones-finale-daenerys/ |title=Game of Thrones Had an Opportunity With Daenerys Targaryen.

Among the earliest uses of \"pseudo-science\" was in an 1844 article in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', issue 387:\n{{quote|text=That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.}}\n\nAn earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[Fran\u00e7ois Magendie]], that refers to [[phrenology]] as \"''a pseudo-science of the present day''\".<ref name=\"Magendie1843\">{{cite book|title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology|vauthors=Magendie F|publisher=Harper|others=John Revere|year=1843|edition=5th|location=New York|page=150|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgkgeQl9wN8C|title=Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem|last=Lamont|first=Peter|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107019331|location=|pages=58|quote=When the eminent French physiologist, Fran\u00e7ois Magendie, first coined the term \u2018pseudo-science\u2019 in 1843, he was referring to phrenology.}}</ref> During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.<!-- <ref name=Still/> --> From time-to-time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.<ref name=Still>{{cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265\u201390 |title=The Social Psychology of \"Pseudoscience\": A Brief History | vauthors = Still A, Dryden W | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to science==\nPseudoscience is differentiated from science because \u2013 although it claims to be science \u2013 pseudoscience does not adhere to accepted scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and [[Mertonian norms]].\n\n===Scientific method===\n{{Main|Scientific method}}\n[[File:The_Scientific_Method_(simple).png|thumb|The scientific method is a continuous cycle of hypothesis, prediction, testing and questioning.]]\n[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th-century [[phrenology]] chart: During the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul.

Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20135 ff}}</ref> These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]<ref>{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, \"Probability\", and Chapter 7, \"inductive Logic and Statistics\"</ref> are also important tools for the scientific method.\n\n===Falsifiability===\n{{Main|Falsifiability}}\nDuring the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.<ref name=\"Popper\">{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).</ref> [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

Some modern pseudosciences, such as [[astrology]] and [[acupuncture]], originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific theory of [[evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greener M | title = Taking on creationism.

The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\">{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it.

Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20135 ff}}</ref> These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]<ref>{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, \"Probability\", and Chapter 7, \"inductive Logic and Statistics\"</ref> are also important tools for the scientific method.\n\n===Falsifiability===\n{{Main|Falsifiability}}\nDuring the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.<ref name=\"Popper\">{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).</ref> [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

This use of the term is common among practitioners of [[post-normal science]].

Some modern pseudosciences, such as [[astrology]] and [[acupuncture]], originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology.

The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.<ref name=Imre-Lakatos/>|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}\n\nThe boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.<ref name=\"Cover_Curd_1998\"/><ref>{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219\u2013225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}\n</ref> The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history.

To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.<ref name=Newbold>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324\u201330 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}</ref>|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|\"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory\" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

It emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself partly of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]) and developed in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref>\n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted. Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint.\n[[File:Shahjahan on globe, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|''The Emperor Shah Jahan standing on a globe'', with a halo and European-style ''[[putti]]'', c.&nbsp;1618-19 to 1629.]]\n\nThe Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India. It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined. These are often described as \"post-Mughal\", \"sub-Mughal\" or \"provincial Mughal\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n==Subjects==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:25 Abu'l Hasan.

This had never been a feature of either [[Persian miniature]] or earlier Indian painting. The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 23-30</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref><ref>Abid.

Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 66</ref> There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 68</ref> Another new type of image showed the [[Jharokha Darshan]] (literally \"balcony view/worship\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb. In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits. Like the increasingly large [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] these emperors were given in single portraits, the [[iconography]] reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of [[Allah]] on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves.<ref>Hansen, Waldemar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA102 ''The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India'', 102, 1986, Motilal Banarsidass] ISBN 978-81-208-0225-4</ref><ref name=Kaur>{{Cite web|last= Kaur \n|first= Manpreet |url=http://www.ijifr.com/pdfsave/01-03-2015778V2-E6-064.pdf|format=pdf|title=\nRomancing The Jharokha: From Being A Source Of Ventilation And Light To The Divine Conception|date= February 2015|publisher=International Journal of Informative & Futuristic Research}}</ref> Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or [[Durbar (court)|in durbar]], or formal council. These and royal portraits incorporated in hunting scenes became highly popular types in later [[Rajput painting]] and other post-Mughal styles.\n\n===Animals and plants===\n[[File:\"Study of a Nilgai (Blue Bull)\", Folio from the Shah Jahan Album MET DT4808.jpg|thumb|[[Nilgai]] by [[Ustad Mansur]] (fl.&nbsp;1590-1624), who specialized in birds and animal studies for albums.]]\nAnother popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; the text of the ''[[Baburnama]]'' includes a number of descriptions of such subjects, which were illustrated in the copies made for Akbar. These subjects also had specialist artists, including [[Ustad Mansur]]. [[Milo C. Beach]] argues that \"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed. Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\". He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.<ref>Beach, 32-37, 37 quoted</ref>\n\n===Illustrated books===\nIn the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], was a ''[[Tutinama]]'' with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures. In contrast the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures. The work was \"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of [[Muhammad]].<ref>Beach, 61</ref> Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond. These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580.\n\nOther large projects included biographies or memoirs of the [[Mughal dynasty]]. [[Babur]], its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each. The ''[[Akbarnama]]'' was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with [[Jahangir]]'s autobiography ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama'') and a celebratory biography of [[Shah Jahan]], called the ''[[Padshahnama]]'', which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650. Akbar commissioned a copy of the ''[[Zafarnama (Yazdi biography)|Zafarnama]]'', a biography of his distant ancestor [[Timur]], but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father [[Humayun]], no illustrated manuscript survives.\n\nVolumes of the classics of [[Persian poetry]] usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions. Four are known of the ''[[Razmnama]]'', a ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617. Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the ''[[Ramayana]]''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0443\u0445 \u0411\u0435\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435. 1589. \u0413\u0430\u043b. \u0421\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|''Babur Receives a Courtier'' by [[Farrukh Beg]] c.&nbsp;1580-85.

Still using the style of [[Persian miniature]].]] \nMughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting. These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious. They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive.\n\nIn contrast Mughal painting was \"almost entirely secular\",<ref>Harle, 372</ref> although religious figures were sometimes portrayed. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], especially in portraits of both people and animals, became a key aim, far more than in Persian painting, let alone the Indian traditions.<ref>Harle, 372</ref> There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate of Delhi]] which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. These paintings were painted on loose-leaf paper, and were usually placed between decorated wooden covers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to [[Timur]] and were fully assimilated into [[Persianate]] culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.\n\nThe style of the Mughal school developed within the royal [[atelier]]. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sensiblereason.com/artistic-stylistic-transmission-in-the-royal-mughal-atelier/|title=Artistic Stylistic Transmission in the Royal Mughal Atelier|first=Greg|last=Sarafan|date=6 November 2011|publisher=Sensible Reason}}</ref> In some cases, senior artists would draw the illustrations in outline, and more junior ones would usually apply the colours, especially for background areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

[[British Museum]]]]\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in [[Kabul]]), an unusually large painting on cloth of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]]. Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century [[Jahangir]] had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 50</ref> When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him. His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.<ref>Grove</ref> Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,<ref>Grove</ref> a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.<ref>Beach, 58</ref>\n\n===Akbar (r. 1556-1605)===\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.<ref>Beach, 49</ref>\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\".<ref>Grove</ref> \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 cotton [[Bookbinding|folio]]s, unusually large at 69&nbsp;cm x 54&nbsp;cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\". By the end, the style reached maturity, and \"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\".<ref>Losty, 15</ref>\n\n[[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570\u20131585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.<ref>Eastman</ref>\n\nAkbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire.\n<ref>Ebba Koch, Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Ebba |title=Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited |journal=Art Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n===Jahangir (1605\u20131625)===\n[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama''), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view.\n\nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.<ref>Britannica</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state.\n\n==Later paintings==\n[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|A [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] scene with the newly crowned Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign.]]\n[[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings. After 1681 he moved to the [[Deccan]] to pursue his slow conquest of the [[Deccan Sultanates]], never returning to live in the north.<ref>Losty, 147, 149</ref>\n\nMughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary] by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]</ref> There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719\u201348), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759\u20131806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence.

Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.<ref>Losty, 31; Crill and Jariwala, 27; Britannica</ref>\n\nThis was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the ''[[Tutinama]]'', ''[[Baburnama]]'', ''[[Hamzanama]]'', ''[[Razmnama]]'', and ''[[Akbarnama]]''. For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work.<ref>Losty, 31</ref> An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}</ref>\n\nConveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature. Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters. For example, the [[Razmnamah (British Library, Or. 12076)|incomplete ''Razmnama'']] in the [[British Library]] contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.<ref>[https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/04/razmnamah-the-persian-mahabharata.html \"Razmnamah: the Persian Mahabharata\"], British Library ''Asian and African studies blog'', by Ursula Sims-Williams, April 2016 - see table near bottom</ref>\n\nOther important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:<ref>Diamind, Maurice.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].\n\n==Mughal style today==\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Painting of Akbar Mughal Period, National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|Portrait of Akbar\nFile:A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.jpg|A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.

It emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself partly of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]) and developed in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> \n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures.  Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted.  Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories.  Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles.  The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint.\n[[File:Shahjahan on globe, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|''The Emperor Shah Jahan standing on a globe'', with a halo and European-style ''[[putti]]'', c.&nbsp;1618-19 to 1629.]]\n\nThe Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India.  It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined.  These are often described as \"post-Mughal\", \"sub-Mughal\" or \"provincial Mughal\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n==Subjects==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:25 Abu'l Hasan.

This had never been a feature of either [[Persian miniature]] or earlier Indian painting.  The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer.  For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture.  Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 23-30</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref><ref>Abid.

Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were.  Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 66</ref> There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries</ref>  \n\nFrom the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 68</ref>  Another new type of image showed the [[Jharokha Darshan]] (literally \"balcony view/worship\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb.  In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits.  Like the increasingly large [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] these emperors were given in single portraits, the [[iconography]] reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of [[Allah]] on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves.<ref>Hansen, Waldemar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA102 ''The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India'', 102, 1986, Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 978-81-208-0225-4</ref><ref name=Kaur>{{Cite web|last= Kaur \n|first= Manpreet |url=http://www.ijifr.com/pdfsave/01-03-2015778V2-E6-064.pdf|format=pdf|title=\nRomancing The Jharokha: From Being A Source Of Ventilation And Light To The Divine Conception|date= February 2015|publisher=International Journal of Informative & Futuristic Research}}</ref>  Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or [[Durbar (court)|in durbar]], or formal council.  These and royal portraits incorporated in hunting scenes became highly popular types in later [[Rajput painting]] and other post-Mughal styles.\n\n===Animals and plants===\n[[File:\"Study of a Nilgai (Blue Bull)\", Folio from the Shah Jahan Album MET DT4808.jpg|thumb|[[Nilgai]] by [[Ustad Mansur]] (fl.&nbsp;1590-1624), who specialized in birds and animal studies for albums.]]\nAnother popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; the text of the ''[[Baburnama]]'' includes a number of descriptions of such subjects, which were illustrated in the copies made for Akbar. These subjects also had specialist artists, including [[Ustad Mansur]].  [[Milo C. Beach]] argues that \"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed.  Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\".  He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.<ref>Beach, 32-37, 37 quoted</ref>\n\n===Illustrated books===\nIn the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], was a ''[[Tutinama]]'' with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures.  In contrast the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures.  The work was \"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of [[Muhammad]].<ref>Beach, 61</ref>  Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond.  These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580.\n\nOther large projects included biographies or memoirs of the [[Mughal dynasty]]. [[Babur]], its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each.  The ''[[Akbarnama]]'' was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with [[Jahangir]]'s autobiography ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama'') and a celebratory biography of [[Shah Jahan]], called the ''[[Padshahnama]]'', which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650.  Akbar commissioned a copy of the ''[[Zafarnama (Yazdi biography)|Zafarnama]]'', a biography of his distant ancestor [[Timur]], but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father [[Humayun]], no illustrated manuscript survives.\n\nVolumes of the classics of [[Persian poetry]] usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions.  Four are known of the ''[[Razmnama]]'', a ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617.  Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the ''[[Ramayana]]''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0443\u0445 \u0411\u0435\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435. 1589. \u0413\u0430\u043b. \u0421\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|''Babur Receives a Courtier'' by [[Farrukh Beg]] c.&nbsp;1580-85.

Still using the style of [[Persian miniature]].]] \nMughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting.  These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious.  They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive.\n\nIn contrast Mughal painting was \"almost entirely secular\",<ref>Harle, 372</ref> although religious figures were sometimes portrayed.

The names of the main figures are noted on their clothes, and the artist shown at bottom. [[British Museum]]]]\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in [[Kabul]]), an unusually large painting on cloth of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]].  Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century [[Jahangir]] had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 50</ref>  When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him.  His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own.  Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.<ref>Grove</ref>  Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,<ref>Grove</ref> a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.<ref>Beach, 58</ref>\n\n===Akbar (r. 1556-1605)===\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.<ref>Beach, 49</ref>\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\".<ref>Grove</ref> \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 cotton [[Bookbinding|folio]]s, unusually large at 69 cm x 54 cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\".  By the end, the style reached maturity, and \"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\".<ref>Losty, 15</ref>    \n\n[[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes.  Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570-1585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.<ref>Eastman</ref> \n\nAkbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire.\n<ref>Ebba Koch, Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Ebba |title=Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited |journal=Art Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n===Jahangir (1605\u201325)===\n[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further.  Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama''), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

The illustrations from the \"Padshanama\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view. \n\nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.<ref>Britannica</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state.\n\n==Later paintings==\n[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|A [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] scene with the newly crowned Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign.]]\n[[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings.  After 1681 he moved to the [[Deccan]] to pursue his slow conquest of the [[Deccan Sultanates]], never returning to live in the north.<ref>Losty, 147, 149</ref>\n\nMughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in.  Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary]  by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]</ref>  There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719\u201348), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759\u20131806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence.  Late Mughal style often shows increased use of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and recession under Western influence.\n\n==Artists==\n[[File:Colophon portrait from the Khamsa of Nizami - BL Or.

Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded.  Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.<ref>Losty, 31; Crill and Jariwala, 27; Britannica</ref>  \n\nThis was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the ''[[Tutinama]]'', ''[[Baburnama]]'', ''[[Hamzanama]]'', ''[[Razmnama]]'', and ''[[Akbarnama]]''.  For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work.<ref>Losty, 31</ref>  An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}</ref>\n\nConveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature.  Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters.  For example the [[Razmnamah (British Library, Or. 12076)|incomplete ''Razmnama'']] in the [[British Library]] contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.<ref>[https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/04/razmnamah-the-persian-mahabharata.html \"Razmnamah: the Persian Mahabharata\"], British Library ''Asian and African studies blog'', by Ursula Sims-Williams, April 2016 - see table near bottom</ref>    \n\nOther important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:<ref>Diamind, Maurice.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].\n\n==Mughal style today==\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Painting of Akbar Mughal Period, National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|Portrait of Akbar\nFile:A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.jpg|A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'\n}}\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n}}* ''[[The Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.
