During his residency in Mount Pleasant, Richards attended school, where he claimed that teachers there considered him well-behaved. At his mother's insistence, he also attended [[Sunday school]] and church regularly.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}\n\nRichards would remain under his parents' roof during this time, working for farmers and other locals in the area.

Also during this time, Richards came in contact with men of questionable occupation, and began passing around [[Counterfeiting of money|counterfeit bills]] that he claimed, had obtained through a man in [[New York City|New York]]. In February 1876, Richards left Mount Pleasant, heading west to \"seek his fortune\".{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=12}}\n\nFor a time, Richards set up residency in [[Iowa]], where he worked around as a farmhand at various local farms in [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]] and [[Morning Sun, Iowa|Morning Sun]]. He was later hired as an attendant at the [[Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute|Iowa Lunatic Asylum]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], where his job was to bury dead patients.

After refusing to return the man's money, Richards claimed that the man grew belligerent, resulting in Richards shooting him above the left eye, killing the man instantly. Confirming that the man was dead, Richards disposed of the body in the nearby river.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}\n\nSeveral days later, while continuing towards Kearney, Richards encountered another stranger who was traveling on foot.

Richards later stated that he waited until the stranger's back was turned, at which point he shot him in the back of the head, killing him. After disposing of the body, he later sold the stranger's horse in a nearby town before continuing on the road to Kearney.

Once Richards had left, the man soon discovered that the cash was counterfeit and tracked Richards down, demanding either good money or the return of his horse and buggy.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=15}} Richards initially refused, whereupon the man threatened to have him arrested. In response, Richards shot the man, burying his corpse before leaving the area.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=16}}\n\nIn March 1877, Richards left [[Grand Island, Nebraska]], on horseback with a young man with the last name of Gemge, heading to Kearney. Near the end of their journey, they camped for the night along the [[Platte River]] between [[Lowell, Nebraska|Lowell]] and Kearney. Richards woke at around 3 a.m. and aroused his partner, telling him that it was almost morning and that they ought to get back on the road; Gemge, infuriated at being woken so early, began arguing with Richards about the time. Richards tried explaining to Gemge that it was in fact 3 a.m., at which point Gemge began insulting him.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=17}} Richards later recounted what followed:\n\n{{Quote|text='It's a good thing you don't mean all you say,' I said.

Mrs. Harlson had been jailed as well, on suspicion of aiding her husband during his escape.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Richards and Mrs. Harlson agreed that she would sell him the deed to her property for $600, six months later.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=19}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}\n\nAfter Richards was released from jail, he traveled around Nebraska for several months, doing business in Hastings, Bloomington and Grand Island, before arriving at the Harlson's Kearney County homestead on October 18, 1878. When Richards arrived, Mrs. Harlson transferred her property to him, and he settled down there for several weeks.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} It was later reported by the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' that Richards had married Mrs. Harlson on November 2, in what they alleged was a scam in order to acquire ownership of Harlson's land.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}  A month later, Richards decided to kill Mrs. Harlson and her three children: ten-year-old Daisy, four-year-old Mabel, and two-year-old Jasper, nicknamed \"Jesse\" (Jasper Harlson was living in Texas at the time).{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} In his confession, Richards claimed that Mrs. Harlson 'talked too much', and had discovered that  he was guilty of murder: \"She would have 'given me away' had I let her live ... and so, knowing what she did, I thought it the safest plan to put her out of the way,\" he said.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}}\n\nOn November 3, 1878, Richards and another man named Brown, who had been staying at the house, got up early in the morning.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} Brown went to feed the horses and do other chores around the farm after Brown had left, Richards found a [[spade]] and dug a hole near the house, he then snuck back into the house and murdered Mrs. Harlson, Daisy, Mabel and Jesse with an [[Axe murder|axe]].{{refn|name=Note3|group=Note|According to one report, Mrs. Harlson, and one of the other children were murdered with a [[Steam iron|smoothing iron]], while the others were physically assaulted.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}}} In Richards' confession, most of the Harlsons died immediately after the first several blows, with the exception of Daisy, whom he claimed had 'writhed in pain for some time' before dying.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|pp=21-22}} After the killings, Richards was said to have scrubbed away the bloodstains on the floor, and on his person, before sitting down for breakfast.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}} Afterward, he carried their bodies out of the house and buried them in the hole that he had made earlier. Later, when he was questioned about the Harlsons disappearance by several people, Richards claimed that they had left with Brown, and did not know when they would return.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} A modern-day account would claim that Richards gave the excuse that Mary and her children had left to be reunited with her husband after she had transferred the deed of the farm to him.{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=1+}} The bodies of Mrs. Harelson and her children were later discovered on December 11, with conflicting reports stating that they had been concealed underneath a haystack,{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}} rather than buried as Richards had later claimed.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}}\n\n===Murder of Peter Anderson===\nIn December 1878, Richards agreed to help his neighbor, a Swedish immigrant named Peter Anderson, with some work on Anderson's property.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} An article for ''The Columbus Journal'', nine days after Anderson's murder, listed a certain Dick Richardson, a possible alias used by Richards while under Anderson's employment, as the one responsible for the murder.{{sfn|ColumbusJournal|1878|p=2}} On December 9,{{sfn|SiousCityJournal|1879|p=2}}{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=11}} Anderson became ill after eating a meal Richards had prepared, causing him to suspect Richards had poisoned him.

However, a group of Anderson's neighbors approached Richards that evening in order to inquire about Anderson, whom they had not seen in a while. Arriving at the house, the group discovered Richards hitching up Anderson's horses, and when questioned about Anderson's whereabouts Richards reportedly distracted the group, claiming that Anderson was inside. As the neighbors entered the house, Richards fled the scene on horseback to [[Bloomington, Nebraska|Bloomington]].{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}}\n\nFleeing the area, Richards traveled east, alternating between horse, train, and foot, passing through Omaha, Chicago, (an article from the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'' alternately claimed that Richards, under the alias Samuel Richards, had instead fled to [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]] after the murder through Hastings, Chicago).{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} While on the run, he met up with Jasper Harlson, the ex-husband of Mrs. Harlson, and Underwood, traveling with them through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Bridgeport, Ohio]] before reaching his hometown of [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]].{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYTimes|1879|p=2}} Nebraska state Governor [[Silas Garber]] issued an arrest warrant for Richards on December 16, 1878, with the reward of $200 (about $5,173.56 in 2020) for his arrest and conviction.{{sfn|NSHistoricalSociety|1942|p=501}}\n\n===Capture===\nThe circumstances and location of Richards' eventual arrest have varied somewhat, with some newspaper records around that time reporting that Richards was arrested shortly after his arrival in Mount Pleasant.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}} ''[[The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer]]'' reported that, upon arriving in a town near Mount Pleasant, Richards was subsequently identified by an old acquaintance, who detained him with the help of a colleague.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} Most records at the time have listed the date of Richards' arrest as being December 24, 1878.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Though one contemporary source has claimed that Richards was arrested in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1879,{{sfn|Ramsland|2006|p=4}}\n\nRichards himself would later claim to have nearly evaded capture in Ohio, stating that he had intended to travel back to Nebraska, as he reasoned it would have been the last place anyone would have bothered to look. Richards also reported a different story of the circumstances of his arrest. In his account, sometime after arriving in his hometown in Jefferson County, he had attended a [[ballroom dance]] with two unidentified women. While strolling just outside of town, with the women in attendance, he claimed to have spotted what appeared to be several officers approaching him.

In his final words, Richards launched into an impassioned defense for his actions, again claiming that Anderson's death was in self-defense, while also claiming that he had nothing to do with the murder of the Harlson family. Richards then stated that he \"had faith in Christ\", and pleaded with the crowd to sing with him the hymn ''[[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]]''.

In 1876, Richards left his home in Mount Pleasant, heading Westward with the intention of 'seeking his fortune'. For a time, Richards found work at a local [[Sanatorium|asylum]], where he claimed to have lost all empathy towards others during his time there. In his later confessions, Richards claimed to have committed his first murder sometime in late 1876, two weeks after arriving in [[Kearney, Nebraska]]. After committing several other murders, in which he claimed was [[Murder in self defense|self-defense]], Richards later fled after the murder of the Harlson family, eventually being captured in his home town of Mount Pleasant. He was later tried and hanged in 1879, for the murder of Mrs. Harlson and her three children, and for the murder of his neighbor Peter Anderson.\n\nRichards later became known through an [[biography]], which was based on an interview conducted during his final arrest. The biography, which also included entries on other criminals of the time, was published [[posthumously]] in 1879, by the ''[[Nebraska State Journal]]''. Richards was later featured in an episode of [[SyFy Channel]]'s ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'', where his spirit was purported to have tormented a family.\n\n==Early and young adult life==\nStephen Dee Richards was born in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]],{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}}{{refn|name=Note1|group=Note|In a biography published shortly after his execution, its author claimed that Richards was born in Ohio.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}}} on March 18, 1856.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} At the age of six, Richards moved with his family out of state to [[Ohio]], first settling in [[Monroe County, Ohio|Monroe county]], before later moving on to [[Noble County, Ohio|Noble County]].{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} At the age of eleven, his family moved once again, settling in the [[Quakers|Quaker]] village of [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]]. Richards later described his mother as being a devout [[Methodist]], while claiming his father, a farmer,{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|BelmontChronicle|1879|p=2}} \"made no profession of religion\". During his residency in Mount Pleasant, Richards attended school, where he claimed that teachers there considered him well-behaved. At his mother's insistence, he also attended [[Sunday school]] and church regularly.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} \n\nRichards would remain under his parents' roof during this time, working for farmers and other locals in the area. On September 16, 1871, Richards' mother passed away from unknown causes.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=11}}{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} Several years later, the age of 20, Richards met and became engaged to a young woman named Anna Millhorne, whom he kept regular correspondence with during his later travels up until his final arrest.  Also during this time, Richards came in contact with men of questionable occupation, and began passing around [[Counterfeiting of money|counterfeit bills]] that he claimed, had obtained through a man in [[New York City|New York]]. In February 1876, Richards left Mount Pleasant, heading west to \"seek his fortune\".{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=12}}\n\nFor a time, Richards set up residency in [[Iowa]], where he worked around as a farmhand at various local farms in [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]] and [[Morning Sun, Iowa|Morning Sun]]. He was later hired as an attendant at the [[Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute|Iowa Lunatic Asylum]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], where his job was to bury dead patients.

According to his account, Richards met another man while traveling on horseback through the Nebraska countryside, and the pair soon decided to camp out for the night near [[Dobytown, Nebraska|Dobytown]],{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}} though several newspaper records have alternately reported that Richards had camped near [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills]].{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}{{sfn|StateJournal|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}}  Settling down for the night, the two began gambling in a game of cards, with Richards winning most of the stranger's money. The following morning, as the two set off for Kearney, the stranger turned on Richards, demanding his money back. After refusing to return the man's money, Richards claimed that the man grew belligerent, resulting in Richards shooting him above the left eye, killing the man instantly. Confirming that the man was dead, Richards disposed of the body in the nearby river.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}\n\nSeveral days later, while continuing towards Kearney, Richards encountered another stranger who was traveling on foot. The man told Richards that he had seen him in company with the stranger he had killed several days earlier and asked what had become of him;{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}{{refn|name=Note2|group=Note|In his confession, Richards stated that the stranger had identified the murdered man as being named John, although he later admitted that he was unable to find out the man's last name.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}}}} in the course of the conversation, he realized that the two men were friends and business partners. Although he denied any knowledge of the other man, the stranger continued to hound Richards with questions.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}} Growing increasingly nervous from the stranger's interrogatory questions, Richards decided to kill the man to stop him from talking. Richards later stated that he waited until the stranger's back was turned, at which point he shot him in the back of the head, killing him. After disposing of the body, he later sold the stranger's horse in a nearby town before continuing on the road to Kearney. Before arriving at Kerney, Richards later stopped at the home of Jasper Harleson.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}} Jasper's wife Mary,{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}} whom Richards described as being a \"free talker\", had noticed that his shirt was stained with blood and had asked him if he had been in a fight. Not realizing this, Richards jokingly replied that it must have come from the men he murdered, which ended the conversation.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}}\nTraveling to [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], Richards used [[counterfeit money]] to purchase a horse and buggy from an unnamed man. Once Richards had left, the man soon discovered that the cash was counterfeit and tracked Richards down, demanding either good money or the return of his horse and buggy.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=15}} Richards initially refused, whereupon the man threatened to have him arrested. In response, Richards shot the man, burying his corpse before leaving the area.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=16}}\n\nIn March 1877, Richards left [[Grand Island, Nebraska]], on horseback with a young man with the last name of Gemge, heading to Kearney. Near the end of their journey, they camped for the night along the [[Platte River]] between [[Lowell, Nebraska|Lowell]] and Kearney. Richards woke at around 3 a.m. and aroused his partner, telling him that it was almost morning and that they ought to get back on the road; Gemge, infuriated at being woken so early, began arguing with Richards about the time. Richards tried explaining to Gemge that it was in fact 3 a.m., at which point Gemge began insulting him.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=17}} Richards later recounted what followed:\n\n{{Quote|text='It's a good thing you don't mean all you say,' I said. 'But I do mean it,\" he said. \"You don't want to mean it,' I said; and he picked up his revolver and saying, 'Here is something that backs all that I say,' cocked it. I looked at him, and thought, 'The fool acts as if he means to shoot,' and skipping out my little 33 I plugged him one in the head.

Jasper and another prisoner named Underwood had previously escaped from the Kearney jail, shortly before Richards\u2019 arrival. Mrs. Harlson had been jailed as well, on suspicion of aiding her husband during his escape.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Richards and Mrs. Harlson agreed that she would sell him the deed to her property for $600, six months later.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=19}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}\n\nAfter Richards was released from jail, he traveled around Nebraska for several months, doing business in Hastings, Bloomington and Grand Island, before arriving at the Harlson's Kearney County homestead on October 18, 1878. When Richards arrived, Mrs. Harlson transferred her property to him, and he settled down there for several weeks.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} It was later reported by the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' that Richards had married Mrs. Harlson on November 2nd, in what they alleged was a scam in order to acquire ownership of Harlson's land.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}  A month later, Richards decided to kill Mrs. Harlson and her three children: ten-year-old Daisy, four-year-old Mabel, and two-year-old Jasper, nicknamed \"Jesse\" (Jasper Harlson was living in Texas at the time).{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} In his confession, Richards claimed that Mrs. Harlson 'talked too much', and had discovered that  he was guilty of murder: \"She would have 'given me away' had I let her live ... and so, knowing what she did, I thought it the safest plan to put her out of the way,\" he said.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}}\n\nOn November 3, 1878, Richards and another man named Brown, who had been staying at the house, got up early in the morning.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} Brown went to feed the horses and do other chores around the farm after Brown had left, Richards found a [[spade]] and dug a hole near the house, he then snuck back into the house and murdered Mrs. Harlson, Daisy, Mabel and Jesse with an [[Axe murder|axe]].{{refn|name=Note3|group=Note|According to one report, Mrs. Harlson, and one of the other children were murdered with a [[Steam iron|smoothing iron]], while the others were physically assaulted.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}}} In Richards' confession, most of the Harlsons died immediately after the first several blows, with the exception of Daisy, whom he claimed had 'writhed in pain for some time' before dying.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|pp=21-22}} After the killings, Richards was said to have scrubbed away the bloodstains on the floor, and on his person, before sitting down for breakfast.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}} Afterward, he carried their bodies out of the house and buried them in the hole that he had made earlier. Later, when he was questioned about the Harlsons disappearance by several people, Richards claimed that they had left with Brown, and did not know when they would return.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} A modern day account would claim that Richards gave the excuse that Mary and her children had left to be reunited with her husband after she had transfered the deed of the farm to him.{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=1+}} The bodies of Mrs. Harelson and her children were later discovered on December 11, with conflicting reports stating that they had been concealed underneath a haystack,{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}} rather than buried as Richards had later claimed.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}}\n\n===Murder of Peter Anderson===\nIn December 1878, Richards agreed to help his neighbor, a Swedish immigrant named Peter Anderson, with some work on Anderson's property.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} An article for ''The Columbus Journal'', nine days after Anderson's murder, listed a certain Dick Richardson, a possible alias used by Richards while under Anderson's employment, as the one responcible for the murder.{{sfn|ColumbusJournal|1878|p=2}} On December 9th,{{sfn|SiousCityJournal|1879|p=2}}{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=11}} Anderson became ill after eating a meal Richards had prepared, causing him to suspect Richards had poisoned him.

However, a group of Anderson's neighbors approached Richards that evening in order to inquire about Anderson, whom they had not seen in a while. Arriving at the house, the group discovered Richards hitching up Anderson's horses, and when questioned about Anderson's whereabouts Richards reportedly distracted the group, claiming that Anderson was inside. As the neighbors entered the house, Richards fled the scene on horseback to [[Bloomington, Nebraska|Bloomington]].{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}}\n\nFleeing the area, Richards traveled east, alternating between horse, train, and foot, passing through Omaha, Chicago, (an article from the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'' alternately claimed that Richards, under the alias Samuel Richards, had instead fled to [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]] after the murder through Hastings, Chicago).{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} While on the run, he met up with Jasper Harlson, the ex-husband of Mrs. Harlson, and Underwood, traveling with them through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Bridgeport, Ohio]] before reaching his hometown of [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]].{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYTimes|1879|p=2}} Nebraska state Governor [[Silas Garber]] issued an arrest warrant for Richards on December 16, 1878, with the reward of $200 (about $5,173.56 in 2020) for his arrest and conviction.{{sfn|NSHistoricalSociety|1942|p=501}}\n\n===Capture===\nThe circumstances and location of Richards' eventual arrest have varied somewhat, with some newspaper records around that time reporting that Richards was arrested shortly after his arrival in Mount Pleasant.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}} ''[[The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer]]'' reported that, upon arriving in a town near Mount Pleasant, Richards was subsequently identified by an old acquaintance, who detained him with the help of a colleague.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} Most records at the time have listed the date of Richards' arrest as being December 24, 1878.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Though one contemporary source has claimed that Richards was arrested in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1879,{{sfn|Ramsland|2006|p=4}}  \n\nRichards himself would later claim to have nearly evaded capture in Ohio, stating that he had intended to travel back to Nebraska, as he reasoned it would have been the last place anyone would have bothered to look. Richards also reported a different story of the circumstances of his arrest. In his account, sometime after arriving in his hometown in Jefferson County, he had attended a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dance]] with two unidentified women. While strolling just outside of town, with the women in attendance, he claimed to have spotted what appeared to be several officers approaching him. Wanting to fight his way out, Richards told his companions to head back to town to which they refused, and as the officers confronted them, Richards surrendered.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}} Richards would later state that, if the women had left, he would not have been arrested:{{sfn|NYTimes|1879|p=2}}\n\n{{Quote|text=\"If I hadn't had the two girls with me, I guess the constable, McGrew, who arrested me, would have been a dead man - either of us would, for I'd have shot.\"}}\n\nAfter his arrest, Ohio authorities jailed him in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], where he wrote two articles for the local newspaper, confessing to a total of nine murders{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}}{{refn|name=Note4|group=Note|Some newspaper accounts have alternately reported that Richards had confessed to six murders, rather than nine.{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}}{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}}}} over a period of three years.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Sheriff David Anderson of [[Buffalo County, Nebraska|Buffalo County]] and Sheriff Martin of [[Kearney County, Nebraska|Kearney County]],{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYTimes|1879|p=2}} (an alternate record listed both Anderson and a Simon C.

As a result, authorities came to the decision that Richards was not to be transferred into any of those areas.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}} Shortly before his trial, Richards voiced his suspicions that he would be convicted and hanged for his crimes.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}} \n\n==Trial==\nRichards' trial began on January 16, 1879, in [[Minden, Nebraska]], with Judge Gaslin presiding over the court proceedings. With the charges of [[murder in the first degree]], Richards pled [[Not guilty plea|not guilty]], arguing  that Anderson's murder was in self-defense, and therefore justifiable.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} After two hours of deliberation,{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} Richards was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging,{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} with the date for his execution set for April 26th, later that year.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}}\n\n===Execution===\nUpon his return to Nebraska, The ''Omaha Herald'' reported: \"Richards manifested supreme indifference to his lot, was perfectly willing to be brought direct to Kearney Junction and said he had as soon died one way as another.\"{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}} Shortly after Richards' trial, Sheriff Martin announced that the execution would be open to the public, though he was afraid that the large crowd of onlookers would be roused to violence.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879a|p=4}} Stephen Dee Richards was hanged in Minden on April 26,{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} 1879.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=399}} A crowd of approximately 25,000 was said to be in attendance to witness the hanging, and, at precisely 1 pm, Richards was led to the gallows by Sheriff Martin and his deputy. In his final words, Richards launched into an impassioned defense for his actions, again claiming that Anderson's death was in self-defense, while also claiming that he had nothing to do with the murder of the Harlson family. Richards then stated that he \"had faith in Christ\", and pleaded with the crowd to sing with him the hymn ''[[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]]''. At precisely 1:17 pm, Richards was hanged from the gallows, with the attending reporter for the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' stating that it took fifteen minutes for the criminal to die.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} \n\nAfterwards, his body was buried in a nearby grave,{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} which was later dug up and his bones scattered in the streets of Kearney.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} In 1882, it was reported that ''Kearney County Gazette'' had obtained Richards' skull and had placed it on display,{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} the current location of the skull remains unknown.\n\n==Pathology==\n{{Quote box|width= 40%|align=right|quote=\"I have killed nine persons, and I can't say I feel any worse for it.\"{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}|source = Richards, describing his lack of guilt over his crimes}}\n\nAt the time of Richards' killing spree and execution, [[criminal psychology]] and [[Criminal profiling|profiling]] had not yet become a recognized field of study, having first been utilized during the [[Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper murders]] in 1888, nine years after Richards' execution.{{sfn|Bonn|2017}} Richards was observed by many to have displayed a complete lack of remorse towards his crimes, after his arrest.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} An article in the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' reported of Richards' mood after his capture as being 'carefree and cheerful'.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}} Members of the press that interviewed Richards after his arrest were struck by his calm and collected behavior.{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|BelmontChronicle|1879|p=2}}{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}} During an interview with a reporter from the ''Wheeling Daily Intelligencer'', Richards himself stated that he knew that he would be executed for his crimes, but also stated that he was unafraid of death and was \"ready to meet it\".{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=1}} When his death sentence was announced by the jury, Richards mood was said to have been cheerful after the verdict.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} In a report for the ''St. Louis Globe-Democrat'', who also expressed doubt over the number of murders Richards claimed to have committed, was said to have broken down during his final moments.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} \n\nConsidered reasonably handsome by observers, Richards was described by reporters at the time of his arrest as being \"heavily built\", standing approximately six feet tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}}\n\n==Legacy==\nBefore his execution in 1879, Richards was interviewed by the Nebraska [[State Journal]].

{"title_page": "Line engraving", "text_new": "{{short description|Engraved images printed on paper}}\n[[File:Walt Whitman, steel engraving, July 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Steel engraving]] of [[Walt Whitman]], reproducing a photograph, the frontispiece of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', 1854]] \n'''Line engraving''' is a term for [[engraving|engraved]] images printed on paper to be used as [[Old master print|prints]] or illustrations. The term is mainly used in connection with 18th or 19th century commercial illustrations for [[magazine]]s and books or reproductions of [[painting]]s. It is not a technical term in [[printmaking]], and can cover a variety of techniques, giving similar results. \n\n[[Steel engraving]] is an overlapping term, for images that in fact are often mainly in [[etching]], mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and decorative prints, often reproductive, from about 1820 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less used.  ''Copperplate engraving'' is another somewhat outdated term for engravings. With [[photography]] long established, engravings made today are nearly all artistic ones in [[printmaking]], but the technique is not as common as it used to be; more than other printmaking techniques, engraving requires great skill and much practice, even for an experienced artist.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Engraving}}\nEngraving for the purpose of printmaking creates plates for [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing. Intaglio engravings are made by carving into a plate of a hard substance such as copper, zinc, steel, or plastic. Afterward ink is rubbed into the carved areas and away from the flat surface. Moistened paper is placed over the plate and both are run through the rollers of an intaglio press. The pressure exerted by the press on the paper pushes it into the engraved lines and prints the image made by those lines. In an intaglio print, the engraved lines print black.\n\n[[Wood engraving]] is a [[relief printing]] technique, with the images made by carving into fine-grained hardwood blocks. Ink is rolled onto the surface of the block, dry paper is placed on top of the block and it is printed either by rolling both through a press, or, by hand, using a baren to rub the ink from the surface of the block onto the paper. In a relief print, the engraved lines show white.\n\n==Early history==\nThe art of engraving has been practiced from the earliest ages. The prehistoric [[Aztec]] hatchet given to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in [[Mexico]] was just as truly engraved as a modern copper-plate which may convey a design by [[John Flaxman]]; the Aztec engraving may be less sophisticated than the European, but it is the same art form. Jewelry and many types of fine metal works frequently are engraved as well as furniture. Engraving often is used as an embellishment of knives, swords, guns, and rifles.\n\n===Niellos===\nThe important discovery which made line engraving one of the multiplying arts was the accidental discovery of how to print an [[Cutting|incised]] line. This method was known for some time before its real utility was realized. The [[goldsmith]]s of [[Florence]] in the middle of the 15th century ornamented their works by means of engraving, after which they filled up the hollows produced by the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] with a black [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]-like substance made of [[silver]], [[lead]], and [[sulfur]]. The resulting design, called a ''[[niello]]'', was much higher in [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] and thus, much more visible.\n\nAs this enamel was difficult to remove, goldsmiths developed alternate means of viewing their work while still in progress. They would take a sulfur cast of the work on a matrix of fine [[clay]], and fill up the lines in the sulfur with [[lampblack]], producing the desired high-contrast image.\n\n===Beginnings of European printmaking===\n{{Main|Old master print}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Norblin Ecce Homo 01.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Norblin Ecce Homo 02.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ecce Homo'', ca. 1780, by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]].<br />Etched copperplate (left), and [[Printmaking|print]] obtained as the impression (right). [[National Museum in Warsaw]].\n}}\nIt was discovered later that a [[Artist's proof|proof]] could be taken on damped [[paper]] by filling the engraved lines with [[ink]] and wiping it off the surface of the plate. Pressure was then applied to push the paper into the hollowed lines and draw the ink out of them. This was the beginning of plate printing.\n\nThis convenient way of proofing a niello saved the effort of producing a cast, but further implications went unexplored. Although goldsmiths continued to engrave nielli to ornament [[Plate (dishware)|plate]]s and [[furniture]], it was not until the late 15th century that the new method of printing was implemented.\n\n===Early style===\nIn early [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] prints, the line is used with such perfect simplicity of purpose that the methods of the artists are as obvious as if we saw them actually at work. In all these figures the [[Outline drawing|outline]] is the primary focus, followed by the lines which mark the leading folds of the [[drapery]]. These are always engravers' lines, such as may be made naturally with the burin, and they never imitate the freer line of the pencil or etching needle.\n\n[[Shading]] is used in the greatest moderation with thin straight strokes that never overpower the stronger organic lines of the design. In early metal engraving the shading lines are often [[cross-hatch]]ed. In the earliest woodcuts they are not. The reason being that when lines are incised, they may as easily be crossed, as not. Whereas when they are reserved, the crossing involves much non-artistic labor.\n\n====Italy====\nThe early style of Italian engravers differs greatly from that of a modern [[chiaroscuro|chiaroscurist]]. [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], for example, did not draw and shade at the same time. He got his outlines and the patterns on his dresses all very accurate initially. Then he added a veil of shading with all the lines being straight and all the shading diagonal. This is the primitive method, its peculiarities being due to a combination of natural genius with technical inexperience.\n\n[[File:Pietro Aretino p.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of an engraving by Marcantonio]]<nowiki> </nowiki>[[Marcantonio]], the engraver trained by [[Raphael]], first practiced by copying German woodcuts into line engravings. Marcantonio became an engraver of remarkable power and through him, the pure art of line-engraving reached its maturity. He retained much of the simple early Italian manner in his backgrounds. His figures are modeled boldly in curved lines, crossing each other in the darker shades, but left single in the passages from dark to light and breaking away in fine dots as they approach the light itself, which is of pure white paper. A new Italian school of engraving was born, which put aside minute details for a broad, harmonious treatment.\n\n====Germany====\nThe characteristics of early metal engraving in Germany are demonstrated in the works of [[Martin Schongauer]] (d. 1488) and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (d. 1528). Schongauer used outline and shade as a unified element, and the shading, generally in curved lines. His skill is far more masterly than the straight shading of Mantegna. D\u00fcrer continued Schongauer's curved shading, with increasing manual delicacy and skill, and over-loaded his plates with quantities of living and inanimate objects. He applied the same intensity of study to every art form he explored.\n\n[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and the engravers he employed, made marked technical developments in the field of engraving. Instead of his finished paintings, Rubens provided his engravers with drawings as guides, allowing them to discard the Italian outline method and in its place substitute [[Physical model|modeling]]. They substituted broad masses for the minutely-finished detail of the northern schools, and adopted a system of a dark and light characteristic of engraving, which reportedly Rubens stated, rendered the detail as more harmonious.\n\n==A flourishing art form: 17th and 18th centuries==\n[[File:Detail of a stipple engaving by Francesco Bartolozzi.jpg|thumb|200px|An example of '''stipple engraving''', using tiny dots to create soft tonal effects, by [[Francesco Bartolozzi]]]]\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, line engraving made no new development. Instead, it flourished around the established techniques and principles. [[England|English]] and [[France|French]] artists began to use the technique, with the English learning primarily from the Germans (led by Rubens), and the French from the Italians (Raphael). There was, however, a good deal of cross-influence among all involved traditions.\n\n[[Sir Robert Strange]], as many other English engravers, made it his study to soften and lose the outline, specifically in figure-engraving. Meanwhile, [[Gerard Audran]] (d. 1703) led the [[Renaissance]] school in perfecting the art of modeling with the burin.\n\n==A technological foe: the 19th century==\nIn the 19th century, line engraving was both helped and hindered. Help came from the growth of public [[wealth]], increasing interest in art, and the increase in the [[commerce]] of art\u2014as exemplified by the career of such art dealers as [[Ernest Gambart]]\u2014and the growing demand for [[illustrated]] books. Hindrance to line engraving came from the desire for cheaper and more rapid methods \u2013 a desire satisfied in various ways, but especially, by [[etching]] and various kinds of [[photography]].\n\n[[File:Daniel Webster Duyckinick portrait.jpg|thumb|right|An engraved portrait of [[Daniel Webster]] by Duyckinick, 1873]]\nThe history of the art of line engraving during the last quarter of the 19th century, is one of continued decay. It was hoped that technical improvements might save the art, but by the beginning of the 20th century, pictorial line engraving in England was practically non-existent. The disappearance of the art is due to the fact that the public refused to wait for several years for proofs (some important proofs took as long as 12 years to create) when they could obtain their plates more quickly by other methods. The invention of steel-facing S copper plate enabled the engraver to proceed more quickly; but even in this case he can no more compete with the etcher than the [[mezzotint]] engraver can keep pace with the [[photogravure]] manufacturer.\n\nLine-engraving flourished in [[France]] until the early 20th century, only through official encouragement and intelligent fostering by collectors and [[connoisseur]]s. The class of the work has entirely changed, however, partly through the reduction of prices paid for it, partly through the change of taste and fashion, and partly, again, through the necessities of the situation. French engravers were driven to simplify their work in order to satisfy public impatience. To compensate for loss of color, the art developed in the direction of elegance and refinement.\n\nIn [[Italy]], line engraving decayed just as it had in England, and outside [[Europe]], line engraving seems almost nonexistent. Here and there a spasmodic attempt may be made to appeal to the artistic appreciation of a limited public, but generally, no attention is paid to these efforts. There are still a few who can engrave a head from a photograph or drawing, or a small engraving for book illustration or for book plates; there are more who are highly proficient in [[mechanical engraving]] for decorative purposes, but the engraving-machine is quickly superseding this class.\n\n===Style===\nNineteenth century line engraving, compared with previous work, had a more thorough and delicate rendering of [[local color (visual art)|local color]], [[light]] and [[shading|shade]], and [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]]. Older engravers could draw just as correctly, but they either neglected these elements or admitted them sparingly, as opposed to the spirit of their art, but there is a certain sameness in pure line engraving that is more favorable to some forms and textures than to others.\n\nIn the well-known prints from [[Rosa Bonheur]], for example, the tone of the skies is achieved by machine-ruling, as is much undertone in the landscape. The fur of the animals is all etched, as are the foreground plants; the real burin work is used sparingly where most favorable to texture. Even in the exquisite engravings after [[J. M. W. Turner]], which reached a degree of delicacy in light and shade far surpassing the work of the old masters, the engravers had recourse to etching, finishing with the burin and dry point. Considered as important an influence upon engraving as Raphael and Rubens, Turner contributed much to the field in the direction of delicacy of tone.\n\nThe new French school of engraving had several distinctive characteristics, including the substitution of exquisite greys for the rich blacks of old and, simplicity of method coupled with extremely high elaboration. Their object is, as always, to secure the faithful transcript of the painter they reproduce while readily sacrificing the power of the old method, which, whatever its force and beauty, was easily acquired by mediocre artists of technical ability. The Belgian school of engraving elaborated an effective \"mixed method\" of graver-work and dry-point. The [[Stauffer-Bern]] method of using many fine lines to create tone had a certain advantage in modeling.\n\n==Modern and contemporary art==\nAlthough dwindled to a rarity, modern engravers continue to practice in the art world, most prominently [[Andrew Raftery]]. His choice of subjects is comparable to [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], and his style the French school of elegant and geometrical form.<ref>Hirsch, Faye. [http://artinprint.org/article/art-at-the-threshold-an-inch-in-andrew-rafterys-open-house/ \"Art at the Threshold: An Inch in Andrew Raftery's <i>Open House</i>,] <i>Art in Print</i> Vol. 5 No. 5 (January-February 2016).</ref>\n\n==Tools of the trade==\nThe most important of the tools used in line-engraving is the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], or graver, a bar of steel with one end fixed in a handle, somewhat resembling a [[mushroom]] with one side cut away. The burin is shaped so that the sharpened, cutting end takes the form of a [[lozenge]], and points downward. The burin acts exactly as a [[plough]] in the earth: it makes a [[furrow]] and turns out a shaving of metal in the same way a plough turns the soil of a field. The burin, unlike a plough, is ''pushed'' through the material. This particular characteristic at once establishes a wide separation between it, and all the other instruments employed in the arts of design, such as [[pencil]]s, [[brush]]es, [[pen]]s, and [[etching]] needles.\n\n===Example of burin engraving===\nThe elements of engraving with the burin are evident in the engraving of letters, specifically, the capital letter [[B]]. This letter consists of two perpendicular straight lines and four distinct curves. The engraver scratches these lines, reversed, very lightly with a sharp point or [[stylus]]. Next, the engraver cuts out the blacks (not the whites, as in wood engraving) with two different burins. First, the vertical black line is ploughed with the burin between the two scratched lines, then similarly, some material is removed from the thickest parts of the two curves. Finally, the gradations from the thick middle of the curve to the thin points touching the vertical are worked out with a finer burin.\n\nThe hollows are then filled with printing [[ink]], the surplus ink is wiped from the smooth surface of the metal, damped paper is laid upon the surface and driven into the hollowed letter by the pressure of a revolving cylinder. The paper draws out the ink, and the letter B is printed in intense black.\n\nWhen the surface of a metal plate is sufficiently polished to be used for engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black line. An engraved plate from which visiting cards are printed is a good example of some elementary principles of engraving. It contains thin lines and thick ones, as well as a considerable variety of curves. An elaborate line engraving, if it is a pure line engraving and nothing else, will contain only these simple elements in different combinations. The real line engraver is always engraving a line more or less broad and deep in one direction or another; he has no other business than this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Engraving]]\n*[[Old master print]]\n*[[Printmaking]]\n*[[Steel engraving]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite EB1911 |volume=16 |pages=721\u2013724 |wstitle=Line Engraving}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bodkinprints.co.uk/links.php Comprehensive Links to online images of prints, and other information.]\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures], an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on line engraving\n\n[[Category:Engraving]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Walt Whitman, steel engraving, July 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Steel engraving]] of [[Walt Whitman]], reproducing a photograph, the frontispiece of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', 1854]] \n'''Line engraving''' is a term for [[engraving|engraved]] images printed on paper to be used as [[Old master print|prints]] or illustrations.

Older engravers could draw just as correctly, but they either neglected these elements or admitted them sparingly, as opposed to the spirit of their art, but there is a certain sameness in pure line engraving that is more favorable to some forms and textures than to others.\n\nIn the well-known prints from [[Rosa Bonheur]], for example, the tone of the skies is achieved by machine-ruling, as is much undertone in the landscape. The fur of the animals is all etched, as are the foreground plants; the real burin work is used sparingly where most favorable to texture. Even in the exquisite engravings after [[J. M. W. Turner]], which reached a degree of delicacy in light and shade far surpassing the work of the old masters, the engravers had recourse to etching, finishing with the burin and dry point. Considered as important an influence upon engraving as Raphael and Rubens, Turner contributed much to the field in the direction of delicacy of tone.\n\nThe new French school of engraving had several distinctive characteristics, including the substitution of exquisite greys for the rich blacks of old and, simplicity of method coupled with extremely high elaboration. Their object is, as always, to secure the faithful transcript of the painter they reproduce while readily sacrificing the power of the old method, which, whatever its force and beauty, was easily acquired by mediocre artists of technical ability. The Belgian school of engraving elaborated an effective \"mixed method\" of graver-work and dry-point. The [[Stauffer-Bern]] method of using many fine lines to create tone had a certain advantage in modeling.\n\n==Modern and contemporary art==\nAlthough dwindled to a rarity, modern engravers continue to practice in the art world, most prominently [[Andrew Raftery]]. His choice of subjects is comparable to [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], and his style the French school of elegant and geometrical form.<ref>Hirsch, Faye. [http://artinprint.org/article/art-at-the-threshold-an-inch-in-andrew-rafterys-open-house/ \"Art at the Threshold: An Inch in Andrew Raftery's <i>Open House</i>,] <i>Art in Print</i> Vol. 5 No. 5 (January-February 2016).</ref>\n\n==Tools of the trade==\nThe most important of the tools used in line-engraving is the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], or graver, a bar of steel with one end fixed in a handle, somewhat resembling a [[mushroom]] with one side cut away. The burin is shaped so that the sharpened, cutting end takes the form of a [[lozenge]], and points downward. The burin acts exactly as a [[plough]] in the earth: it makes a [[furrow]] and turns out a shaving of metal in the same way a plough turns the soil of a field. The burin, unlike a plough, is ''pushed'' through the material. This particular characteristic at once establishes a wide separation between it, and all the other instruments employed in the arts of design, such as [[pencil]]s, [[brush]]es, [[pen]]s, and [[etching]] needles.\n\n===Example of burin engraving===\nThe elements of engraving with the burin are evident in the engraving of letters, specifically, the capital letter [[B]]. This letter consists of two perpendicular straight lines and four distinct curves. The engraver scratches these lines, reversed, very lightly with a sharp point or [[stylus]]. Next, the engraver cuts out the blacks (not the whites, as in wood engraving) with two different burins. First, the vertical black line is ploughed with the burin between the two scratched lines, then similarly, some material is removed from the thickest parts of the two curves. Finally, the gradations from the thick middle of the curve to the thin points touching the vertical are worked out with a finer burin.\n\nThe hollows are then filled with printing [[ink]], the surplus ink is wiped from the smooth surface of the metal, damped paper is laid upon the surface and driven into the hollowed letter by the pressure of a revolving cylinder. The paper draws out the ink, and the letter B is printed in intense black.\n\nWhen the surface of a metal plate is sufficiently polished to be used for engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black line. An engraved plate from which visiting cards are printed is a good example of some elementary principles of engraving. It contains thin lines and thick ones, as well as a considerable variety of curves. An elaborate line engraving, if it is a pure line engraving and nothing else, will contain only these simple elements in different combinations. The real line engraver is always engraving a line more or less broad and deep in one direction or another; he has no other business than this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Engraving]]\n*[[Old master print]]\n*[[Printmaking]]\n*[[Steel engraving]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite EB1911 |volume=16 |pages=721\u2013724 |wstitle=Line Engraving}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bodkinprints.co.uk/links.php Comprehensive Links to online images of prints, and other information.]\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures], an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on line engraving\n\n[[Category:Engraving]]\n", "name_user": "KC Roosters", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding localshort description: \"Engraved images printed on paper\", overriding Wikidata description \"engraved images printed on paper\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_engraving"}
