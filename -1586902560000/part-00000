It received moderate reviews from critics, and failed to recoup its {{INRConvert|600|m}} investment, grossing {{INRConvert|400|m}}.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present day, 2017,Gaurav Kapoor ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), based in suburban [[Miami]], plans to marry his colleague Kavya ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), who happens to be the woman of his dreams, but she prefers a man who is more adventurous and risk-loving.\n\nRunning parallel to his story , is the story of clandestine spy Rishi Purohit ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), who is seen to have been trying to extract some crucial substance from the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. However, when a co-spy, Yakub ([[Darshan Kumaar]]), shoots down an innocent civilian, the dishonest move enrages Rishi. Nonetheless, he returns to Mumbai, where it is revealed that he works for Unit X, a spy organisation headed by Colonel Vijay Saxena ([[Suniel Shetty]]). Rishi explains to Col. Vijay that he can't continue with such routines, and that he wants to start life afresh. Col. Vijay asks him to perform one last job for him, and this involves spying on a minister who Col. Vijay claims to be corrupt and wants to blackmail, and copying data from his cellphone into a hard drive which is wanted by Col. Vijay. Rishi does save contents into the hard drive, but Col. Vijay, having decided that Rishi is useless, instructs Yakub through a text message to kill him. Rishi senses the suspicion, and fights off Yakub and the other spies. Yakub manages to shoot Rishi, destroying the hard drive, but Rishi escapes.\n\nGaurav tries to hang out with Kavya on a date, and also meets her parents, who consider getting him married to Kavya. Meanwhile, he is ordered by his boss to visit Mumbai to close a business deal. Rewinding to Rishi's life, he is shown meeting a man named Gaurav Kapoor, who works in a cyber firm in Mumbai, and has important data about the minister's connections. When Gaurav is murdered by Yakub on account of being a liability, Rishi decides to adopt Gaurav's identity to successfully escape from Yakub after his last mission. This leads to his present-day life in 2017 as Gaurav in a Miami software company meaning Gaurav and Rishi are the same person and the events leading up to his new life took place five years earlier in 2012.\n\nAfter being unintentionally recorded in a viral video and recognised by the members of Unit X, Gaurav is soon attacked by Koko, an associate of Unit X's local contact Jignesh. He is forced to abduct and hide Koko in his car, which is noticed by his friend Dixit ([[Hussain Dalal]]), who tries to help him and unintentionally kills Koko in the struggle. Yakub and other Unit X agents track Gaurav down, and confront him, where he finally confesses, as Rishi, that he needed a life. He is knocked down unconscious, and soon finds himself handcuffed with Kavya who had stopped by his house. Gaurav uses his skills to escape with Kavya from the trouble, and ends up confessing to her that he is a retired covert operations specialist. Kavya berates him, but takes pity on him when she notices his bloody stab wound. The two make love. Later that night, the two find themselves under fire after Unit X agents, headed by Yakub, raid the motel they are hiding in. Rishi hatches a quick scheme to retrieve the data, since the hard drive is damaged, and convinces Yakub to work with him on their final mission.\n\nRishi executes the heist with success, but security guards take notice and begin chasing Rishi. Yakub aborts the operation and abandons him. They meet at Rishi's house, where Rishi kills most of Yakub's henchmen with the help of Kavya. However, Rishi spares Yakub and two of his thugs and orders him to leave his house. Driving away in Rishi's car, Yakub realises that the hard drive Rishi gave is blank, and the car's trunk contains Koko's corpse. Dixit, working with Rishi, crashes into their car in a [[side collision]], and police arriving on the scene discover the body. Yakub and his thugs are killed by the cops as they open fire. Col. Vijay visits Rishi's house to confront him, but is killed in an explosion planned by Rishi. This neutralises Unit X, and Rishi and Kavya soon leave the city with new identities of Hemant and Pooja Khanna.\n\nA mid-credits scene shows Dixit buying machine guns from a local gun store in Miami before putting on a [[hoodie]] and walking away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--As this film has Sequel been released, additions to this section must be sourced, per WP:CRYSTAL-->\n* [[Sidharth Malhotra]] as Rishi Purohit/ Gaurav Kapoor  \n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Kavya Rishi Purohit\n* [[Suniel Shetty]] as Colonel Vijay Kumar Saxena\n* [[Darshan Kumaar]] as Yakub Sabri\n* [[Hussain Dalal]] as Arth Dixit, Rishi's friend and colleague\n* [[Rajit Kapur]] as Kavya's father\n* [[Supriya Pilgaonkar]] as Kavya's mother\n* [[Amit Mistry]] as Jignesh Patel\n* [[Sijoy Varghese]] as Ramachandra Rao\n* [[Shaheed Woods]] as Koko\n* [[Kushal Punjabi]] as Willy\n* Zachary Coffin as CEO Jim\n* Hemant Koumar as Robbie\n* Nikita Sachdev as Nikki\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] Gaurav Kapoor Plastic Before Surgery\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nSiddharth Anand has stated that the movie was originally envisioned as a sequel to the 2014 film [[Bang Bang!]] However, it was later clarified in an interview that the movie would be a standalone.<ref name=sequel>{{cite web | url = http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141012/entertainment-bollywood/article/bang-bang-sequel | title = Bang Bang sequel on?|website=[[Deccan Chronicle]] | date = 12 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/bang-bang%E2%80%99-a-sequel-in-the-pipeline_1481537.html | title = 'Bang Bang': A sequel in the pipeline? |website=Zeenews.india.com| date = 8 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/hrithik-roshan-katrina-kaifs-bang-bang-have-sequel-soon-610704 | title = Hrithik Roshan, Katrina Kaif's 'Bang Bang' to have a Sequel Soon? |website=Ibtimes.co.in| date = 7 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in mid-2016 under the working title ''Reloaded''.<ref name=\"bb2\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/sidharth-malhotra-gets-injured-on-reloaded-sets-4428364/ |title=Sidharth Malhotra gets injured on Reload sets |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref> In September 2016, it was reported that the international shooting schedule of ''A Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky'' had been canceled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-international-shooting-schedule-of-bang-bang-reloaded-scrapped-2254978 |title=International shooting schedule of 'Bang Bang Reloaded' scrapped &#124; Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis |website=Dnaindia.com |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref> Later it was revealed by a close source that \"...there will be another long schedule in December but the location is yet to be finalised.

In its broadest outline, his domestic policy worked to eliminate the heritage of the [[6 January Dictatorship|Alexandrine dictatorship's]] centralism, censorship, and military control, and to pacify the country by solving the Serb-Croat problem.<ref>Hoptner, p. 26</ref> Paul wanted to achieve a Serb-Croat reconciliation, but also felt for a considerable period of time that he had the duty to hand over the kingdom to Peter more or less unchanged when he reached his maturity, and thus was unwilling to entertain constitutional changes.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} Through as Prince Regent, Paul possessed very broad powers, but he was much less inclined to exercise these powers, leading Yugoslavia in the years 1934-41 to be labelled \"a dictatorship without a dictator\".{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} Paul had been thrust into a position of power that he did not want by Alexander's assassination (which was why Alexander had chosen him in his will to serve as a regent, knowing he would never try to seize the throne from his son), and throughout his regency he gave the impression that ruling Yugoslavia was a burden to him.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} A French diplomat described Paul as a man whose \"incontestable qualities of character, balance, and taste...Oxonian dilettantism and charm which he exercised on his visitors where were useless in the present circumstances and in a country where arguments of might are the only ones which count\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=202}} Married to a [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] princess and intensely [[Anglophile]] and [[Hellenophile]], Paul distrusted [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], though the British historian D. C. Watt noted that Paul's \"nerves tended to betray him under stress and that he was by nature inclined to yield to pressure rather than withstand it\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=202}} The heavy losses taken by [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] in [[World War I]] made Paul very averse to engaging in another war and led him to favoring neutralist policies despite Yugoslavia's alliance with France.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=290}} During the First World War, Serbia had proportionally taken the [[World War I casualties|heaviest losses]]; one out of five Serbs who were alive in 1914 were dead by 1918.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=131}}\n\nOn 24 June 1935, Paul appointed [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] Prime Minister with a mandate to deal with the Great Depression and find a solution to the \"Croat question\".{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}} Stojadinovi\u0107 believed that the solution to the Great Depression were closer economic ties with Germany, which had more people than what it could feed and lacked many of the raw materials necessary for a modern industrial economy.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}} As Germany needed both food and raw materials such as iron, bauxite, copper and manganese, Yugoslav exports of both agricultural products and of minerals to the ''Reich'' bloomed from 1935 onward, leading to an economic revival and to placing Yugoslavia in the German economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}}\n\nYugoslavia had signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1927, at a time when the [[Rhineland]] was still [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied by France]], and during Franco-Yugoslav staff talks, it was promised that France would take the offensive into western Germany if Germany should start another war. As long as the Rhineland remained a demilitarized zone, there was always the possibility of the French launching an offensive into western Germany, which reassured Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=239-240 & 261}} The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the treaty of Versailles had imposed was \"...the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe\" for as long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, it was impossible for Germany to attack any of France's allies in Eastern Europe without exposing itself to the risk of a devastating French offensive into western Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=239-240}} The [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] on 7 March 1936 meant that Germany started building the West Wall along its border with France, which ended any hope of a French offensive into western Germany. On 15\u201320 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the [[Little Entente]] ([[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and Yugoslavia) met in [[Bucharest]] to discuss their plans now that the Rhineland was re-militarized.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=261}} The gloomy conclusion of the Bucharest meeting was that France was not a factor in Eastern Europe, and henceforward there were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely the [[Soviet Union]] and Germany, and the victory of either in another war would mean the end of their independence.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=261}}\n\nDespite his pro-British and pro-French feelings, Paul believed in the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland that Yugoslavia needed to tilt its foreign policy towards Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216}} Likewise, the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact|Hoare-Laval pact]] of 1935 and British attempts to improve Anglo-Italian relations such as the [[Nyon Conference|\"Gentlemen's Agreement\" of 1937]] and the [[Easter Accords]] of 1938 caused Paul to believe the British were willing to sacrifice Yugoslavia for the sake of better relations with Italy.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216}} Stojadinovi\u0107, who openly admired Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, made a major diplomatic push with the tacit support of the Prince Regent for better relations with the fascist states in the winter of 1936-37.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216-217}} Without informing France, Czechoslovakia or Romania, Stojadinovi\u0107 signed an agreement with Italy on 25 March 1937 that badly weakened the Little Entente.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} Just before Stojadinovi\u0107 signed the treaty, Paul let the British minister in [[Belgrade]], [[Ronald Hugh Campbell|Ronald Campbell]], know of what was being planned.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} Paul seems to have believed that if Yugoslavia was seen as failing within the Italian sphere of influence, then this might prompt a British response to pull Yugoslavia in the other direction.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} \n[[File:MIguelBenesCarolIIPabloDeYugoslavia1936.jpeg|thumb|King [[Carol II of Romania]] with Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], Yugoslav regent Prince Paul, and [[Prince Nicholas of Romania]] in Bucharest in 1936.|alt=]]\nIn January 1939, Stojadinovi\u0107 had told Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] of his wish to turn his [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] into the only legal party, saying he wanted to establish a fascist dictatorship that carry out a pro-Italian foreign policy \"to find a balanced situation and security within the framework of the [[Axis powers|Axis]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} At the same time, the Croat deputies in the ''skupshtina'' (parliament) called on foreign powers to intervene to give the Croats \"liberty of choice and destiny\", accusing Stojadinovi\u0107 of being a tyrant.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} On 4 February 1939, Paul dismissed Stojadinovi\u0107 as prime minister and at that point the Yugoslav tilt towards the Axis was stopped.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} After dismissing Stojadinovi\u0107, Paul rejected an Italian appeal to support the Italian annexation of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u20131939)|Albania]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=207}} On 15 March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany occupied]] the Czech half of the rump state of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovakia]] (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938), turning it into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} The fact that despite the way that [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] and the rest of the leaders of Czecho-Slovakia had endeavored to carry out a slavishly pro-German foreign policy, nonetheless saw the ''Reich'' extinguish its independence came as a considerable shock to Paul.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}}\n\nLater, when the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italians did annex Albania]] on Easter weekend 1939, Paul declined to make a protest, which severely strained relations with Yugoslavia's [[Balkan Pact]] ally [[Turkey]], which protested most vehemently against the annexation of a Muslim majority nation which the Turks had historically close ties with.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} The Italian annexation of Albania led to Italy controlling both sides of the [[Strait of Otranto]], and thus allowed the Italians to cut Yugoslavia off from access to the rest of the world.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} On 12 May 1939, Britain and Turkey issued a joint declaration promising \"to ensure the establishment of security in the [[Balkans]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}} As Paul was about to make a state visit to Italy, he found the statement from the Turkish ambassador in Belgrade suggesting that Yugoslavia work with Turkey in the spirit of the Anglo-Turkish declaration to resist any further Italian advances in the Balkans very poorly timed and made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with the Turkish proposal.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}}\n\nHowever, Paul did back a plan floated by the Turkish foreign minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] for [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] to join the Balkan Pact, and in a letter urged [[King Carol II of Romania]] to cede part of the [[Dobruja]] region as the price of Bulgaria joining the Balkan Pact.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} In his letter, Paul stressed the importance of stopping Italy from gobbling up more Balkan nations, which required getting the Bulgarians out of the Italian sphere of influence ([[King Boris III of Bulgaria]] was married to the daughter of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]).{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} He wrote that he wanted the Bulgarians \"off my back\" to allow the Yugoslavs and Greeks to focus on countering the Italians who were now building up their forces in their [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|new colony of Albania]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} Unlike the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarians]], whom Paul felt would never abandon their claims against Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians were felt to be more tractable.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=282}} After Germany and Italy, Hungary was the nation that Paul worried about the most as he noted that Danube river valley ran down from the Hungarian plain straight to Belgrade.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=282}} At the same time, Yugoslavia began staff talks with Greece with the aim of resisting an Italian invasion of either nation.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}} A major problem for Yugoslavia was the lack of modern weapons together with the money to pay for them.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Watt wrote that \"Paul's tactics were aimed at winning credits and securing arms deliveries wherever he could, in [[Berlin]], [[Paris]] or [[London]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} After talking to [[Raymond Brug\u00e8re]], the French minister in Belgrade, the latter promised the prince regent that he would fly to Paris personally to lobby for Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} On 29 June 1939, it was that announced that the Bank Seligmannn of Paris was going to make a loan of 600 million francs to Yugoslavia that was to be spent on weapons for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Yugoslav military]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} The Germans had broken the Yugoslav diplomatic codes and were well aware of Paul's attempts to play off the [[Axis powers]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] to secure the best deal for Yugoslavia; Paul's salvation in 1939 rested with the fact that Germany was about to invade [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and needed raw materials from Yugoslavia like bauxite and copper to keep the German armaments industry going.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} \n\nIn 1939, Prince Paul, as acting head of state, accepted an official invitation from [[Adolf Hitler]] and spent nine days in Berlin. During his visit to Berlin, a massive effort was made to persuade Paul to not join the \"peace front\" that was meant to \"contain\" Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Paul was greeted by Hitler at the train station in Berlin, was made the guest of honor at a reception and dinner at the Reich Chancellery, visited the Potsdam military base, saw a gala performance of Wagner at the Berlin opera, and reviewed two major military parades meant to impress upon him the power of the ''Reich''.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} For the first part of his trip, Paul stayed at Bellevue, an old imperial palace and then for the last three days, at Goring's estate at Karinhall.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Despite all the pomp, Paul during his visit to Germany repeatedly refused the demands made by his hosts to sign an economic agreement that would have turned Yugoslavia into a German economic colony or some overt pro-Axis gesture like pulling Yugoslavia out of the [[League of Nations]] and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}} The German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] called Paul a \"log\" (a German slang term meaning somebody who is very stupid) while Hitler was very angry that despite all the lavish hospitality the only concession Paul made was to slightly readjust the exchange rate between the ''[[Reichmark]]'' and the [[Yugoslav dinar|Dinar]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} In return for readjusting the exchange rate, Paul forced the Germans to finally deliver some of the aircraft that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance in 1938, but the Germans kept finding excuses not to deliver.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}}\n\nWhile he was in Germany, Paul dispatched General [[Petar Pe\u0161i\u0107]] on a secret mission to Paris and London to find out what were the Anglo-French plans in the event of a war.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 told [[Lord Gort]] of the British General Staff and French Marshal [[Maurice Gamelin]] that Yugoslavia would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland, but would be willing to enter the war on the Allied side the moment the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Adriatic sea]]s came under Allied operational control.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 argued that from the Allied viewpoint that Yugoslav neutrality could be advantageous in the sense that Yugoslavia at present could not stop the German [[Wehrmacht]] from occupying the country if Hitler so desired, which would allow the Germans to exploit all of the crucial raw materials of Yugoslavia whereas if Yugoslavia remained neutral and entered the war when the Allies could support her, then those raw materials would be permanently denied to the Germans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 found that the French, who preferred that fighting take place in anywhere but France, were far more interested in having Yugoslavia enter the conflict if the [[Danzig crisis]] should lead to a war than the British.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} From Marshal Gamelin he learned the French were already planning on having the [[Army of the Levant]] commanded by [[Maxime Weygand]] land at [[Thessaloniki]] to march up the Balkans to link up with the Yugoslavs and the Romanians to aid the Poles.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} In May 1939, Yugoslavia changed its diplomatic codes, which stopped both the Italians and Germans from reading the Yugoslav codes.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} The same month, when the Romanian Foreign Minister, [[Grigore Gafencu]], visited Belgrade, Paul spoke to him of his wish for both Yugoslavia and Romania to have closer ties with Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Despite repeated pressure from both the German and Italian ministers in Belgrade, Paul refused their demand that Yugoslavia leave the League of Nations as a symbolic move to show that Yugoslavia was now associated with the Axis states.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} As Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had both left the League of Nations in 1933 while Italy had left the League in 1937, the Axis powers always attached immense symbolic importance to having other nations leaving the League as showing diplomatic alignment with them.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}}\n\nIn June 1939, Paul warned the [[United States|American]] ambassador to Yugoslavia that the ''Forschungsamt'' (research office) was reading all of the diplomatic cables going into and out of Belgrade, including the American ones, and the ambassador should be careful what information he cabled back to [[Washington D.C.|Washington]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} On 15 July 1939, Paul left Belgrade to visit London with a stop over in Paris to see Pe\u0161i\u0107.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} From Pe\u0161i\u0107, Paul learned that he had the impression that on one hand, the French were keen to start a second front in the Balkans in the event of war while on the other hand that the French Navy would play only a defensive role, guarding convoys from [[French Algeria|Algeria]] to France. In London, Paul advocated that Britain launch a \"[[preemptive war]]\" against Italy, saying that if Italy were knocked out, then Yugoslavia would definitely move closer to Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Paul ordered that the Yugoslav National Bank's gold reserves be transferred to London as a sign of his faith in Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} He told his British hosts that Yugoslavia was not ready to join the \"peace front\" yet, but was moving in that direction.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Paul also told the Foreign Secretary, [[Lord Halifax]], that he would use his influence with the more hesitant Balkan Pact nations, namely Romania and Greece to try to bring them into the \"peace front\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} During the same visit, he was installed as a [[Knight of the Garter]], the most important British order of chivalry, by [[King George VI]], which greatly offended Hitler, who complained that Paul's heart was with the British.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}}\n\nDuring his talks with Lord Halifax in London, Paul received elusive replies to his demands for a British \"preemptive war\" against Italy as Paul contended that as long as the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' existed, there was always the possibility of Yugoslavia being cut off from Britain and France.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Both the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], and Lord Halifax regarded Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] as the more moderate and reasonable of the fascist leaders who despite signing the [[Pact of Steel]] in May might still be \"peeled off\" from his alliance with Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Fearful of being cut off, Paul advocated to Halifax that if Britain ended up declaring war on Germany as a result of the latter invading Poland, then Britain should immediately launch air and naval attacks to destroy the ''Regia Marina'' and the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' regardless if Italy was neutral or not.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} It was Paul's belief that even if Mussolini declared neutrality at first that it was inevitable that he would come into the war on Germany's side at some point.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Paul very much wanted an Anglo-French landing at the Greek city of Thessaloniki in the event of war as he believed that this was the only way that Yugoslavia could resist a German invasion.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Paul also expressed his hope that the British would include the Soviet Union the proposed \"peace front\" as the best way of deterring Germany from invading Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} At the same that Paul was visiting London, the Yugoslav minister of finance [[Vojin \u0110uri\u010di\u0107]] was in Paris where he signed on 14 July an agreement with the Premier [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] for France to sell Yugloslavia anti-aircraft guns, trucks, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns, tanks and tank transporters.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}}\n\nAs the Danzig crisis pushed Europe to the brink of war, [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] became convinced of the necessity of \"throwing a bridge across the abyss which separated Serb from Croat\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} Paul supported Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]]'s efforts to reach an understanding with Ma\u010dek, as despite his wish to hand over Yugoslavia unchanged to King Peter when he reached his majority, he felt that an end to the Serb-Croat dispute was the best way to allow Yugoslavia to survive the coming storm.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=141-142}} On 20 August 1939, the [[Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek Agreement]] set up the [[Banovina of Croatia]] to be ruled by a ''ban'' (governor) responsible to the king and a ''sabor'' (parliament) in [[Zagreb]].{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The central government retained control of the monarchy, foreign affairs, national defence, foreign trade, commerce, transport, public security, religion, mining, weights and measures, insurance, and education policy, but Croatia was to have its own legislature in [[Zagreb]], with a separate budget.<ref>Hoptner, p. 154</ref> The ''sprorazum'' (agreement) granted broad autonomy to Croatia, and partitioned [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as the government agreed to Ma\u010dek's demand that all of the Croats in Yugoslavia should live under the authority of the Croatian ''banovina''.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The ''sprorazum'' was popular with moderate Croat opinion, but it was extremely unpopular with the [[Bosnian Muslims]] who objected to the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} Likewise, the Serbian opinion was outraged by that the ''sprorazum'' had \"abandoned\" the ''[[Pre\u010dani (Serbs)|pre\u010dani]]'' Serbs in Bosnia and the ''[[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]'' region to Croat rule.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The charge that Paul and Cvetkovi\u0107 had \"sold out\" to the Croats with the ''sprorazum'' made them unpopular with the Serbs, and if it did not cause the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat of 26 March 1941]], certainly was the essential prerequisite for the coup.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142-142}} Finally, the [[Slovenes]] demanded that a similar degree of autonomy should be granted to them.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}}\n\nOn 26 August 1939 as the [[Danzig crisis]] moved towards its climax, Paul in a letter to Lord Halifax once again urged that Britain launch a \"preemptive war\" against Italy if Germany should invade Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} The prince regent warned if Germany conquered Poland, then Italy would sooner or later enter the war, and if that happened, the Italian forces in Albania with support from Bulgaria would be used to threaten the other Balkan states.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Paul concluded in that case \"a rot throughout the Balkans\" would follow as the other Balkan states together with Turkey would turn towards Germany to protect them from Italy.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Sir [[Ronald Ian Campbell|Ronald Campbell]], the British minister in Belgrade in a cable to Lord Halifax wrote that Paul was \"in the last stages of despair\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Halifax wrote on the margin on Paul's letter that he was suffering from [[manic-depression]] again.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} Brug\u00e8re, who very much liked Paul, proved more sympathetic, and in a dispatch to Paris urged that France land a force at Thessaloniki if Germany should invade Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} The French proved supportive of the idea of landing at Thessaloniki, but Allied strategy was determined by an Inter-Allied War Council, and the British were stoutly opposed to the French plans for a \"second front\" in the Balkans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}}\n\nThe news of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] was an especially bitter blow for Paul as it ensured that the two strongest powers in Eastern Europe would be working together, and ended the regent's hopes of an Anglo-French alliance which might finally rid Yugoslavia of the constant Italian efforts to undermine national unity.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} When the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939 with the [[German invasion of Poland]], Yugoslavia declared its neutrality.<ref>Hoptner, p. 167</ref> During the \"[[Phoney War]]\", Paul arranged for Yugoslavia to step up deliveries of copper to Germany in exchanges for promises that Germany would finally deliver arms that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance, but which the ''Reich'' kept finding excuses not to deliver.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} Germany also wanted that Yugoslavia not only refuse to join the British-inspired \"peace front\", but also formally align its diplomacy with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} In his sympathies, Paul preferred that France and Britain win the war, but he was markedly afraid of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} Paul repeatedly pressed for a revival of the [[Salonika Front]] strategy of [[First World War]], arguing that if French and British forces landed at Thessaloniki, which would place them in a position to aid Yugoslavia, then he might lean more towards the Allied side.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} During the Phony War, a popular, if erroneous rumor in Croatia that Paul was planning to enter the war on the Allied side and send Croat regiments to man the [[Maginot Line]] in France increased support for Croat separatism.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}}\n\nOn 25 March 1941, the [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslav government signed]] the Axis [[Tripartite Pact]], with significant reservations, as three notes were appended. The first note obliged the Axis powers to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia. In the second note the Axis powers promised not to ask Yugoslavia for any military assistance, and in the third they promised not to ask permission to move military forces across Yugoslav territory during the war.<ref>Hoptner, p. 240</ref> Nonetheless, the signing of the pact did not sit well with several elements of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]].

In its broadest outline, his domestic policy worked to eliminate the heritage of the [[6 January Dictatorship|Alexandrine dictatorship's]] centralism, censorship, and military control, and to pacify the country by solving the Serb-Croat problem.<ref>Hoptner, p. 26</ref> Paul wanted to achieve a Serb-Croat reconciliation, but also felt for a considerable period of time that he had the duty to hand over the kingdom to Peter more or less unchanged when he reached his maturity, and thus was unwilling to entertain constitutional changes.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} Through as Prince Regent, Paul possessed very broad powers, but he was much less inclined to exercise these powers, leading Yugoslavia in the years 1934-41 to be labelled \"a dictatorship without a dictator\".{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} Paul had been thrust into a position of power that he did not want by Alexander's assassination (which was why Alexander had chosen him in his will to serve as a regent, knowing he would never try to seize the throne from his son), and throughout his regency he gave the impression that ruling Yugoslavia was a burden to him.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=139}} A French diplomat described Paul as a man whose \"incontestable qualities of character, balance, and taste...Oxonian dilettantism and charm which he exercised on his visitors where were useless in the present circumstances and in a country where arguments of might are the only ones which count\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=202}} Married to a [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] princess and intensely [[Anglophile]] and [[Hellenophile]], Paul distrusted [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], though the British historian D. C. Watt noted that Paul's \"nerves tended to betray him under stress and that he was by nature inclined to yield to pressure rather than withstand it\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=202}} The heavy losses taken by [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] in [[World War I]] made Paul very averse to engaging in another war and led him to favoring neutralist policies despite Yugoslavia's alliance with France.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=290}} During the First World War, Serbia had proportionally taken the [[World War I casualties|heaviest losses]]; one out of five Serbs who were alive in 1914 were dead by 1918.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=131}}\n\nOn 24 June 1935, Paul appointed [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] Prime Minister with a mandate to deal with the Great Depression and find a solution to the \"Croat question\".{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}} Stojadinovi\u0107 believed that the solution to the Great Depression were closer economic ties with Germany, which had more people than what it could feed and lacked many of the raw materials necessary for a modern industrial economy.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}} As Germany needed both food and raw materials such as iron, bauxite, copper and manganese, Yugoslav exports of both agricultural products and of minerals to the ''Reich'' bloomed from 1935 onward, leading to an economic revival and to placing Yugoslavia in the German economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=140}}\n\nYugoslavia had signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1927, at a time when the [[Rhineland]] was still [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied by France]], and during Franco-Yugoslav staff talks, it was promised that France would take the offensive into western Germany if Germany should start another war. As long as the Rhineland remained a demilitarized zone, there was always the possibility of the French launching an offensive into western Germany, which reassured Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=239-240 & 261}} The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the treaty of Versailles had imposed was \"...the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe\" for as long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, it was impossible for Germany to attack any of France's allies in Eastern Europe without exposing itself to the risk of a devastating French offensive into western Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=239-240}} The [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] on 7 March 1936 meant that Germany started building the West Wall along its border with France, which ended any hope of a French offensive into western Germany. On 15\u201320 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the [[Little Entente]] ([[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and Yugoslavia) met in [[Bucharest]] to discuss their plans now that the Rhineland was re-militarized.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=261}} The gloomy conclusion of the Bucharest meeting was that France was not a factor in Eastern Europe, and henceforward there were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely the [[Soviet Union]] and Germany, and the victory of either in another war would mean the end of their independence.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=261}}\n\nDespite his pro-British and pro-French feelings, Paul believed in the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland that Yugoslavia needed to tilt its foreign policy towards Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216}} Likewise, the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact|Hoare-Laval pact]] of 1935 and British attempts to improve Anglo-Italian relations such as the [[Nyon Conference|\"Gentlemen's Agreement\" of 1937]] and the [[Easter Accords]] of 1938 caused Paul to believe the British were willing to sacrifice Yugoslavia for the sake of better relations with Italy.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216}} Stojadinovi\u0107, who openly admired Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, made a major diplomatic push with the tacit support of the Prince Regent for better relations with the fascist states in the winter of 1936-37.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=216-217}} Without informing France, Czechoslovakia or Romania, Stojadinovi\u0107 signed an agreement with Italy on 25 March 1937 that badly weakened the Little Entente.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} Just before Stojadinovi\u0107 signed the treaty, Paul let the British minister in [[Belgrade]], [[Ronald Hugh Campbell|Ronald Campbell]], know of what was being planned.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} Paul seems to have believed that if Yugoslavia was seen as failing within the Italian sphere of influence, then this might prompt a British response to pull Yugoslavia in the other direction.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=217}} \n[[File:MIguelBenesCarolIIPabloDeYugoslavia1936.jpeg|thumb|King [[Carol II of Romania]] with Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], Yugoslav regent Prince Paul, and [[Prince Nicholas of Romania]] in Bucharest in 1936.|alt=]]\nIn January 1939, Stojadinovi\u0107 had told Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] of his wish to turn his [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] into the only legal party, saying he wanted to establish a fascist dictatorship that carry out a pro-Italian foreign policy \"to find a balanced situation and security within the framework of the [[Axis powers|Axis]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} At the same time, the Croat deputies in the ''skupshtina'' (parliament) called on foreign powers to intervene to give the Croats \"liberty of choice and destiny\", accusing Stojadinovi\u0107 of being a tyrant.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} On 4 February 1939, Paul dismissed Stojadinovi\u0107 as prime minister and at that point the Yugoslav tilt towards the Axis was stopped.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} After dismissing Stojadinovi\u0107, Paul rejected an Italian appeal to support the Italian annexation of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u20131939)|Albania]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=207}} On 15 March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany occupied]] the Czech half of the rump state of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovakia]] (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938), turning it into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} The fact that despite the way that [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] and the rest of the leaders of Czecho-Slovakia had endeavored to carry out a slavishly pro-German foreign policy, nonetheless saw the ''Reich'' extinguish its independence came as a considerable shock to Paul.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}}\n\nLater, when the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italians did annex Albania]] on Easter weekend 1939, Paul declined to make a protest, which severely strained relations with Yugoslavia's [[Balkan Pact]] ally [[Turkey]], which protested most vehemently against the annexation of a Muslim majority nation which the Turks had historically close ties with.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} The Italian annexation of Albania led to Italy controlling both sides of the [[Strait of Otranto]], and thus allowed the Italians to cut Yugoslavia off from access to the rest of the world.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} On 12 May 1939, Britain and Turkey issued a joint declaration promising \"to ensure the establishment of security in the [[Balkans]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}} As Paul was about to make a state visit to Italy, he found the statement from the Turkish ambassador in Belgrade suggesting that Yugoslavia work with Turkey in the spirit of the Anglo-Turkish declaration to resist any further Italian advances in the Balkans very poorly timed and made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with the Turkish proposal.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}}\n\nHowever, Paul did back a plan floated by the Turkish foreign minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] for [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] to join the Balkan Pact, and in a letter urged [[King Carol II of Romania]] to cede part of the [[Dobruja]] region as the price of Bulgaria joining the Balkan Pact.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} In his letter, Paul stressed the importance of stopping Italy from gobbling up more Balkan nations, which required getting the Bulgarians out of the Italian sphere of influence ([[King Boris III of Bulgaria]] was married to the daughter of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]).{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} He wrote that he wanted the Bulgarians \"off my back\" to allow the Yugoslavs and Greeks to focus on countering the Italians who were now building up their forces in their [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|new colony of Albania]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=292}} Unlike the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarians]], whom Paul felt would never abandon their claims against Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians were felt to be more tractable.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=282}} After Germany and Italy, Hungary was the nation that Paul worried about the most as he noted that Danube river valley ran down from the Hungarian plain straight to Belgrade.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=282}} At the same time, Yugoslavia began staff talks with Greece with the aim of resisting an Italian invasion of either nation.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=291}} A major problem for Yugoslavia was the lack of modern weapons together with the money to pay for them.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Watt wrote that \"Paul's tactics were aimed at winning credits and securing arms deliveries wherever he could, in [[Berlin]], [[Paris]] or [[London]]\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} After talking to [[Raymond Brug\u00e8re]], the French minister in Belgrade, the latter promised the prince regent that he would fly to Paris personally to lobby for Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} On 29 June 1939, it was that announced that the Bank Seligmannn of Paris was going to make a loan of 600 million francs to Yugoslavia that was to be spent on weapons for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Yugoslav military]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} The Germans had broken the Yugoslav diplomatic codes and were well aware of Paul's attempts to play off the [[Axis powers]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] to secure the best deal for Yugoslavia; Paul's salvation in 1939 rested with the fact that Germany was about to invade [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and needed raw materials from Yugoslavia like bauxite and copper to keep the German armaments industry going.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} \n\nIn 1939, Prince Paul, as acting head of state, accepted an official invitation from [[Adolf Hitler]] and spent nine days in Berlin. During his visit to Berlin, a massive effort was made to persuade Paul to not join the \"peace front\" that was meant to \"contain\" Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Paul was greeted by Hitler at the train station in Berlin, was made the guest of honor at a reception and dinner at the Reich Chancellery, visited the Potsdam military base, saw a gala performance of Wagner at the Berlin opera, and reviewed two major military parades meant to impress upon him the power of the ''Reich''.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} For the first part of his trip, Paul stayed at Bellevue, an old imperial palace and then for the last three days, at Goring's estate at Karinhall.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} Despite all the pomp, Paul during his visit to Germany repeatedly refused the demands made by his hosts to sign an economic agreement that would have turned Yugoslavia into a German economic colony or some overt pro-Axis gesture like pulling Yugoslavia out of the [[League of Nations]] and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}} The German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] called Paul a \"log\" (a German slang term meaning somebody who is very stupid) while Hitler was very angry that despite all the lavish hospitality the only concession Paul made was to slightly readjust the exchange rate between the ''[[Reichmark]]'' and the [[Yugoslav dinar|Dinar]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}} In return for readjusting the exchange rate, Paul forced the Germans to finally deliver some of the aircraft that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance in 1938, but the Germans kept finding excuses not to deliver.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=293}}\n\nWhile he was in Germany, Paul dispatched General [[Petar Pe\u0161i\u0107]] on a secret mission to Paris and London to find out what were the Anglo-French plans in the event of a war.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 told [[Lord Gort]] of the British General Staff and French Marshal [[Maurice Gamelin]] that Yugoslavia would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland, but would be willing to enter the war on the Allied side the moment the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Adriatic sea]]s came under Allied operational control.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 argued that from the Allied viewpoint that Yugoslav neutrality could be advantageous in the sense that Yugoslavia at present could not stop the German [[Wehrmacht]] from occupying the country if Hitler so desired, which would allow the Germans to exploit all of the crucial raw materials of Yugoslavia whereas if Yugoslavia remained neutral and entered the war when the Allies could support her, then those raw materials would be permanently denied to the Germans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} Pe\u0161i\u0107 found that the French, who preferred that fighting take place in anywhere but France, were far more interested in having Yugoslavia enter the conflict if the [[Danzig crisis]] should lead to a war than the British.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} From Marshal Gamelin he learned the French were already planning on having the [[Army of the Levant]] commanded by [[Maxime Weygand]] land at [[Thessaloniki]] to march up the Balkans to link up with the Yugoslavs and the Romanians to aid the Poles.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}} In May 1939, Yugoslavia changed its diplomatic codes, which stopped both the Italians and Germans from reading the Yugoslav codes.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} The same month, when the Romanian Foreign Minister, [[Grigore Gafencu]], visited Belgrade, Paul spoke to him of his wish for both Yugoslavia and Romania to have closer ties with Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Despite repeated pressure from both the German and Italian ministers in Belgrade, Paul refused their demand that Yugoslavia leave the League of Nations as a symbolic move to show that Yugoslavia was now associated with the Axis states.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} As Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had both left the League of Nations in 1933 while Italy had left the League in 1937, the Axis powers always attached immense symbolic importance to having other nations leaving the League as showing diplomatic alignment with them.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}}\n\nIn June 1939, Paul warned the [[United States|American]] ambassador to Yugoslavia that the ''Forschungsamt'' (research office) was reading all of the diplomatic cables going into and out of Belgrade, including the American ones, and the ambassador should be careful what information he cabled back to [[Washington D.C.|Washington]].{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} On 15 July 1939, Paul left Belgrade to visit London with a stop over in Paris to see Pe\u0161i\u0107.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} From Pe\u0161i\u0107, Paul learned that he had the impression that on one hand, the French were keen to start a second front in the Balkans in the event of war while on the other hand that the French Navy would play only a defensive role, guarding convoys from [[French Algeria|Algeria]] to France. In London, Paul advocated that Britain launch a \"[[preemptive war]]\" against Italy, saying that if Italy were knocked out, then Yugoslavia would definitely move closer to Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Paul ordered that the Yugoslav National Bank's gold reserves be transferred to London as a sign of his faith in Britain.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} He told his British hosts that Yugoslavia was not ready to join the \"peace front\" yet, but was moving in that direction.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} Paul also told the Foreign Secretary, [[Lord Halifax]], that he would use his influence with the more hesitant Balkan Pact nations, namely Romania and Greece to try to bring them into the \"peace front\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}} During the same visit, he was installed as a [[Knight of the Garter]], the most important British order of chivalry, by [[King George VI]], which greatly offended Hitler, who complained that Paul's heart was with the British.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=295}}\n\nDuring his talks with Lord Halifax in London, Paul received elusive replies to his demands for a British \"preemptive war\" against Italy as Paul contended that as long as the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' existed, there was always the possibility of Yugoslavia being cut off from Britain and France.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Both the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], and Lord Halifax regarded Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] as the more moderate and reasonable of the fascist leaders who despite signing the [[Pact of Steel]] in May might still be \"peeled off\" from his alliance with Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Fearful of being cut off, Paul advocated to Halifax that if Britain ended up declaring war on Germany as a result of the latter invading Poland, then Britain should immediately launch air and naval attacks to destroy the ''Regia Marina'' and the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' regardless if Italy was neutral or not.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} It was Paul's belief that even if Mussolini declared neutrality at first that it was inevitable that he would come into the war on Germany's side at some point.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} Paul very much wanted an Anglo-French landing at the Greek city of Thessaloniki in the event of war as he believed that this was the only way that Yugoslavia could resist a German invasion.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Paul also expressed his hope that the British would include the Soviet Union the proposed \"peace front\" as the best way of deterring Germany from invading Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=296}} At the same that Paul was visiting London, the Yugoslav minister of finance [[Vojin \u0110uri\u010di\u0107]] was in Paris where he signed on 14 July an agreement with the Premier [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] for France to sell Yugloslavia anti-aircraft guns, trucks, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns, tanks and tank transporters.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=294}}\n\nAs the Danzig crisis pushed Europe to the brink of war, [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] became convinced of the necessity of \"throwing a bridge across the abyss which separated Serb from Croat\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=203}} Paul supported Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]]'s efforts to reach an understanding with Ma\u010dek, as despite his wish to hand over Yugoslavia unchanged to King Peter when he reached his majority, he felt that an end to the Serb-Croat dispute was the best way to allow Yugoslavia to survive the coming storm.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=141-142}} On 20 August 1939, the [[Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek Agreement]] set up the [[Banovina of Croatia]] to be ruled by a ''ban'' (governor) responsible to the king and a ''sabor'' (parliament) in [[Zagreb]].{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The central government retained control of the monarchy, foreign affairs, national defence, foreign trade, commerce, transport, public security, religion, mining, weights and measures, insurance, and education policy, but Croatia was to have its own legislature in [[Zagreb]], with a separate budget.<ref>Hoptner, p. 154</ref> The ''sprorazum'' (agreement) granted broad autonomy to Croatia, and partitioned [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as the government agreed to Ma\u010dek's demand that all of the Croats in Yugoslavia should live under the authority of the Croatian ''banovina''.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The ''sprorazum'' was popular with moderate Croat opinion, but it was extremely unpopular with the [[Bosnian Muslims]] who objected to the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} Likewise, the Serbian opinion was outraged by that the ''sprorazum'' had \"abandoned\" the ''[[Pre\u010dani (Serbs)|pre\u010dani]]'' Serbs in Bosnia and the ''[[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]'' region to Croat rule.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}} The charge that Paul and Cvetkovi\u0107 had \"sold out\" to the Croats with the ''sprorazum'' made them unpopular with the Serbs, and if it did not cause the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat of 26 March 1941]], certainly was the essential prerequisite for the coup.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142-142}} Finally, the [[Slovenes]] demanded that a similar degree of autonomy should be granted to them.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}}\n\nOn 26 August 1939 as the [[Danzig crisis]] moved towards its climax, Paul in a letter to Lord Halifax once again urged that Britain launch a \"preemptive war\" against Italy if Germany should invade Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} The prince regent warned if Germany conquered Poland, then Italy would sooner or later enter the war, and if that happened, the Italian forces in Albania with support from Bulgaria would be used to threaten the other Balkan states.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Paul concluded in that case \"a rot throughout the Balkans\" would follow as the other Balkan states together with Turkey would turn towards Germany to protect them from Italy.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Sir [[Ronald Ian Campbell|Ronald Campbell]], the British minister in Belgrade in a cable to Lord Halifax wrote that Paul was \"in the last stages of despair\".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=472}} Halifax wrote on the margin on Paul's letter that he was suffering from [[manic-depression]] again.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} Brug\u00e8re, who very much liked Paul, proved more sympathetic, and in a dispatch to Paris urged that France land a force at Thessaloniki if Germany should invade Poland.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} The French proved supportive of the idea of landing at Thessaloniki, but Allied strategy was determined by an Inter-Allied War Council, and the British were stoutly opposed to the French plans for a \"second front\" in the Balkans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}}\n\nThe news of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] was an especially bitter blow for Paul as it ensured that the two strongest powers in Eastern Europe would be working together, and ended the regent's hopes of an Anglo-French alliance which might finally rid Yugoslavia of the constant Italian efforts to undermine national unity.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=473}} When the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939 with the [[German invasion of Poland]], Yugoslavia declared its neutrality.<ref>Hoptner, p. 167</ref> During the \"[[Phoney War]]\", Paul arranged for Yugoslavia to step up deliveries of copper to Germany in exchanges for promises that Germany would finally deliver arms that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance, but which the ''Reich'' kept finding excuses not to deliver.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} Germany also wanted that Yugoslavia not only refuse to join the British-inspired \"peace front\", but also formally align its diplomacy with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=590}} In his sympathies, Paul preferred that France and Britain win the war, but he was markedly afraid of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} Paul repeatedly pressed for a revival of the [[Salonika Front]] strategy of [[First World War]], arguing that if French and British forces landed at Thessaloniki, which would place them in a position to aid Yugoslavia, then he might lean more towards the Allied side.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=78}} During the Phony War, a popular, if erroneous rumor in Croatia that Paul was planning to enter the war on the Allied side and send Croat regiments to man the [[Maginot Line]] in France increased support for Croat separatism.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=142}}\n\nOn 25 March 1941, the [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslav government signed]] the Axis [[Tripartite Pact]], with significant reservations, as three notes were appended. The first note obliged the Axis powers to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia. In the second note the Axis powers promised not to ask Yugoslavia for any military assistance, and in the third they promised not to ask permission to move military forces across Yugoslav territory during the war.<ref>Hoptner, p. 240</ref> Nonetheless, the signing of the pact did not sit well with several elements of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. On 27 March 1941, two days after Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, Yugoslav military figures with British support [[Yugoslav coup of 1941|forcibly removed Paul from power]] and declared King Peter II of age.<ref>Hoptner, p. 266</ref> German and Italian forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded the country]] ten days later.\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia.png|thumb|upright|Paul's coat of arms]]\nFor the remainder of the war, Prince Paul was kept, with his family, under [[house arrest]] by the British in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. His sister-in-law the [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] and her husband the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke]], appealed to [[Winston Churchill]], hoping he would allow Paul and his wife, [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark|Princess Olga]], to take refuge in Britain. However, Churchill rejected the request in no uncertain manner; he viewed Paul as a traitor and war criminal. After the Duke of Kent's death in 1942, Churchill relented to King George's insistence and allowed Olga to fly to London to comfort her sister\u2013although without her husband, who had been extremely close to the late Duke.<ref>{{Cite journal| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-princess-paul-of-yugoslavia-1291926.html| title=Obituary: Princess Paul of Yugoslavia|journal=The Independent|date=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=Theo |date=2014 |title=The Royal Family at War |location= |publisher=Thistle Publishing |pages=204, 205}}</ref>\n\nThe post-war [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist authorities in Yugoslavia]] had Prince Paul proclaimed an enemy of the state, barred him from ever returning to Yugoslavia, and confiscated all of his property in Yugoslavia. He died in Paris on 14 September 1976, aged 83<ref>''The Times'', Thursday, 16 September 1976, p. 16</ref> and was buried at the [[Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery]] in [[Switzerland]].\n\n[[Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia|Princess Elizabeth]], his only daughter, obtained information from the British [[Special Operations Executive]] files in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] in London and published them in Belgrade, in the 1990 edition of the Serbian-language biography of her father. The original book ''Paul of Yugoslavia: Britain's Maligned Friend'' was written by Neil Balfour, the first was published by Eaglet Publishing in London in 1980.\n\nPrince Paul was rehabilitated by the Serbian courts in 2011 and on 6 October 2012 was reburied at the family crypt of [[Oplenac]], near [[Topola]] in central Serbia, together with his wife Olga and son [[Prince Nikola of Yugoslavia (1928\u20131954)|Nikola]].<ref>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-to-repatriate-its-royal-family Balkaninsight]</ref>\n\nPrince Paul was the father of [[Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia|Princess Elizabeth]], [[Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia the Elder|Prince Alexander]], and [[Prince Nikola of Yugoslavia (1928\u20131954)|Prince Nikola]], and was the grandfather of the American author [[Christina Oxenberg]] and American actress [[Catherine Oxenberg]].\n\n==Art collections==\nPrince Paul, together with [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] collected, donated and dedicated a large number of art works to Serbia and the Serbian people, including foreign masterpieces. There are especially significant Italian, French and Dutch/Flemish pieces.

For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which [[coccolithophores]], single-celled [[alga]]e with small [[calcite]] skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today.\n\nOverlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of [[clay-with-flints]]. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by [[cryoturbation]] and decalcification of the chalk.<ref name=Gallois>{{cite journal |last1=Gallois |first1= RW |title= The origin of the Clay-with-flints: the missing link|journal=Geoscience in South-West England|date=2009|volume=12|pages=153\u2013161}}</ref> This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.<ref name=Gallois/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Clay-with Flints formation|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=CWF|website=The BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units|publisher=BGS|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Betchworth limekiln - geograph.org.uk - 869914.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Smidth Kiln at [[Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns|Betchworth Quarry]] was constructed in around 1901.<ref name=NHL_Betchworth>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1021346}}</ref>]]\nThe sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the [[Quaternary]].

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artificial intelligence]] named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Westworld (season 2)|second season]], which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020.\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates one of several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William Delos tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with supposedly several host cores, including Bernard's, however as revealed in Season 3, they were all copies of Dolores' core. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body, Bernard's host copy and host copies of possibly 5 humans with her copied cores (from Season 2) essential for her plan. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores).

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artifical intelligence]] named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Westworld (season 2)|second season]], which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020.\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates one of several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William Delos tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with supposedly several host cores, including Bernard's, however as revealed in Season 3, they were all copies of Dolores' core. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body, Bernard's host copy and host copies of possibly 5 humans with her copied cores (from Season 2) essential for her plan. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence.
