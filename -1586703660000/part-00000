It was released on December 9, 1997, for [[Def Jam Recordings]] and was produced by LL Cool J and [[Erick Sermon]]. A remix was made with an additional verse from  American southern [[hip hop]] artist [[Master P]]. Both the original song (without Canibus) and the remix (with Canibus and Master P) had accompanying music videos. The song peaked at number 75 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 10 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]] and number 24 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]].\n\n==LL Cool J vs. Canibus==\nThe song is notable for starting the LL Cool J vs. Canibus feud, LL took offense to the lines, \"L, is that a mic on your arm? Let me borrow that\", which referenced his tattoo of a microphone on his arm \u2013 and which Canibus claimed was his own way of showing the rap veteran respect \u2013 and wrote an indirect diss to Canibus:\n\n''\"The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers / You hold the rusty sword, I swing the Excalibur\"''\n\nAnd also:\n\n''\"Now let's get back to this mic on my arm / If it ever left my side, it'll transform into a time bomb / You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize / And you don't wanna make me mad, nigga, you wanna socialize.\"''\n\nBefore the song was released, LL Cool J asked Canibus to change his lines. Canibus claims that LL Cool J vowed to modify his own lines as well, but the latter denied this and pointed out that nobody would know who he was talking about if only Canibus's line was changed. The original version eventually leaked, and fans started to piece the lines together. In 1998, Canibus would later respond to the diss with \"[[Second Round K.O.]]\". LL Cool J would then respond to that diss with the \"Ripper Strikes Back\". On his 2000 ''[[G.O.A.T.]]'' album, LL Cool J thanked Canibus for inspiration. In addition, despite appearing on the song, Canibus was omitted from the original music video for the song due to the feud, but was later included in the music video for the remix version.\n\n==Samples==\nThis song features a vocal [[sampling (music)|sample]] from LL Cool J's 1985 song \"[[Rock the Bells (song)|Rock the Bells]]\" off LL's album \"Radio\". Another prominent sample featured in the song is from a [[Beastie Boys|The Beastie Boys]] song \"[[(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)]]\".

The monument is located in the center of [[Thomas Circle]], on the border of the downtown and [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhoods.  It was sculpted by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]], best known for his work on the [[Statue of George Washington (Wall Street)|statue]] of [[George Washington]] in [[Wall Street]], Manhattan.  Attendees at the dedication in 1879 included President [[Rutherford B.

It is considered by art critics and historians to be one of the best equestrian statues in the city.

Employees at the armory were working late and the gate to the vehicle yard, which was completely deserted, was left open.\n\n[[File:American M60A3 tank Lake Charles, Louisiana April 2005.jpg|thumb|left|alt=M60A3 Patton on display in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in April 2005|An M60A3 Patton (the same type of tank Nelson drove) on display in April 2005]]\nThe tanks at the armory started with a push button and did not require an ignition key.

Police agencies involved in the chase included the San Diego police, the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department]], the [[California Highway Patrol]], and due to the tank being stolen from the armory, possibly [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] as well. The tank had a top speed of {{convert|30|mph}}, making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles.

Despite the widespread property destruction, he was the only fatality reported during the rampage.\n\n===Police action===\nQuestions were raised as to whether it was necessary for the police to kill Nelson. Police Captain Tom Hall said that if Nelson had managed to free the tank, he \"could have taken out no less than 35 vehicles that were passing at that moment.\"<ref name=nyt1/> Police decided that if non-lethal action such as [[tear gas]] were used, this might have stopped Nelson, but not the tank, and officers would not be able to enter the tank if it were still mobile with tear gas present. According to live news coverage at the time, officials were seriously considering asking for help from the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] at [[Camp Pendleton]] in the form of a [[Bell AH-1 Cobra]] [[attack helicopter]], as the police force lacked the means for disabling a tank.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://medium.com/of-misdeeds-and-mysteries/the-tank-rampage-of-san-diego-1995-1f8a97a0a30c|title=San Diego\u2019s 1995 Tank Rampage {{!}} Case Closed #2|last=Nicole Henley|date=2019-07-23|work=Medium|access-date=2019-11-28|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128172247/https://medium.com/of-misdeeds-and-mysteries/the-tank-rampage-of-san-diego-1995-1f8a97a0a30c|archive-date=2019-11-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Scott Nelson, when asked, stated that police were justified in shooting his brother.<ref name=latimes1/>\n\n==Armory security==\nOfficials at the armory where Nelson stole the tank were criticized for what appeared to be a huge lapse in security, especially after the attack in Oklahoma City the previous month. In addition to the open, unguarded gate to the vehicle lot, the fence surrounding the lot had damaged [[barbed wire]] in some places. Residents near the armory said that even if the gate had been locked, Nelson could have simply climbed the fence in sections where the barbed wire was damaged. \n\nArmory officials said that only a few people were given keys to the vehicles, that the vehicles were kept far away from fences to make them difficult to reach, that only someone with the proper knowledge could operate and even start a tank, and that there was just no way to foresee such an event taking place.

Employees at the armory were working late and the gate to the vehicle yard, which was completely deserted, was left open.\n\n[[File:American M60A3 tank Lake Charles, Louisiana April 2005.jpg|thumb|left|alt=M60A3 Patton on display in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in April 2005|An M60A3 Patton (the same type of tank Nelson drove) on display in April 2005]]\nThe tanks at the armory started with a push button and did not require an ignition key.

As [[ammunition]] was kept in another building, none of the vehicle's weapons could be loaded or used by Nelson.<ref name=nyt1/>\n\nNelson led police on a 23-minute, televised chase through the streets of Clairemont. Police agencies involved in the chase included the San Diego police, the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department]], the [[California Highway Patrol]], and due to the tank being stolen from the armory, possibly [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] as well. The tank had a top speed of {{convert|30|mph}}, making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles.
