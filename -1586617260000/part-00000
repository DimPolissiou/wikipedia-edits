During the Mughal period of 1556-1764, Umaidpur came under the control of Mir Kasim Ali, the [[Nawab]] of Bengal.\n\nIn 1776, the [[East India Company]] occupied the village. The state sub-division consisted of [[Darbhanga]], [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Munger|Monghyr]], [[Patna]] as a part of the Monghyr district. This area became a part of the Presidency during the [[British Raj]] in 1858.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Umaidpur became a part of the newly created province of [[Bihar]]. The regional office was [[Harsinghpur|Harsingpur]]. Kothi and T.I. Pal was the officer representative on behalf of the British. Throughout British rule, all the villages were part of the estates run by independent [[Zamindar]]s, calling themselves a Raja, or directly ruled by the [[British Raj]].<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_162.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|website=Dsal.uchicago.edu|format=GIF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100424/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_162.gif|archivedate=4 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2018|volume=11}}</ref><ref name=\"Books.google.com\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONw8apR5mVYC&pg=PA249|title=Bihar And Orissa District Gazetteers : Monghyr - L.S.S.

Farming is the main occupation of villagers. There are two brick chimneys in the village. The recent trend has been that many of younger generation are migrating to big cities, such as [[Patna]], [[Mumbai]], [[Surat]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Kolkata]],  looking for employment. As a result of this, the income of individual household has gone up and living standards of individual family have become better.\n\n===Agriculture===\nFrom Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 11, it appears that sugar-cane, indigo and poppy were grown in the land of this and adjacent villages during and before British rule.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> Between 1800 and early nineteenth century, the cultivation of indigo plants ([[Indigofera tinctoria]], also known as I. sumatrana) and [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] (a flowering plant in the subfamily [[Papaveroideae]] of the family [[Papaveraceae]]) was more prevalent. [[Indigo dye]] made in India was exported by British to the Greeks and the Romans, where it was valued as a luxury product. Maharaja of Darbhanga abandoned the cultivation of indigo around 1901, because the fall in the price of [[indigo dye]], due to the competition of artificial substitutes, has caused many other factories to abandon.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> The chief feature of the indigo industry in Umaidpur regions, as compared with the other indigo-growing tracts in North Bihar, was the large area cultivated direct by the factories themselves in the Samastipur subdivision. The plant, when cut, was fermented in masonry vats and oxidized either by beating or by currents of steam. The dye thus precipitated was boiled and dried into cakes. Due to the fall in the value of [[indigo dye]], the factories have taken to the growing of ordinary crops. The principal exports were rice, indigo, gram, pulses, linseed, mustard seed, saltpetre, tobacco, hides, and ghee; and the principal imports were rice and other food-grains, salt, kerosene oil, gunny-bags, coal and coke, European cotton piece-goods, and raw cotton. Gram, pulses, and oilseeds are chiefly sent to Calcutta, and rice and other food-grains to Saran and Muzaffarpur. The imports of food-grains came for the most part from Bhagalpur and Nepal, coal and coke from Burdwary kerosene oil from the Twenty-four Parganas, and salt and piece-goods from Calcutta.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nMost fertile part of the village, use to produce all the most valuable rabi and bhadoi crops. In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 until recently (1980).<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as saliferous land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after rabi crop from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food-grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. Food-crops grown also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate).<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and chilies are cultivated as commercial crops. Of the other non-food crops, kharhaul or thatching-grass was the most valuable, but now these lands are used for growing paddy.\n\n== Governance ==\nUmaidpur became a part of [[Samastipur district]], when [[Darbhanga district]] was split into three districts in 1972. Before British, the mention of this district in the Imperial Gazetteer of India (volume 11) goes back to A. D. 1400.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> When this area was taken over by the British in 1765, it was included in Silbah Bihar and formed with the greater part of [[Muzaffarpur District]], the Sarkar of Tirhut. Bihar was retained as an independent revenue division, and in 1782 Tirhut (including Hajipur) was made into a Collectorate. In 1875 Tirhut was divided into the two existing Districts of [[Muzaffarpur]] and [[Darbhanga]].<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> \nThe governance of the Umiadpur village is run through community development block program administered by a Morwa Block Development Officer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://villageinfo.in/bihar/samastipur/morwa.html|title=List of Villages in Morwa Tehsil|website=Villageinfo.in|accessdate=11 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125134449/https://villageinfo.in/bihar/samastipur/morwa.html|archivedate=25 November 2015}}</ref> Morwa Dakshin Panchayat headed by Mukhiya, and a local administrative unit at the village level.

During the Mughal period of 1556-1764, Umaidpur came under the control of Mir Kasim Ali, the [[Nawab]] of Bengal.\n\nIn 1776, the [[East India Company]] occupied the village. The state sub-division consisted of [[Darbhanga]], [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Munger|Monghyr]], [[Patna]] as a part of the Monghyr district. This area became a part of the Presidency during the [[British Raj]] in 1858.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Umaidpur became a part of the newly created province of [[Bihar]]. The regional office was [[Harsinghpur|Harsingpur]]. Kothi and T.I. Pal was the officer representative on behalf of the British. Throughout British rule, all the villages were part of the estates run by independent [[Zamindar]]s, calling themselves a Raja, or directly ruled by the [[British Raj]].<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_162.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|website=Dsal.uchicago.edu|format=GIF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100424/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_162.gif|archivedate=4 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2018|volume=11}}</ref><ref name=\"Books.google.com\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONw8apR5mVYC&pg=PA249|title=Bihar And Orissa District Gazetteers : Monghyr - L.S.S.

As a result of this, the income of individual household has gone up and living standards of individual family have become better.\n\n===Agriculture===\nFrom Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 11, it appears that sugar-cane, indigo and poppy were grown in the land of this and adjacent villages during and before British rule.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> Between 1800 and early nineteenth century, the cultivation of indigo plants ([[Indigofera tinctoria]], also known as I. sumatrana) and [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] (a flowering plant in the subfamily [[Papaveroideae]] of the family [[Papaveraceae]]) was more prevalent. [[Indigo dye]] made in India was exported by British to the Greeks and the Romans, where it was valued as a luxury product. Maharaja of Darbhanga abandoned the cultivation of indigo around 1901, because the fall in the price of [[indigo dye]], due to the competition of artificial substitutes, has caused many other factories to abandon.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> The chief feature of the indigo industry in Umaidpur regions, as compared with the other indigo-growing tracts in North Bihar, was the large area cultivated direct by the factories themselves in the Samastipur subdivision. The plant, when cut, was fermented in masonry vats and oxidized either by beating or by currents of steam. The dye thus precipitated was boiled and dried into cakes. Due to the fall in the value of [[indigo dye]], the factories have taken to the growing of ordinary crops. The principal exports were rice, indigo, gram, pulses, linseed, mustard seed, saltpetre, tobacco, hides, and ghee; and the principal imports were rice and other food-grains, salt, kerosene oil, gunny-bags, coal and coke, European cotton piece-goods, and raw cotton. Gram, pulses, and oilseeds are chiefly sent to Calcutta, and rice and other food-grains to Saran and Muzaffarpur. The imports of food-grains came for the most part from Bhagalpur and Nepal, coal and coke from Burdwary kerosene oil from the Twenty-four Parganas, and salt and piece-goods from Calcutta.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nMost fertile part of the village, use to produce all the most valuable rabi and bhadoi crops. In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 until recently (1980).<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as saliferous land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after rabi crop from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food-grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. Food-crops grown also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate).<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and chilies are cultivated as commercial crops. Of the other non-food crops, kharhaul or thatching-grass was the most valuable, but now these lands are used for growing paddy.\n\n== Governance ==\nUmaidpur became a part of [[Samastipur district]], when [[Darbhanga district]] was split into three districts in 1972. Before British, the mention of this district in the Imperial Gazetteer of India (volume 11) goes back to A. D. 1400.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> When this area was taken over by the British in 1765, it was included in Silbah Bihar and formed with the greater part of [[Muzaffarpur District]], the Sarkar of Tirhut. Bihar was retained as an independent revenue division, and in 1782 Tirhut (including Hajipur) was made into a Collectorate. In 1875 Tirhut was divided into the two existing Districts of [[Muzaffarpur]] and [[Darbhanga]].<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> \nThe governance of the Umiadpur village is run through community development block program administered by a Morwa Block Development Officer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://villageinfo.in/bihar/samastipur/morwa.html|title=List of Villages in Morwa Tehsil|website=Villageinfo.in|accessdate=11 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125134449/https://villageinfo.in/bihar/samastipur/morwa.html|archivedate=25 November 2015}}</ref> Morwa Dakshin Panchayat headed by Mukhiya, and a local administrative unit at the village level.

It is the second main entry in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and introduced [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], controllable by a second player. In the story, Sonic and Tails must stop series antagonist [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]] from stealing the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to power his [[space station]], the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991. The game was developed by both Japanese and American staff at [[Sega Technical Institute]]. The game was directed by Masaharu Yoshii and produced by [[Shinobu Toyoda]], with game design led by [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] and music composed by [[Masato Nakamura]]. Art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the new 3D special stages based on a [[tech demo]] created by [[Yuji Naka]]. The staff increased the speed of ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' in comparison to its predecessor.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' sold over six million copies, making it the second-bestselling Genesis game behind the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], it received acclaim from critics who commended the game's level design, visuals and music, although its multiplayer mode was criticized. It has been rereleased on various platforms; a remastered version developed using the [[Retro Engine]] released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2013. Two direct sequels, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', were released in 1994.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Aquatic Ruins from Sonic 2 for Mega Drive.png|thumb|left|Sonic and Tails hopping across pillars in the third stage, Aquatic Ruin Zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGNWiiRev\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review |title=''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' Review |accessdate=January 28, 2019 |date=June 11, 2007 |first=Thomas |last=Lucas M. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref> The game stars [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], who is described as having idolized Sonic as a child and wanting to keep up with him.<ref name=\"m3\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3.</ref> At the game's start, the player can select to either play as Sonic, Tails, or both.

After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held at the end of the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings.

However, he cannot jump as high, making some parts of the game, such as certain boss fights, more difficult. In addition, Knuckles restarts with the amount of rings he collected at checkpoints (if he loses a life), the options are unavailable, the special stages have slightly fewer rings required to collect than before (for example, ten rings fewer than in the special stages with Sonic and Tails), and the two-player mode is removed.<ref name=lockon/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's premise is similar to that of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Sonic's nemesis, [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]], is planning world domination through the power of the [[Chaos Emeralds]] and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (an homage to the [[Death Star]]), also for the means of world domination.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe events of the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and eventually up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. The plane is damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant [[mech]]. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic falls to the ground and is saved by Tails in the Tornado.

developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] console, released worldwide in November 1992. It is the second main entry in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and introduced [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], controllable by a second player. In the story, Sonic and Tails must stop series antagonist [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]] from stealing the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to power his [[space station]], the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991. The game was developed by both Japanese and American staff at [[Sega Technical Institute]]. The game was directed by Masaharu Yoshii and produced by [[Shinobu Toyoda]], with game design led by [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] and music composed by [[Masato Nakamura]]. Art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the new 3D special stages based on a [[tech demo]] created by [[Yuji Naka]]. The staff increased the speed of ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' in comparison to its predecessor.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' sold over six million copies, making it the second-bestselling Genesis game behind the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], it received acclaim from critics who commended the game's level design, visuals and music, although its multiplayer mode was criticized. It has been rereleased on various platforms; a remastered version developed using the [[Retro Engine]] released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2013. Two direct sequels, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', were released in 1994.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Aquatic Ruins from Sonic 2 for Mega Drive.png|thumb|left|Sonic and Tails hopping across pillars in the third stage, Aquatic Ruin Zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGNWiiRev\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review |title=''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' Review |accessdate=January 28, 2019 |date=June 11, 2007 |first=Thomas |last=Lucas M. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref> The game stars [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], who is described as having idolized Sonic as a child and wanting to keep up with him.<ref name=\"m3\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3.</ref> At the game's start, the player can select to either play as Sonic, Tails, or both.

A set amount of rings must be collected to pass through each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself. If Sonic collides with a bomb, he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily. The stages rise in difficulty, and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one. After finishing, the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage, with their ring-count reset to zero.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 17.</ref> When all Emeralds have been collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic by collecting 50 rings and jumping.<ref name=gameplay>{{cite web|last1=Creegan|first1=Dermot|title=Casual Monday: Sonic the Hedgehog 2|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/10/27/casual-monday-sonic-the-hedgehog-2/114175/|website=Hardcore Gamer|publisher=Disqus|accessdate=2014-11-16}}</ref><ref name=stages/> Super Sonic is invincible to attacks, runs faster, and jumps further; however, he loses one ring per second and reverts to regular Sonic when his rings are depleted.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\nThe game also has a competitive mode, where two players compete against each other to the finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held at the end of the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent will automatically win.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\n===''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2''===\n{{See also|Sonic &amp; Knuckles}}\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was released in 1994, two years after ''Sonic 2''. The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' [[ROM cartridge|game cartridge]] features a special \"lock-on\" port into which the player can insert other Genesis cartridges. Attaching ''Sonic 2'' unlocks ''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', a variation of ''Sonic 2'' whereby the player plays as [[Knuckles the Echidna]], a character introduced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and not playable until ''Sonic & Knuckles''.<ref name=lockon>{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=James|title=Sonic & Knuckles \"lock-on\" review|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/02/sonic_and_knuckles_virtual_console|website=NintendoLife|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2014-11-14}}</ref> Though the game is largely identical to ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Knuckles is able to glide and climb walls, allowing him access to areas previously inaccessible to Sonic or Tails. However, he cannot jump as high, making some parts of the game, such as certain boss fights, more difficult. In addition, Knuckles restarts with the amount of rings he collected at checkpoints (if he loses a life), the options are unavailable, the special stages have slightly fewer rings required to collect than before (for example, ten rings fewer than in the special stages with Sonic and Tails), and the two-player mode is removed.<ref name=lockon/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's premise is similar to that of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Sonic's nemesis, [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]], is planning world domination through the power of the [[Chaos Emeralds]] and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (an homage to the [[Death Star]]), also for the means of world domination.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe events of the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and eventually up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. The plane is damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant [[mech]]. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic falls to the ground and is saved by Tails in the Tornado. If the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic, in his [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] form, flies alongside it.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the release of the original ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', creator [[Yuji Naka]] quit [[Sega]] due to disagreements over corporate policy.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\">{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/06/developers-den-sega-technical-institute/|title=Developer's Den: Sega Technical Institute|work=Sega-16|date=2007-06-11|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref><ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|title=The Essential 50 Part 28 - Sonic the Hedgehog|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523204203/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|archivedate=May 23, 2011|accessdate=2014-07-21|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Mark Cerny]], who had recently founded [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI) in California, met with Naka in Japan and offered him a higher salary and more creative freedom if he joined STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Naka agreed, and [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]], the lead level designer of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', also decided to move to STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Yasuhara had been assigned to help Cerny establish STI in 1990, but the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]] delayed his move to the United States by three months, during which he joined [[Sonic Team]] and became part of the original ''Sonic'' project.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\">{{cite magazine|title=Sonic's Architect: GI Interviews Hirokazu Yasuhara|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=124|volume=13|date=August 2003|pages=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|title=Birth of a Hedgehog|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=211|volume=20|date=January 2007|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|page=72}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic 2'' began in November 1991, two months later than Cerny had intended because Sega of America initially felt it was too soon for a sequel.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\" /> STI handled development;<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"gibehind\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=The Behind-The-Scenes Story Of How Sonic 2 Became Sega\u2019s Ace In The Hole|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/11/21/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-how-sonic-2-became-sega-ace-in-the-hole.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wrong\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=Where Sonic Went Wrong|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/11/09/where-sonic-went-wrong.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 14, 2006}}</ref> both American and Japanese staff contributed, although, according to team member Tim Skelly, \"Everyone attached to ''Sonic 2'' ultimately worked for Yuji Naka.
