The administration has also been criticized for refusing to back various security measures relating to port security in 2003 and 2004 and vetoing all [[United States dollar|US$]]39 million for the 2002 [[Container Security Initiative]].\n\n== Diversity and civil rights ==\n=== Faith-based initiatives ===\n\nIn early 2001, [[George W.

During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of [[gay rights]] legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a first for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm National Lesbian and Gay Task Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050611081519/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm |date=2005-06-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn his first four years of office, his views on [[gay rights]] were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401496.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays | first=Christopher | last=Lee | date=2005-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> He did not attempt to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell]], nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the [[Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007|Matthew Shepard Act]], which would have included [[sexual orientation]] in hate crimes.\n\nWhile President Bush had always been on record as opposing the [[legal]] recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on \"value issues\" such as a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told [[ABC News]] and [[Larry King]] that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of [[civil unions]] legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.\n\nBush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 [[State of the Union]] address\nand during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.\n\nBush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]], as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position |first=Christopher |last=Heredia |date=2001-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524151549/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2001%2F04%2F10%2FMN198145.DTL |url-status=dead |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}</ref> In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E.

Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.\n\nIn August 2005, a report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] states that \"the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/2005/0818list.htm|title=U.S. Commission on Civil Rights - FOIA|author=|date=|website=www.usccr.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Chairman [[Gerald A.

Bollinger]].\n\nIn his first term, Bush appointed [[Colin Powell]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Powell was the first [[African-American]] man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by [[Condoleezza Rice]]: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed [[Alberto Gonzales]] as the [[United States Attorney General]], the first [[Hispanic]] to hold that position.\n\nBush met with the [[National Urban League]], the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well.\n\n===Genetic Non-Discrimination===\nPresident George W.

The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign.<ref>http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/8572141.htm?1c</ref> Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.\n\nSupporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from [[NASA]]'s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.\n\n[[File:BUSHOVALWTC.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

Another subject of controversy is Bush's [[Clear Skies Initiative]], which seeks to reduce [[air pollution]] through expansion of [[emissions trading]].\n\nBush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up [[pollution]] and contaminated sediment in the [[Great Lakes]], as well as the [[Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act|Brownfields Legislation]] in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or [[Brownfield land|brownfields]], to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities.\n\nBush stated his reason for not supporting the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially [[China]] and [[India]]. Bush stated, \"The world's second-largest emitter of [[greenhouse gases]] is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.\"\n\nBush also questioned the science behind the [[global warming]] phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010611-2.html|title=President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change|author=|date=|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{further|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n==== Global warming ====\n{{main|Climate change policy of the George W.

Bush administration}}\n[[File:BushCAGovs.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush speaks to firefighters on November 4, 2003, as California Governor-Elect [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Governor [[Gray Davis]] listen.]]\nAccording to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the economy suffered from a [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] that lasted from March 2001 to November 2001. During the Bush Administration, Real [[GDP]] has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title = Gross Domestic Product|publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate = 2007-07-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2-3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] have caused concern about increasing inflation.\n\nLong-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s. Under the Bush administration, productivity has grown by an average of 3.76% per year, the highest such average in ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/prod_nr.htm|title=Productivity and Costs Archived News Releases :  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile the GDP recovered from a recession that some claim Bush inherited from the previous administration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7089700|title=Did Bush 'inherit' a recession?|author=|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] has since worsened according to the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]].

Although the poverty level increased the increase was still lower from 2000 to 2002 than it was from 1992 to 1997, which reached a peak of 39.3% in 1993. In 2002 the poverty rate was 34.6% which was almost equal to the rate in 1998, which was 34.5%. Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== Taxes ===\nPresident Bush won passage for two major [[tax cut]]s during his term in office: The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]]. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \"[[Bush tax cuts]]\".\n\nThe cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard [[Standard deduction|income tax deduction]] for married couples, eliminated the [[estate tax]], and reduced [[marginal tax rate]]s. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.\n\nBush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid%3D21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084200/http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=21 |archivedate=2005-12-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Bush visits NSA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national [[Economic surplus|surplus]] into a historically large [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].\n\nIn an open letter to Bush in 2004, more than 100 professors of business and economics at U.S. business schools ascribed this \"fiscal reversal\" to Bush's \"policy of slashing taxes - primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yubanet.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/13/14283|title=1,325 Kids in Nevada County Risk Summer Hunger - YubaNet - Page 14283|first=California Food Policy|last=Advocates|date=|website=www.yubanet.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, these cuts had reduced federal tax revenues, as a percentage of the [[Gross Domestic Product]], to the lowest level since 1959.

In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection \"omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year \u2014 and possibly for some time to come \u2014 for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]].\" The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts \"will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.\" If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then \"the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.\" Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.\n\nFederal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years.

[[Tariffs]] on imported [[steel]] imposed by the White House in March 2002 were lifted after the [[World Trade Organization]] ruled them illegal.

From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending \"crisis\". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax ([[FICA tax|FICA]]) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.\n\nMost Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the [[United Kingdom]]'s privatized pension plan. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]]. In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.\n\n== Capital punishment ==\nGeorge W.

The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003. As a result, the [[National Prison Rape Elimination Commission]] was created to study the problem and recommend solutions. Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding. New grants to prevent sexual assault were also created by the law. Significant support for the act came from [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Concerned Women for America]], Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2005\u201306, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of renewable sources of energy such as [[hydrogen power]], [[nuclear power]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], and [[clean coal|clean coal technologies]]. Bush proposed the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]] which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. In the 2007 State of the Union speech, President Bush proposed a 20:10 policy, where, as a nation, the United States would be working to reduce 20% of the national energy usage in next 10 years by converting to ethanol.\n\n=== Tariffs ===\nBush's imposition of a [[United States steel tariff 2002|tariff on imported steel]] and [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute|on Canadian softwood lumber]] was controversial in light of his advocacy of [[free market]] [[policies]] in other areas. The steel tariff was later rescinded under pressure from the [[World Trade Organization]].

The administration has also been criticized for refusing to back various security measures relating to port security in 2003 and 2004 and vetoing all [[United States dollar|US$]]39 million for the 2002 [[Container Security Initiative]].\n\n== Diversity and civil rights ==\n=== Faith-based initiatives ===\n\nIn early 2001, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] worked with Republicans in Congress to pass [[legislation]] changing the way the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] [[regulation|regulated]], taxed and funded [[charities]] and non-profit initiatives run by [[religion|religious]] [[organizations]]. Although prior to the legislation it was possible for these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the [[White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/fbci/|title=Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|author=|date=|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations.

Texas]]''. During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of [[gay rights]] legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a first for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm National Lesbian and Gay Task Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050611081519/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm |date=2005-06-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn his first four years of office, his views on [[gay rights]] were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401496.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays | first=Christopher | last=Lee | date=2005-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> He did not attempt to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell]], nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the [[Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007|Matthew Shepard Act]], which would have included [[sexual orientation]] in hate crimes.\n\nWhile President Bush had always been on record as opposing the [[legal]] recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on \"value issues\" such as a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told [[ABC News]] and [[Larry King]] that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of [[civil unions]] legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.\n\nBush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 [[State of the Union]] address\nand during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.\n\nBush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]], as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position |first=Christopher |last=Heredia |date=2001-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524151549/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2001%2F04%2F10%2FMN198145.DTL |url-status=dead |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}</ref> In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E.

Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.\n\nIn August 2005, a report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] states that \"the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/2005/0818list.htm|title=U.S. Commission on Civil Rights - FOIA|author=|date=|website=www.usccr.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Chairman [[Gerald A. Reynolds]] explained, \"Federal agencies do not independently evaluate, conduct research, collect data, or periodically review programs to determine whether race-neutral strategies will provide an adequate alternative to race-conscious programs.\" Civil rights groups expressed concern that the report was an attack on affirmative action inconsistent with [[Grutter v. Bollinger]].\n\nIn his first term, Bush appointed [[Colin Powell]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Powell was the first [[African-American]] man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by [[Condoleezza Rice]]: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed [[Alberto Gonzales]] as the [[United States Attorney General]], the first [[Hispanic]] to hold that position.\n\nBush met with the [[National Urban League]], the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well.\n\n===Genetic Non-Discrimination===\nPresident George W.

Bush|President Bush]] supported adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. However, Bush opposed any new embryonic [[stem cell research]], and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] on January 19, 1999,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published.

The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign.<ref>http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/8572141.htm?1c</ref> Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.\n\nSupporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from [[NASA]]'s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.\n\n[[File:BUSHOVALWTC.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

It is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century and the calling of our generation.\".]]\n\nIn January 2005, the White House released a new Space Transportation Policy fact sheet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ostp.gov/html/SpaceTransFactSheetJan2005.pdf|title=Office of Science and Technology Policy|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> which outlined the administration's space policy in broad terms and tied the development of space transport capabilities to national security requirements.\n\n=== Environment ===\n{{further|Environmental policy of the United States#The George W.

Another subject of controversy is Bush's [[Clear Skies Initiative]], which seeks to reduce [[air pollution]] through expansion of [[emissions trading]].\n\nBush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up [[pollution]] and contaminated sediment in the [[Great Lakes]], as well as the [[Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act|Brownfields Legislation]] in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or [[Brownfield land|brownfields]], to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities.\n\nBush stated his reason for not supporting the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially [[China]] and [[India]]. Bush stated, \"The world's second-largest emitter of [[greenhouse gases]] is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.\"\n\nBush also questioned the science behind the [[global warming]] phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010611-2.html|title=President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change|author=|date=|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{further|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n==== Global warming ====\n{{main|Climate change policy of the George W.

During the Bush Administration, Real [[GDP]] has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title = Gross Domestic Product|publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate = 2007-07-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2-3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] have caused concern about increasing inflation.\n\nLong-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s.

Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== Taxes ===\nPresident Bush won passage for two major [[tax cut]]s during his term in office: The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]]. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \"[[Bush tax cuts]]\".\n\nThe cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard [[Standard deduction|income tax deduction]] for married couples, eliminated the [[estate tax]], and reduced [[marginal tax rate]]s. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.\n\nBush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid%3D21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084200/http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=21 |archivedate=2005-12-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Bush visits NSA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

The CBO noted, however, that this projection \"omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year \u2014 and possibly for some time to come \u2014 for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]].\" The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts \"will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.\" If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then \"the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.\" Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.\n\nFederal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years.

The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that the percentage of the population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%.

Bush Omaha panel (cropped).jpg|thumb|Shortly after his second inauguration, Bush (here seen with a panel in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) toured the nation to promote his proposal for [[Social Security (United States)]] personal accounts.]]\n{{main|Social Security debate (United States)}}\nBush is an advocate of the partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] wherein an individual would be free to invest a portion of his Social Security taxes in personal retirement accounts.\n\nBush has called for major changes in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], identifying the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending \"crisis\". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax ([[FICA tax|FICA]]) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.\n\nMost Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the [[United Kingdom]]'s privatized pension plan. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]]. In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.\n\n== Capital punishment ==\nGeorge W. Bush is a strong supporter of [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were [[capital punishment in Texas|executed in that state]], maintaining its record as the leading state in [[execution (legal)|executions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/01/13/death-in-texas/|title=Death in Texas|first=Sister Helen|last=Prejean|date=29 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.nybooks.com}}</ref> As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist [[Timothy McVeigh]].

Darth Vader, in his previous identity as Anakin Skywalker, is a lead character in the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film trilogy]].

The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill a young Han's paper work to join the Imperial Flight Academy, and help him avoid jail.

In this film, [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] discovers Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin as slaves on the planet [[Tatooine]]. Qui-Gon finds that Anakin has a higher count of [[midi-chlorians]] (Force-imparting microorganisms) than any Jedi, even [[Yoda]], counting to about 20,000. Shmi informs Qui-Gon that Anakin has no father, leading Qui-Gon to suggest that Anakin is a product of midi-chlorians, an example of a [[miraculous birth]]. As the film progresses, Anakin leaves Tatooine to begin his Jedi training.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' reveals that, in Anakin's absence, Shmi has married [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Cliegg Lars]], becoming the stepmother of [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Owen]]. Owen tells Anakin they are stepbrothers. Owen later marries [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Beru Whitesun]]. The [[Jedi Order]] had a strict celibacy requirement, which Anakin secretly broke as a Jedi Knight, after he secretly married Naboo Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' Padme dies giving birth to twins, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]]. Luke is raised by Beru and Owen Lars on Tatooine. Leia is raised by Senator [[Bail Organa]] and Queen [[Breha Organa]] on [[Alderaan (Star Wars)|Alderaan]]. Neither of the twins know of each other's existence, Luke knows his birth last-name but is told his father Anakin is dead, Leia isn't told her last-name. Anakin who became the Sith Lord, known as Darth Vader, is never told his children were born.\n\nIn ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', it is revealed that Han Solo's birth name is not Han Solo. It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corelia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his parent worked in a space-ship factory in Corelia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill Han's paper work so Han could join the Imperial Flight Academy. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo. By ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', Han Solo deflected the Empire and became a smuggler, and later joins the [[Rebel Alliance]], where he meets Leia and Luke (who in that film meet for the first time, and they don't learn they're siblings until ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' it is revealed that Leia is married to [[Han Solo]]. Leia and Han have a son named [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo, who later adopts the name Kylo Ren]]. The family breaks apart following Ben's descent into the dark side, with Leia and Han separating, and Luke disappearing to the planet [[Ahch-To]]. Luke hasn't been revealed to have any children; a possible reason for this could be the celibacy rules of the Jedi. At the end of ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', all blood-related members of the Skywalker bloodline have seemingly died out, as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo dies and fades into the force. Later, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as a surname when asked her name by a [[Tatooine]] local in a way to cut ties with her Palpatine lineage and honor the ones she truly consider as her family.\n\n{{Skywalker family tree}}\n<br />\n\n===Shmi Skywalker-Lars===\nShmi Skywalker, portrayed by [[Pernilla August]], is the mother of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], paternal grandmother to [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] and maternal great-grandmother to [[Kylo Ren]]. Her first name is derived from [[Lakshmi]], a [[Hindu]] [[goddess]]. She appears in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''.\n\nIn ''The Phantom Menace'', she and her son are introduced as [[Slavery|slave]]s of junk merchant [[Watto]] on the desert world [[Tatooine]].<ref>''[[Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace]]'' script</ref> She welcomes [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) into their home, and tells him that Anakin ([[Jake Lloyd]]) has no father; she simply [[Parthenogenesis|became]] [[miraculous births|pregnant]] with him. In spite of her poverty, Shmi tries to give Anakin a good home in the slave quarter of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.\n\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'', Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]), now a young adult [[Jedi]] apprentice, senses through [[the Force]] that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer [[Minor residents of Tatooine#Lars, Cliegg|Cliegg Lars]] ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]), but had recently been abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]]. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but it's too late\u2014beaten and [[torture]]d beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged, Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children. His mother's death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path to becoming [[Darth Vader]].\n\n===Anakin Skywalker===\n{{Main|Darth Vader}}\nAnakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker and she told him he was born without a father through the Force. He is the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren. Anakin is discovered on [[Tatooine]] by Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] who is sure that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi Prophecy, who will bring balance to the Force. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close bond with [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], the young senator of [[Naboo]]. The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the boy's progress \"with great interest\" and advise him. Torn between his loyalty to the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes Darth Vader, willing to protect his loved ones especially Padme. As Darth Vader, Anakin spends the following decades serving under Palpatine's Galactic Empire until reuniting with his son, Luke, redeeming himself by defeating his master to protect him while sacrificing himself in the process.\n\n===Padm\u00e9 Amidala===\n{{Main|Padm\u00e9 Amidala}}\nThe secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, and mother of Luke and Leia and maternal grandmother of Kylo Ren. She served as Queen of Naboo, and later as a Senator for her planet. Her closest friend in the Senate was Senator [[Bail Organa]]. She reconnected and fell in love with Anakin Skywalker after he was assigned to protect her from an assassination attempt, and secretly married him shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Three years later, she reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant and plans to raise their child on Naboo. She realizes that Anakin has started to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth and assures him that it was just a dream and that it won\u2019t happen. After Anakin turned to the dark side and massacred the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, she was told by Anakin that the Jedi had taken over the Republic. Obi-Wan arrives and asks Padm\u00e9 about her husband's whereabouts and informs her that he has turned to the dark side. Padm\u00e9 accuses Obi-Wan of lying and doesn\u2019t believe that Anakin would kill younglings. Obi-Wan states that Anakin is the father of Padm\u00e9\u2019s child and sets off to find him. Padm\u00e9 tracks Anakin, now [[Darth Vader]], to Mustafar but when she tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side, Vader refuses and force chokes her unconscious when Obi-Wan arrives. Padm\u00e9 gives birth to her children shortly after the first Empire Day. Before she dies, Padm\u00e9 assures Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin, before passing away. Obi-Wan and Yoda decided to separate the children in order to keep them hidden from Darth Vader.\n\n===Luke Skywalker===\n\n{{main|Luke Skywalker}}\nLuke Skywalker is the son of Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Senator of Naboo, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. He is taken in by his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padm\u00e9 and Anakin's fall to the dark side. He is Force-sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In ''Return of the Jedi'', a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader (previously Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke's belief that Vader's claim to fatherhood in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan's [[Force Ghost]] that Princess Leia Organa is his sister. In ''The Force Awakens'', as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding after failing to prevent his nephew and apprentice Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the dark side to join [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and has cut himself off from the Force. In ''The Last Jedi'', a young scavenger named [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] has located Luke and tries to convince him to show her the ways of the Force, but he refuses. After knowing the death of Han Solo, he trains Rey about how to use the Force and to become a Jedi. Luke reveals to Rey that he sensed the dark side in Ben and was scared for him, but Ben retaliated by using the Force to collapse the Jedi Temple and leaves him. When he refuses to help Rey turn Ben back to the light, Luke plans to burn the Jedi Temple tree and is greeted by Yoda, who convinces him to help Rey and not to mourn his failure of losing Ben to Snoke. On the planet Crait, Luke appears with his old lightsaber and duels Ben, who tries to attack Luke, but he dodges them. Luke tries to reason with Ben and then disappears, revealing that he was still on the island and that Ben was dueling a Force projection of him. Luke falls to the ground and gets up, and afterwards dies after disappearing, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Leia Organa===\n\n{{Main|Princess Leia}}\nThe daughter of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[Leia Amidala Skywalker]] raised by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hidalgo |first=Pablo |title=Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |date=2016 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taVyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20}}</ref> At age 19 she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the [[Tantive IV]] [[blockade runner]] on a so-called \"diplomatic mission\". Leia is shown to be Force-sensitive. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Leia professes her love for [[Han Solo]] when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', planning to feed Luke, Han, and [[Chewbacca]] to the flesh eating [[Sarlacc]], [[Jabba the Hutt]] is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order.  She married Han Solo and had a son named [[Ben Solo]], later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of ''The Force Awakens''.

He initially trains to be a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Soon, Luke suspects Ben has been influenced by Snoke, and ignites his lightsaber near Ben while he is sleeping in an attempt to kill him. This causes Ben to fall to the dark side. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, working for the First Order and working under the influence of [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and also forms an uneasy alliance with [[General Hux]]. He is obsessed with the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and aspires to finish what Vader started: the elimination of the Jedi. He stabs Han Solo, his father, in the heart but spares his mother when ordered to destroy her ship. Ben becoming Kylo Ren also caused Han and Leia to break up, with neither of them able to stop loving their son. Luke confronts him and also disappears trying to stop Ben's actions. After his mother's death, he turns to the light side becoming Ben Solo again. Later, he dies to bring [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] back to life, ending the Skywalker bloodline.\n\n.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{chart top|Skywalker family tree}}\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | PAR | ||PAR=Shmi Skywalker's Parents}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{tree chart|CLIEG|~| SHM | | | | ||CLIEG=Cliegg Lars|SHM=Shmi Skywalker Lars}}\n{{tree chart| |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{tree chart|OWN| | ANI |y|PADME| |ORGf||OWN=Owen Lars|ANI=[[Anakin Skywalker]]|PADME=[[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]|ORGf=House of Organa}}\n{{tree chart| |:| | | | | |!| | | | | |:| | |}}\n{{tree chart| |L|~|~|7|,|-|^|-|.|F|~|~|J| | |}}\n{{tree chart| | | | |LUKEs| |LEIAs|y|HAN| | | ||LUKEs=[[Luke Skywalker]]|HAN=[[Han Solo]]|LEIAs=[[Leia Organa]]|}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | | |REY| |SOLOf| | | | | ||REY=[[Rey Skywalker]]<br />(honorary)|SOLOf=[[Ben Solo]]}}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==''Legends''==\nThe following characters are exclusive to what is now retroactively known as the ''Legends'' brand since April 2014, and non-canonical to any and all ''Star Wars'' material produced under the ownership of the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> With the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.<ref name=\"THR Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Adult\"/>\n\nA further complication in this continuity is the fact that the ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' novelization includes a detail about Owen Lars being Obi-Wan Kenobi's estranged brother (rather than the son of a previous marriage, of the man who married Anakin's mother).<ref>{{cite book|title=Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|first=James|last=Kahn|publisher=Del-Rey|isbn=0-345-30767-4|year=1983}}</ref> To explain subsequent references,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jedi Apprentice: The Hidden Past|first=Jude|last=Watson|publisher=Scholastic|isbn=0590519336|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/hiddenpast00wats}}</ref> ''Star Wars: Lone Wolf: A Tale of Obi-Wan and Luke''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2|title=Rare Clone Wars Comics and Literature|publisher=Starwars.com|accessdate=2015-12-24|archivedate=2015-10-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016031555/http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2}}</ref> introduces \"Owen Kenobi\", a personification of the bond Kenobi feels toward Owen Lars.\n\nThe Skywalker bloodline branches from Luke and Leia's descendants, but only Luke's side continues to carry the Skywalker name.\n\n===Luke's descendants in ''Legends''===\nIn the non-canon 'Star Wars Legends' timeline, Luke has one son, named Ben in honor of Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi.\n\n====Mara Jade====\n{{Main|Mara Jade}}\nLuke marries [[Mara Jade]], and they have a son named [[List of Star Wars characters#S|Ben]].\n\n====Ben Skywalker====\nLuke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker's son.

'''Anakin Solo''' is the youngest child born to [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa Skywalker]], and the younger brother of Jacen and Jaina Solo.\n\nAnakin appears as an infant and toddler in many ''Star Wars'' novels such as the [[Jedi Academy trilogy|''Jedi Academy'' trilogy]] (1994). Anakin and his siblings play central roles in other novels such as ''[[The Crystal Star]]'' (1994), the [[Corellian trilogy|''Corellian'' trilogy]] (1995) and ''[[The New Rebellion]]'' (1996). Anakin's birth is featured in [[Tom Veitch]]'s ''[[Dark Empire II]]'' comic book miniseries (May 1995). He is first referred to as Han Solo, Jr. by his father, but Leia corrects him, having named the baby after her biological father, [[Anakin Skywalker]], as a reminder of hope.

Anakin was now an eleven-year-old child starting his training at the [[Jedi Academy]] on [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Golden Globe\"/> Richardson continued Anakin's adventures in the following two novels, ''Lyric's World'' and ''Promises'', before [[Rebecca Moesta]] finished the series with ''Anakin's Quest'', ''Vader's Fortress'', and ''Kenobi's Blade'', starting in 1996.  Anakin appears in the ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and Rebecca Moesta, which follows the adventures of Anakin's siblings, Jacen and Jaina.\n\nIn 1999, the first novel of the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series was published, entitled ''[[Vector Prime]]'' by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. Anakin is now a teenager studying as a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]], debating with his brother, Jacen, on the ways of a Jedi and the Force. In the novel's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], his father's co-pilot and best friend, [[Chewbacca]], dies saving Anakin's life.\n\nAnakin plays major roles in ''[[Dark Tide: Onslaught]]'' and ''[[Dark Tide: Ruin]]'' by [[Michael A.

Writers of the ''New Jedi Order'' storyline revealed in a question-and-answer section of the paperback edition of ''[[The Unifying Force]]'' published on August 3, 2004 that Anakin was supposed to be the hero of the story and lead the Jedi Order, but this was changed due to the release of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel films]], in which the hero was also named ''Anakin''. Instead, he dies in battle at the conclusion of the novel.\n\nEven after Anakin's death, he has been mentioned several times in most following novels, including a possible appearance in ''[[Traitor (Star Wars novel)|Traitor]]'' by [[Matthew Stover]], as a [[Droid (Star Wars)|droid]] in ''[[Betrayal (Star Wars novel)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Aaron Allston]] as Anakin Sal-Solo and in ''[[Backlash (Star Wars novel)|Backlash]]'', where he appeared to his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker and to Luke's son, [[Ben Skywalker]] by [[Aaron Allston]].\n\nAnakin is portrayed in the earlier books as being a genius and a loner, but is haunted by his name.  In ''Lyric's World'', it is revealed that he loves to take computers apart and put them back together and sees it as a puzzle.<ref>Richardson, N. ''Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World.''

[[Luke Skywalker]], his twin sister [[Princess Leia]], and their father [[Darth Vader]] are central characters in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' film trilogy]]. Darth Vader, in his previous identity as Anakin Skywalker, is a lead character in the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film trilogy]].

It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corellia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his father worked in a space-ship factory in Corellia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill a young Han's paper work to join the Imperial Flight Academy, and help him avoid jail. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo, and since his only known child was with Leia (a Skywalker), all members of the [[Solo family]] are part of the Skywalker family.\n\nAt the end of ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'', [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as her [[surname]], despite being the granddaughter of [[Emperor Palpatine]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McCluskey |first=Megan |title=Breaking Down That Shocking Rey Reveal in ''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker'' |url=https://time.com/5752170/who-are-reys-parents/ |work=[[Time (magazine) |Time]] |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref> \n\nSince the 2000s Prequel Trilogy, and according to the 2018 comic book ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'' written by [[Charles Soule]] and [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]], [[Shmi Skywalker]]'s impregnation was the result of [[Sheev Palpatine]] influencing the force to do so, making Emperor Palpatine the ancestor to [[Anakin Skywalker]].

In this film, [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] discovers Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin as slaves on the planet [[Tatooine]]. Qui-Gon finds that Anakin has a higher count of [[midi-chlorians]] (Force-imparting microorganisms) than any Jedi, even [[Yoda]], counting to about 20,000. Shmi informs Qui-Gon that Anakin has no father, leading Qui-Gon to suggest that Anakin is a product of midi-chlorians, an example of a [[miraculous birth]]. As the film progresses, Anakin leaves Tatooine to begin his Jedi training.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' reveals that, in Anakin's absence, Shmi has married [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Cliegg Lars]], becoming the stepmother of [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Owen]]. Owen tells Anakin they are stepbrothers. Owen later marries [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Beru Whitesun]]. The [[Jedi Order]] had a strict celibacy requirement, which Anakin secretly broke as a Jedi Knight, after he secretly married Naboo Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' Padme dies giving birth to twins, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]]. Luke is raised by Beru and Owen Lars on Tatooine. Leia is raised by Senator [[Bail Organa]] and Queen [[Breha Organa]] on [[Alderaan (Star Wars)|Alderaan]]. Neither of the twins know of each other's existence, Luke knows his birth last-name but is told his father Anakin is dead, Leia isn't told her last-name. Anakin who became the Sith Lord, known as Darth Vader, is never told his children were born.\n\nIn ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', it is revealed that Han Solo's birth name is not Han Solo. It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corelia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his parent worked in a space-ship factory in Corelia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill Han's paper work so Han could join the Imperial Flight Academy. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo. By ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', Han Solo deflected the Empire and became a smuggler, and later joins the [[Rebel Alliance]], where he meets Leia and Luke (who in that film meet for the first time, and they don't learn they're siblings until ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' it is revealed that Leia is married to [[Han Solo]]. Leia and Han have a son named [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo, who later adopts the name Kylo Ren]]. The family breaks apart following Ben's descent into the dark side, with Leia and Han separating, and Luke disappearing to the planet [[Ahch-To]]. Luke hasn't been revealed to have any children; a possible reason for this could be the celibacy rules of the Jedi. At the end of ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', all blood-related members of the Skywalker bloodline have seemingly died out, as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo dies and fades into the force. Later, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as a surname when asked her name by a [[Tatooine]] local in a way to cut ties with her Palpatine lineage and honor the ones she truly consider as her family.\n\n{{Skywalker family tree}}\n<br />\n\n===Shmi Skywalker-Lars===\nShmi Skywalker, portrayed by [[Pernilla August]], is the mother of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], paternal grandmother to [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] and maternal great-grandmother to [[Kylo Ren]]. Her first name is derived from [[Lakshmi]], a [[Hindu]] [[goddess]]. She appears in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''.\n\nIn ''The Phantom Menace'', she and her son are introduced as [[Slavery|slave]]s of junk merchant [[Watto]] on the desert world [[Tatooine]].<ref>''[[Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace]]'' script</ref> She welcomes [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) into their home, and tells him that Anakin ([[Jake Lloyd]]) has no father; she simply [[Parthenogenesis|became]] [[miraculous births|pregnant]] with him. In spite of her poverty, Shmi tries to give Anakin a good home in the slave quarter of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.\n\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'', Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]), now a young adult [[Jedi]] apprentice, senses through [[the Force]] that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer [[Minor residents of Tatooine#Lars, Cliegg|Cliegg Lars]] ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]), but had recently been abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]]. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but it's too late\u2014beaten and [[torture]]d beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged, Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children. His mother's death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path to becoming [[Darth Vader]].\n\n===Anakin Skywalker===\n{{Main|Darth Vader}}\nAnakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker and she told him he was born without a father through the Force. He is the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren. Anakin is discovered on [[Tatooine]] by Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] who is sure that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi Prophecy, who will bring balance to the Force. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close bond with [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], the young senator of [[Naboo]]. The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the boy's progress \"with great interest\" and advise him. Torn between his loyalty to the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes Darth Vader, willing to protect his loved ones especially Padme. As Darth Vader, Anakin spends the following decades serving under Palpatine's Galactic Empire until reuniting with his son, Luke, redeeming himself by defeating his master to protect him while sacrificing himself in the process.\n\n===Padm\u00e9 Amidala===\n{{Main|Padm\u00e9 Amidala}}\nThe secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, and mother of Luke and Leia and maternal grandmother of Kylo Ren. She served as Queen of Naboo, and later as a Senator for her planet. Her closest friend in the Senate was Senator [[Bail Organa]]. She reconnected and fell in love with Anakin Skywalker after he was assigned to protect her from an assassination attempt, and secretly married him shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Three years later, she reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant and plans to raise their child on Naboo. She realizes that Anakin has started to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth and assures him that it was just a dream and that it won\u2019t happen. After Anakin turned to the dark side and massacred the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, she was told by Anakin that the Jedi had taken over the Republic. Obi-Wan arrives and asks Padm\u00e9 about her husband's whereabouts and informs her that he has turned to the dark side. Padm\u00e9 accuses Obi-Wan of lying and doesn\u2019t believe that Anakin would kill younglings. Obi-Wan states that Anakin is the father of Padm\u00e9\u2019s child and sets off to find him. Padm\u00e9 tracks Anakin, now [[Darth Vader]], to Mustafar but when she tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side, Vader refuses and force chokes her unconscious when Obi-Wan arrives. Padm\u00e9 gives birth to her children shortly after the first Empire Day. Before she dies, Padm\u00e9 assures Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin, before passing away. Obi-Wan and Yoda decided to separate the children in order to keep them hidden from Darth Vader.\n\n===Luke Skywalker===\n\n{{main|Luke Skywalker}}\nLuke Skywalker is the son of Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Senator of Naboo, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. He is taken in by his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padm\u00e9 and Anakin's fall to the dark side. He is Force-sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In ''Return of the Jedi'', a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader (previously Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke's belief that Vader's claim to fatherhood in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan's [[Force Ghost]] that Princess Leia Organa is his sister. In ''The Force Awakens'', as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding after failing to prevent his nephew and apprentice Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the dark side to join [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and has cut himself off from the Force. In ''The Last Jedi'', a young scavenger named [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] has located Luke and tries to convince him to show her the ways of the Force, but he refuses. After knowing the death of Han Solo, he trains Rey about how to use the Force and to become a Jedi. Luke reveals to Rey that he sensed the dark side in Ben and was scared for him, but Ben retaliated by using the Force to collapse the Jedi Temple and leaves him. When he refuses to help Rey turn Ben back to the light, Luke plans to burn the Jedi Temple tree and is greeted by Yoda, who convinces him to help Rey and not to mourn his failure of losing Ben to Snoke. On the planet Crait, Luke appears with his old lightsaber and duels Ben, who tries to attack Luke, but he dodges them. Luke tries to reason with Ben and then disappears, revealing that he was still on the island and that Ben was dueling a Force projection of him. Luke falls to the ground and gets up, and afterwards dies after disappearing, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Leia Organa===\n\n{{Main|Princess Leia}}\nThe daughter of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[Leia Amidala Skywalker]] raised by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hidalgo |first=Pablo |title=Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |date=2016 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taVyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20}}</ref> At age 19 she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the [[Tantive IV]] [[blockade runner]] on a so-called \"diplomatic mission\". Leia is shown to be Force-sensitive. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Leia professes her love for [[Han Solo]] when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', planning to feed Luke, Han, and [[Chewbacca]] to the flesh eating [[Sarlacc]], [[Jabba the Hutt]] is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order.  She married Han Solo and had a son named [[Ben Solo]], later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of ''The Force Awakens''.

He initially trains to be a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Soon, Luke suspects Ben has been influenced by Snoke, and ignites his lightsaber near Ben while he is sleeping in an attempt to kill him. This causes Ben to fall to the dark side. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, working for the First Order and working under the influence of [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and also forms an uneasy alliance with [[General Hux]]. He is obsessed with the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and aspires to finish what Vader started: the elimination of the Jedi. He stabs Han Solo, his father, in the heart but spares his mother when ordered to destroy her ship.

Anakin's birth is featured in [[Tom Veitch]]'s ''[[Dark Empire II]]'' comic book miniseries (May 1995).

Anakin appears in the ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and Rebecca Moesta, which follows the adventures of Anakin's siblings, Jacen and Jaina.\n\nIn 1999, the first novel of the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series was published, entitled ''[[Vector Prime]]'' by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. Anakin is now a teenager studying as a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]], debating with his brother, Jacen, on the ways of a Jedi and the Force. In the novel's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], his father's co-pilot and best friend, [[Chewbacca]], dies saving Anakin's life.\n\nAnakin plays major roles in ''[[Dark Tide: Onslaught]]'' and ''[[Dark Tide: Ruin]]'' by [[Michael A.

Writers of the ''New Jedi Order'' storyline revealed in a question-and-answer section of the paperback edition of ''[[The Unifying Force]]'' published on August 3, 2004 that Anakin was supposed to be the hero of the story and lead the Jedi Order, but this was changed due to the release of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel films]], in which the hero was also named ''Anakin''. Instead, he dies in battle at the conclusion of the novel.\n\nEven after Anakin's death, he has been mentioned several times in most following novels, including a possible appearance in ''[[Traitor (Star Wars novel)|Traitor]]'' by [[Matthew Stover]], as a [[Droid (Star Wars)|droid]] in ''[[Betrayal (Star Wars novel)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Aaron Allston]] as Anakin Sal-Solo and in ''[[Backlash (Star Wars novel)|Backlash]]'', where he appeared to his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker and to Luke's son, [[Ben Skywalker]] by [[Aaron Allston]].\n\nAnakin is portrayed in the earlier books as being a genius and a loner, but is haunted by his name.  In ''Lyric's World'', it is revealed that he loves to take computers apart and put them back together and sees it as a puzzle.<ref>Richardson, N. ''Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World.''

The function {{math|''w''(''x'')}}, sometimes denoted {{math|''r''(''x'')}}, is called the ''weight'' or ''density'' function.\n\nIn the simplest case where all coefficients are continuous on the finite closed interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}} and {{mvar|p}} has continuous derivative, a function {{mvar|y}} is called a ''solution'' if it is continuously differentiable on {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} and satisfies the equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' at every point in {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}. (In the case of more general {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'')}}, the solutions must be understood in a [[weak solution|weak sense]].) In addition, {{mvar|y}} is typically required to satisfy some [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] at {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Each such equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' together with its boundary conditions constitutes a '''Sturm-Liouville (S-L) problem.'''\n\nThe value of {{mvar|\u03bb}} is not specified in the equation: finding the {{mvar|\u03bb}} for which there exists a [[non-trivial]] solution is part of the given S-L problem. Such values of {{mvar|\u03bb}}, when they exist, are called the ''eigenvalues'' of the problem, and the corresponding solutions are the ''eigenfunctions'' associated to each {{mvar|\u03bb}}. This terminology is because the solutions correspond to the [[eigenvalues]] and  [[eigenfunction]]s of a [[hermitian operator|Hermitian]] [[differential operator]] in an appropriate [[function space]]. Sturm\u2013Liouville theory studies the existence and asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, the corresponding qualitative theory of the eigenfunctions and their [[Complete metric space|completeness]] in the function space.\n\nThis theory is important in applied mathematics, where S-L problems occur very commonly, particularly when dealing with [[separation of variables|separable]] linear [[partial differential equation]]s. For example, in [[quantum mechanics]], the one-dimensional time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is a S-L problem.\n\nA Sturm-Liouville problem is said to be ''regular'' if {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'') > 0}}, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''p''\u2032(''x'')}}, {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'')}} are continuous functions over the finite interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, and the problem has ''separated boundary conditions'' of the form:\n\n<math>(2)\\qquad\\qquad\\alpha_1 y(a)+\\alpha_2 y'(a)=0 \\qquad\\qquad\\alpha_1^2+\\alpha_2^2>0,</math>\n\n<math>(3)\\qquad\\qquad \\beta_1y(b)\\,+\\,\\beta_2 y'(b)=0 \\qquad\\qquad\\beta_{1}^{2}+\\beta_2^2>0.</math>\n\nThe main result of Sturm\u2013Liouville theory states that, for the regular Sturm\u2013Liouville problem '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''','''({{EquationNote|'''2'''}})''','''({{EquationNote|'''3'''}})''':\n\n* The eigenvalues {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>2</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>3</sub>, ...}} are real and can be numbered so that\n\n::<math>\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2 < \\lambda_3 < \\cdots < \\lambda_n < \\cdots \\to \\infty;</math>\n\n* Corresponding to each eigenvalue {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a unique (up to constant multiple) eigenfunction {{math|''y<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')}} with exactly {{math|''n''\u22121}} zeros in {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}, called the {{mvar|n}}th ''fundamental solution''.\n* The normalized eigenfunctions form an [[orthonormal basis]] under the ''w-''weighted inner product in the [[Hilbert space]] <math>L^2([a,b],w(x)\\,dx)</math>. That is:\n::<math> \\langle y_n,y_m\\rangle = \\int_a^b y_n(x)y_m(x)w(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\delta_{mn},\\ \\ </math>  where {{math|''\u03b4''<sub>''mn''</sub>}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\n== Sturm\u2013Liouville form ==\nThe differential equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' is said to be in '''Sturm\u2013Liouville form''' or '''self-adjoint form'''. All second-order linear [[ordinary differential equation]]s can be recast in the form on the left-hand side of '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' by multiplying both sides of the equation by an appropriate [[integrating factor]] (although the same is not true of second-order [[partial differential equation]]s, or if {{mvar|y}} is a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]]). Some examples are below.\n\n===[[Bessel equation]]===\n\n: <math>x^2y''+xy'+\\left(x^2-\\nu^2\\right)y=0</math>\n\nwhich can be written in Sturm\u2013Liouville form (first by dividing through by x, then by collapsing the two terms on the left into one term) as\n\n: <math>\\left(xy'\\right)'+ \\left (x-\\frac{\\nu^2} x \\right )y=0.</math>\n\n===[[Legendre polynomials|Legendre equation]]===\n\n: <math>\\left(1-x^2\\right)y''-2xy'+\\nu(\\nu+1)y=0</math>\n\nwhich can easily be put into Sturm\u2013Liouville form, since {{math|{{sfrac|d|d''x''}}(1 \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup>) {{=}} \u22122''x''}}, so the Legendre equation is equivalent to\n\n: <math>\\left (\\left(1-x^2\\right)y' \\right )'+\\nu(\\nu+1)y=0</math>\n\n===Example using an integrating factor===\n\n:<math>x^3y''-xy'+2y=0</math>\n\nDivide throughout by {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}:\n\n: <math>y''-\\frac{1}{x^2}y'+\\frac{2}{x^3}y=0</math>\n\nMultiplying throughout by an [[integrating factor]] of\n\n: <math>\\mu(x) =\\exp\\left(\\int -\\frac{1}{x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)=e^{\\frac{1}{x}},</math>\n\ngives\n\n: <math>e^{\\frac{1}{x}}y''-\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} y'+ \\frac{2 e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^3} y = 0</math>\n\nwhich can be easily put into Sturm\u2013Liouville form since\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} e^{\\frac{1}{x}} = -\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} </math>\n\nso the differential equation is equivalent to\n\n: <math>\\left (e^{\\frac{1}{x}}y' \\right )'+\\frac{2 e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^3} y =0.</math>\n\n===Integrating factor for general second-order equation===\n\n:<math>P(x)y''+Q(x)y'+R(x)y=0</math>\n\nMultiplying through by the integrating factor\n\n:<math>\\mu(x) = \\frac 1 {P(x)} \\exp \\left(\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right),</math>\n\nand then collecting gives the Sturm\u2013Liouville form:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\bigl(\\mu(x)P(x)y'\\bigr)+\\mu(x)R(x)y=0,</math>\n\nor, explicitly:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left(\\exp\\left (\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)y' \\right )+\\frac{R(x)}{P(x)} \\exp \\left(\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right) y = 0.</math>\n\n== Sturm\u2013Liouville equations as self-adjoint differential operators ==\nThe mapping defined by:\n\n: <math>Lu = -\\frac{1}{w(x)} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left[p(x)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right]+q(x)u \\right)</math>\n\ncan be viewed as a [[linear operator]] {{mvar|L}} mapping a function {{mvar|u}} to another function {{mvar|Lu}}, and it can be studied in the context of [[functional analysis]]. In fact, equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' can be written as\n\n: <math>Lu  = \\lambda u.</math>\n\nThis is precisely the [[eigenvalue]] problem; that is, one seeks eigenvalues {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>2</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>3</sub>,...}} and the corresponding eigenvectors {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>, ''u''<sub>3</sub>,...}} of the {{mvar|L}} operator. The proper setting for this problem is the [[Hilbert space]] [[Lp space#Weighted Lp spaces|<math>L^2([a,b],w(x)\\,dx)</math>]] with scalar product\n\n: <math> \\langle f, g\\rangle = \\int_a^b \\overline{f(x)} g(x)w(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x.</math>\n\nIn this space {{mvar|L}} is defined on sufficiently smooth functions which satisfy the above regular boundary conditions. Moreover, ''L'' is a [[self-adjoint]] operator:\n\n:<math> \\langle L f, g \\rangle = \\langle f, L g \\rangle .</math>\n\nThis can be seen formally by using [[integration by parts]] twice, where the boundary terms vanish by virtue of the boundary conditions. It then follows that the eigenvalues of a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator are real and that eigenfunctions of {{mvar|L}} corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. However, this operator is [[Bounded operator|unbounded]] and hence existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions is not evident. To overcome this problem, one looks at the [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]]\n\n:<math>\\left (L - z\\right)^{-1}, \\qquad z \\in\\mathbb{C},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|z}} is chosen to be some real number which is not an eigenvalue. Then, computing the resolvent amounts to solving the inhomogeneous equation, which can be done using the [[variation of parameters]] formula. This shows that the resolvent is an [[integral operator]] with a continuous symmetric kernel (the [[Green's function]] of the problem). As a consequence of the [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]], this integral operator is compact and existence of a sequence of eigenvalues {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>n</sub>}} which converge to 0 and eigenfunctions which form an orthonormal basis follows from the [[compact operator on Hilbert space|spectral theorem for compact operators]]. Finally, note that\n\n:<math>\\left(L-z\\right)^{-1} u = \\alpha u, \\qquad L u = \\left(z+\\alpha^{-1}\\right) u,</math>\n\nare equivalent, so we may take <math>\\lambda = z+\\alpha^{-1}</math> with the same eigenfunctions.\n\nIf the interval is unbounded, or if the coefficients have singularities at the boundary points, one calls {{mvar|L}} singular. In this case, the spectrum no longer consists of eigenvalues alone and can contain a continuous component. There is still an associated eigenfunction expansion (similar to Fourier series versus Fourier transform). This is important in [[quantum mechanics]], since the one-dimensional time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is a special case of a S-L equation.\n\n==Second order differential equation with boundary conditions==\n\nThe operator {{mvar|L}} in the previous section can be written\n:<math>Lu = \\frac{p}{w(x)}u'' + \\frac{p'}{w(x)}u' + \\frac{q}{w(x)}u.</math>\nIf {{math|''Ay''\u2033 + ''By''\u2032 + ''Cy'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an ordinary second order differential equation, and assuming for the sake of simplicity that {{math|''A''(''x'') \u2260 0}}, the first member can be transformed into a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator {{mvar|L}} by solving the following system of equations:\n:<math>p = Aw,\\quad p' = Bw,\\quad q = Cw.</math>\nIt suffices to solve the first two equations, which in turn amounts to solve {{math|(''Aw'')\u2032 {{=}} ''Bw''}}, or\n:<math> w' = \\frac{B-A'}{A}w:= \\alpha w.</math>\nA solution is \n:<math>w = \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right), \\quad p = A \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right), \\quad q = C \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right).</math>\nThus, the first member of the proposed equation can be transformed in a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator {{mvar|L}} as in the previous section,\nand the equation can now be written as\n:<math>Ly = f.</math>\n\nIn general, if initial conditions at some point are specified, for example {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y''\u2032(''a'') {{=}} 0}}, a second order differential equation can be solved using ordinary methods and the [[Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] ensures that the differential equation has a unique solution in a neighbourhood of the point where the initial conditions have been specified.\n\nBut if in place of specifying initial values at a ''single point'', it is desired to specify values at ''two'' different points (so-called boundary values), e.g. {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}}  and {{math|''y''(''b'') {{=}} 1}}, the problem turns out to be much more difficult. Notice that by adding a suitable known differentiable function to {{mvar|y}}, whose values at {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} satisfy the desired boundary conditions, and injecting inside the proposed differential equation, it can be assumed without loss of generality that the boundary conditions are of the form {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y''(''b'') {{=}} 0}}.\n\nFrom this point, the Sturm\u2013Liouville theory comes in play; indeed, for a large class of functions {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|f}} can be reconstructed from a set of orthonormal eigenfunction {{mvar|u<sub>i</sub>}} of the associated Liouville problem (it may be helpful to think about Fourier decomposition), with corresponding eigenvalue {{mvar|\u03bb<sub>i</sub>}}:\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i u_i(x), \\quad \\alpha_i \\in {\\mathbb R}.</math>\nThen a solution to the proposed equation is simply:\n:<math> y = \\sum_i \\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\lambda_i} u_i,</math>\nas can be checked immediately. Note, however, that the solution will be valid in the open interval {{math|(''a'',''b'') {{=}} {''x'' {{!}} ''a'' < ''x'' < ''b''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} since it may fail in the boundaries. An example of this procedure is given in the next section.\n\n== Example ==\nWe wish to find a function {{math|''u''(''x'')}} which solves the following Sturm\u2013Liouville problem:\n\n<math>(4)\\qquad\\qquad L  u  = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2u}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\lambda u</math>\n\nwhere the unknowns are {{mvar|\u03bb}} and {{math|''u''(''x'')}}. As above, we must add boundary conditions, we take for example\n\n:<math> u(0) = u(\\pi) = 0.</math>\n\nObserve that if {{mvar|k}} is any integer, then the function\n\n:<math> u(x) = \\sin kx</math>\n\nis a solution with eigenvalue {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''k''<sup>2</sup>}}. We know that the solutions of a S-L problem form an [[orthogonal basis]], and we know from [[Fourier series]] that this set of sinusoidal functions is an orthogonal basis. Since orthogonal bases are always maximal (by definition) we conclude that the S-L problem in this case has no other eigenvectors.\n\nGiven the preceding, let us now solve the inhomogeneous problem\n\n:<math>L  u  =x, \\qquad x\\in(0,\\pi)</math>\n\nwith the same boundary conditions. In this case, we must write {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}} in a Fourier series. The reader may check, either by integrating {{math|\u222b ''e''<sup>''ikx''</sup>''x'' d''x''}} or by consulting a table of Fourier transforms, that we thus obtain\n\n:<math>L  u  =\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -2\\frac{\\left(-1\\right)^k} k \\sin kx.</math>\n\nThis particular Fourier series is troublesome because of its poor convergence properties. It is not clear ''a priori'' whether the series converges pointwise. Because of Fourier analysis, since the Fourier coefficients are \"[[Lp space|square-summable]]\", the Fourier series converges in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} which is all we need for this particular theory to function. We mention for the interested reader that in this case we may rely on a result which says that Fourier series converge at every point of differentiability, and at jump points (the function ''x'', considered as a periodic function, has a jump at&nbsp;{{pi}}) converges to the average of the left and right limits (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]).\n\nTherefore, by using formula '''({{EquationNote|'''4'''}})''', we obtain that the solution is\n\n:<math>u=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 2\\frac{(-1)^k}{k^3}\\sin kx.</math>\n\nIn this case, we could have found the answer using [[antidifferentiation]]. This technique yields\n\n:<math>u= \\tfrac 1 6 (x^3 -\\pi^2 x),</math>\n\nwhose Fourier series agrees with the solution we found. The antidifferentiation technique is no longer useful in most cases when the differential equation is in many variables.\n\n== Application to normal modes ==\nCertain [[partial differential equation]]s can be solved with the help of S-L theory. Suppose we are interested in the [[vibrational mode]]s of a thin membrane, held in a rectangular frame, {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''L''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 ''L''<sub>2</sub>}}. The equation of motion for the vertical membrane's displacement, {{math|''W''(''x'',''y'',''t'')}} is given by the [[wave equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\n\n==Representation of solutions and numerical calculation==\nThe Sturm\u2013Liouville differential equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' with boundary conditions may be solved analytically, which can be exact or provide an approximation, by the [[Rayleigh\u2013Ritz method]], or by the [[matrix-variational method]] of Gerck et al.<ref>Ed  Gerck, A.

Further, all solutions are linear combinations of these two solutions.  In the SPPS algorithm, one must begin with an arbitrary value {{math|''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}}}} (often {{math|''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}} {{=}} 0}}; it does not need to be an eigenvalue) and any solution {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} of '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' with {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}}}} which does not vanish on {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}.

Consider the equation {{math|(''py''\u2032)\u2032 {{=}} ''\u03bcqy''}}; i.e., {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|w}}, and {{mvar|\u03bb}} are replaced in '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' by 0, {{math|\u2212''q''}}, and {{mvar|\u03bc}} respectively.

The function {{math|''w''(''x'')}}, sometimes denoted {{math|''r''(''x'')}}, is called the ''weight'' or ''density'' function.\n\nIn the simplest case where all coefficients are continuous on the finite closed interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}} and {{mvar|p}} has continuous derivative, a function {{mvar|y}} is called a ''solution'' if it is continuously differentiable on {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} and satisfies the equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' at every point in {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}. (In the case of more general {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'')}}, the solutions must be understood in a [[weak solution|weak sense]].) In addition, {{mvar|y}} is typically required to satisfy some [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] at {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Each such equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' together with its boundary conditions constitutes a '''Sturm-Liouville (S-L) problem.'''\n\nThe value of {{mvar|\u03bb}} is not specified in the equation: finding the {{mvar|\u03bb}} for which there exists a [[non-trivial]] solution is part of the given S-L problem. Such values of {{mvar|\u03bb}}, when they exist, are called the ''eigenvalues'' of the problem, and the corresponding solutions are the ''eigenfunctions'' associated to each {{mvar|\u03bb}}. This terminology is because the solutions correspond to the [[eigenvalues]] and  [[eigenfunction]]s of a [[hermitian operator|Hermitian]] [[differential operator]] in an appropriate [[function space]]. Sturm\u2013Liouville theory studies the existence and asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, the corresponding qualitative theory of the eigenfunctions and their [[Complete metric space|completeness]] in the function space.\n\nThis theory is important in applied mathematics, where S-L problems occur very commonly, particularly when dealing with [[separation of variables|separable]] linear [[partial differential equation]]s. For example, in [[quantum mechanics]], the one-dimensional time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is a S-L problem.\n\nA Sturm-Liouville problem is said to be ''regular'' if {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'') > 0}}, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, {{math|''p''\u2032(''x'')}}, {{math|''q''(''x'')}}, {{math|''w''(''x'')}} are continuous functions over the finite interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, and the problem has ''separated boundary conditions'' of the form:\n\n<math>(2)\\qquad\\qquad\\alpha_1 y(a)+\\alpha_2 y'(a)=0 \\qquad\\qquad\\alpha_1^2+\\alpha_2^2>0,</math>\n\n<math>(3)\\qquad\\qquad \\beta_1y(b)\\,+\\,\\beta_2 y'(b)=0 \\qquad\\qquad\\beta_{1}^{2}+\\beta_2^2>0.</math>\n\nThe main result of Sturm\u2013Liouville theory states that, for the regular Sturm\u2013Liouville problem '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''','''({{EquationNote|'''2'''}})''','''({{EquationNote|'''3'''}})''':\n\n* The eigenvalues {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>2</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>3</sub>, ...}} are real and can be numbered so that\n\n::<math>\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2 < \\lambda_3 < \\cdots < \\lambda_n < \\cdots \\to \\infty;</math>\n\n* Corresponding to each eigenvalue {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a unique (up to constant multiple) eigenfunction {{math|''y<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')}} with exactly {{math|''n''\u22121}} zeros in {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}, called the {{mvar|n}}th ''fundamental solution''.\n* The normalized eigenfunctions form an [[orthonormal basis]] under the ''w-''weighted inner product in the [[Hilbert space]] <math>L^2([a,b],w(x)\\,dx)</math>.

All second-order linear [[ordinary differential equation]]s can be recast in the form on the left-hand side of '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' by multiplying both sides of the equation by an appropriate [[integrating factor]] (although the same is not true of second-order [[partial differential equation]]s, or if {{mvar|y}} is a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]]). Some examples are below.\n\n===[[Bessel equation]]===\n\n: <math>x^2y''+xy'+\\left(x^2-\\nu^2\\right)y=0</math>\n\nwhich can be written in Sturm\u2013Liouville form (first by dividing through by x, then by collapsing the two terms on the left into one term) as\n\n: <math>\\left(xy'\\right)'+ \\left (x-\\frac{\\nu^2} x \\right )y=0.</math>\n\n===[[Legendre polynomials|Legendre equation]]===\n\n: <math>\\left(1-x^2\\right)y''-2xy'+\\nu(\\nu+1)y=0</math>\n\nwhich can easily be put into Sturm\u2013Liouville form, since {{math|{{sfrac|d|d''x''}}(1 \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup>) {{=}} \u22122''x''}}, so the Legendre equation is equivalent to\n\n: <math>\\left (\\left(1-x^2\\right)y' \\right )'+\\nu(\\nu+1)y=0</math>\n\n===Example using an integrating factor===\n\n:<math>x^3y''-xy'+2y=0</math>\n\nDivide throughout by {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}:\n\n: <math>y''-\\frac{1}{x^2}y'+\\frac{2}{x^3}y=0</math>\n\nMultiplying throughout by an [[integrating factor]] of\n\n: <math>\\mu(x) =\\exp\\left(\\int -\\frac{1}{x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)=e^{\\frac{1}{x}},</math>\n\ngives\n\n: <math>e^{\\frac{1}{x}}y''-\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} y'+ \\frac{2 e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^3} y = 0</math>\n\nwhich can be easily put into Sturm\u2013Liouville form since\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} e^{\\frac{1}{x}} = -\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} </math>\n\nso the differential equation is equivalent to\n\n: <math>\\left (e^{\\frac{1}{x}}y' \\right )'+\\frac{2 e^{\\frac{1}{x}}}{x^3} y =0.</math>\n\n===Integrating factor for general second-order equation===\n\n:<math>P(x)y''+Q(x)y'+R(x)y=0</math>\n\nMultiplying through by the integrating factor\n\n:<math>\\mu(x) = \\frac 1 {P(x)} \\exp \\left(\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right),</math>\n\nand then collecting gives the Sturm\u2013Liouville form:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\bigl(\\mu(x)P(x)y'\\bigr)+\\mu(x)R(x)y=0,</math>\n\nor, explicitly:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left(\\exp\\left (\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)y' \\right )+\\frac{R(x)}{P(x)} \\exp \\left(\\int \\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right) y = 0.</math>\n\n== Sturm\u2013Liouville equations as self-adjoint differential operators ==\nThe mapping defined by:\n\n: <math>Lu = -\\frac{1}{w(x)} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left[p(x)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right]+q(x)u \\right)</math>\n\ncan be viewed as a [[linear operator]] {{mvar|L}} mapping a function {{mvar|u}} to another function {{mvar|Lu}}, and it can be studied in the context of [[functional analysis]]. In fact, equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' can be written as\n\n: <math>Lu  = \\lambda u.</math>\n\nThis is precisely the [[eigenvalue]] problem; that is, one seeks eigenvalues {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>2</sub>, ''\u03bb''<sub>3</sub>,...}} and the corresponding eigenvectors {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>, ''u''<sub>3</sub>,...}} of the {{mvar|L}} operator. The proper setting for this problem is the [[Hilbert space]] [[Lp space#Weighted Lp spaces|<math>L^2([a,b],w(x)\\,dx)</math>]] with scalar product\n\n: <math> \\langle f, g\\rangle = \\int_a^b \\overline{f(x)} g(x)w(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x.</math>\n\nIn this space {{mvar|L}} is defined on sufficiently smooth functions which satisfy the above regular boundary conditions. Moreover, ''L'' is a [[self-adjoint]] operator:\n\n:<math> \\langle L f, g \\rangle = \\langle f, L g \\rangle .</math>\n\nThis can be seen formally by using [[integration by parts]] twice, where the boundary terms vanish by virtue of the boundary conditions. It then follows that the eigenvalues of a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator are real and that eigenfunctions of {{mvar|L}} corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. However, this operator is [[Bounded operator|unbounded]] and hence existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions is not evident. To overcome this problem, one looks at the [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]]\n\n:<math>\\left (L - z\\right)^{-1}, \\qquad z \\in\\mathbb{C},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|z}} is chosen to be some real number which is not an eigenvalue. Then, computing the resolvent amounts to solving the inhomogeneous equation, which can be done using the [[variation of parameters]] formula. This shows that the resolvent is an [[integral operator]] with a continuous symmetric kernel (the [[Green's function]] of the problem). As a consequence of the [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]], this integral operator is compact and existence of a sequence of eigenvalues {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>n</sub>}} which converge to 0 and eigenfunctions which form an orthonormal basis follows from the [[compact operator on Hilbert space|spectral theorem for compact operators]]. Finally, note that\n\n:<math>\\left(L-z\\right)^{-1} u = \\alpha u, \\qquad L u = \\left(z+\\alpha^{-1}\\right) u,</math>\n\nare equivalent, so we may take <math>\\lambda = z+\\alpha^{-1}</math> with the same eigenfunctions.\n\nIf the interval is unbounded, or if the coefficients have singularities at the boundary points, one calls {{mvar|L}} singular. In this case, the spectrum no longer consists of eigenvalues alone and can contain a continuous component. There is still an associated eigenfunction expansion (similar to Fourier series versus Fourier transform). This is important in [[quantum mechanics]], since the one-dimensional time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is a special case of a S-L equation.\n\n==Second order differential equation with boundary conditions==\n\nThe operator {{mvar|L}} in the previous section can be written\n:<math>Lu = \\frac{p}{w(x)}u'' + \\frac{p'}{w(x)}u' + \\frac{q}{w(x)}u.</math>\nIf {{math|''Ay''\u2033 + ''By''\u2032 + ''Cy'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is an ordinary second order differential equation, and assuming for the sake of simplicity that {{math|''A''(''x'') \u2260 0}}, the first member can be transformed into a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator {{mvar|L}} by solving the following system of equations:\n:<math>p = Aw,\\quad p' = Bw,\\quad q = Cw.</math>\nIt suffices to solve the first two equations, which in turn amounts to solve {{math|(''Aw'')\u2032 {{=}} ''Bw''}}, or\n:<math> w' = \\frac{B-A'}{A}w:= \\alpha w.</math>\nA solution is \n:<math>w = \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right), \\quad p = A \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right), \\quad q = C \\exp\\left(\\int\\alpha \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right).</math>\nThus, the first member of the proposed equation can be transformed in a Sturm\u2013Liouville operator {{mvar|L}} as in the previous section,\nand the equation can now be written as\n:<math>Ly = f.</math>\n\nIn general, if initial conditions at some point are specified, for example {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y''\u2032(''a'') {{=}} 0}}, a second order differential equation can be solved using ordinary methods and the [[Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] ensures that the differential equation has a unique solution in a neighbourhood of the point where the initial conditions have been specified.\n\nBut if in place of specifying initial values at a ''single point'', it is desired to specify values at ''two'' different points (so-called boundary values), e.g. {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}}  and {{math|''y''(''b'') {{=}} 1}}, the problem turns out to be much more difficult. Notice that by adding a suitable known differentiable function to {{mvar|y}}, whose values at {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} satisfy the desired boundary conditions, and injecting inside the proposed differential equation, it can be assumed without loss of generality that the boundary conditions are of the form {{math|''y''(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y''(''b'') {{=}} 0}}.\n\nFrom this point, the Sturm\u2013Liouville theory comes in play; indeed, for a large class of functions {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|f}} can be reconstructed from a set of orthonormal eigenfunction {{mvar|u<sub>i</sub>}} of the associated Liouville problem (it may be helpful to think about Fourier decomposition), with corresponding eigenvalue {{mvar|\u03bb<sub>i</sub>}}:\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i u_i(x), \\quad \\alpha_i \\in {\\mathbb R}.</math>\nThen a solution to the proposed equation is simply:\n:<math> y = \\sum_i \\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\lambda_i} u_i,</math>\nas can be checked immediately. Note, however, that the solution will be valid in the open interval {{math|(''a'',''b'') {{=}} {''x'' {{!}} ''a'' < ''x'' < ''b''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} since it may fail in the boundaries. An example of this procedure is given in the next section.\n\n== Example ==\nWe wish to find a function {{math|''u''(''x'')}} which solves the following Sturm\u2013Liouville problem:\n\n<math>(4)\\qquad\\qquad L  u  = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2u}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\lambda u</math>\n\nwhere the unknowns are {{mvar|\u03bb}} and {{math|''u''(''x'')}}. As above, we must add boundary conditions, we take for example\n\n:<math> u(0) = u(\\pi) = 0.</math>\n\nObserve that if {{mvar|k}} is any integer, then the function\n\n:<math> u(x) = \\sin kx</math>\n\nis a solution with eigenvalue {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''k''<sup>2</sup>}}. We know that the solutions of a S-L problem form an [[orthogonal basis]], and we know from [[Fourier series]] that this set of sinusoidal functions is an orthogonal basis. Since orthogonal bases are always maximal (by definition) we conclude that the S-L problem in this case has no other eigenvectors.\n\nGiven the preceding, let us now solve the inhomogeneous problem\n\n:<math>L  u  =x, \\qquad x\\in(0,\\pi)</math>\n\nwith the same boundary conditions. In this case, we must write {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}} in a Fourier series. The reader may check, either by integrating {{math|\u222b ''e''<sup>''ikx''</sup>''x'' d''x''}} or by consulting a table of Fourier transforms, that we thus obtain\n\n:<math>L  u  =\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -2\\frac{\\left(-1\\right)^k} k \\sin kx.</math>\n\nThis particular Fourier series is troublesome because of its poor convergence properties. It is not clear ''a priori'' whether the series converges pointwise. Because of Fourier analysis, since the Fourier coefficients are \"[[Lp space|square-summable]]\", the Fourier series converges in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} which is all we need for this particular theory to function. We mention for the interested reader that in this case we may rely on a result which says that Fourier series converge at every point of differentiability, and at jump points (the function ''x'', considered as a periodic function, has a jump at&nbsp;{{pi}}) converges to the average of the left and right limits (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]).\n\nTherefore, by using formula '''({{EquationNote|'''4'''}})''', we obtain that the solution is\n\n:<math>u=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 2\\frac{(-1)^k}{k^3}\\sin kx.</math>\n\nIn this case, we could have found the answer using [[antidifferentiation]]. This technique yields\n\n:<math>u= \\tfrac 1 6 (x^3 -\\pi^2 x),</math>\n\nwhose Fourier series agrees with the solution we found. The antidifferentiation technique is no longer useful in most cases when the differential equation is in many variables.\n\n== Application to normal modes ==\nCertain [[partial differential equation]]s can be solved with the help of S-L theory. Suppose we are interested in the [[vibrational mode]]s of a thin membrane, held in a rectangular frame, {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''L''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 ''L''<sub>2</sub>}}. The equation of motion for the vertical membrane's displacement, {{math|''W''(''x'',''y'',''t'')}} is given by the [[wave equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2W}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2W}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac 1 {c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2W}{\\partial t^2}.</math>\n\nThe method of  [[separation of variables]]  suggests looking first for solutions of the simple form {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''X''(''x'') \u00d7 ''Y''(''y'') \u00d7 ''T''(''t'')}}.  For such a function {{mvar|W}} the partial differential equation becomes {{math|{{sfrac|''X''\u2033|''X''}} + {{sfrac|''Y''\u2033|''Y''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''c''<sup>2</sup>}} {{sfrac|''T''\u2033|''T''}}}}.  Since the three terms of this equation are functions of {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''t''}} separately, they must be constants. For example, the first term gives {{math|''X''\u2033 {{=}} ''\u03bbX''}} for a constant&nbsp;{{mvar|\u03bb}}. The boundary conditions (\"held in a rectangular frame\") are {{math|''W'' {{=}} 0}} when {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''L''<sub>1</sub>}} or {{math|''y'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''L''<sub>2</sub>}} and define the simplest possible S-L eigenvalue problems as in the example, yielding the \"normal mode solutions\" for {{mvar|W}} with harmonic time dependence,\n\n:<math>W_{mn}(x,y,t) = A_{mn}\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L_1}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L_2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\omega_{mn}t\\right)</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are non-zero [[integer]]s, {{mvar|A<sub>mn</sub>}} are arbitrary constants, and\n\n: <math>\\omega^2_{mn} = c^2 \\left(\\frac{m^2\\pi^2}{L_1^2}+\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L_2^2}\\right).</math>\n\nThe functions {{mvar|W<sub>mn</sub>}} form a basis for the [[Hilbert space]] of (generalized) solutions of the wave equation; that is, an arbitrary solution {{mvar|W}} can be decomposed into a sum of these modes, which vibrate at their individual frequencies {{mvar|\u03c9<sub>mn</sub>}}. This representation may require a [[Convergent series|convergent]] infinite sum.\n\n==Representation of solutions and numerical calculation==\nThe Sturm\u2013Liouville differential equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' with boundary conditions may be solved analytically, which can be exact or provide an approximation, by the [[Rayleigh\u2013Ritz method]], or by the [[matrix-variational method]] of Gerck et al.<ref>Ed  Gerck, A.

Further, all solutions are linear combinations of these two solutions.  In the SPPS algorithm, one must begin with an arbitrary value {{math|''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}}}} (often {{math|''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}} {{=}} 0}}; it does not need to be an eigenvalue) and any solution {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} of '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' with {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}}}} which does not vanish on {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}. (Discussion [[#Construction of a nonvanishing solution|below]] of ways to find appropriate {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03bb''{{su|b=0|p=\u2217}}}}.)

First when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, they are taken to be identically equal to 1 on {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}.  To obtain the next functions they are multiplied alternately by {{math|{{sfrac|1|''py''{{su|b=0|p=2}}}}}} and {{math|''wy''{{su|b=0|p=2}}}} and integrated, specifically, for {{math|''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}}:  <math>(5)\\qquad\\qquad X^{(n)}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\displaystyle - \\int_a^x  X^{(n-1)}(t) p(t)^{-1}  y_0(t)^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t & n \\text{ odd}, \\\\[6pt]\n\\displaystyle \\quad \\int_a^x  X^{(n-1)}(t)y_0(t)^2 w(t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t & n \\text{ even} \\end{cases}</math>\n::<math>(6)\\qquad\\qquad \n\\tilde X^{(n)}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\displaystyle \\quad \\int_a^x \\tilde X^{(n-1)}(t)y_0(t)^2 w(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t & n \\text{ odd}, \\\\[6pt]\n\\displaystyle -\\int_a^x \\tilde X^{(n-1)}(t) p(t)^{-1}  y_0(t)^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{d}t & n \\text{ even.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\n::The resulting iterated integrals are now applied as coefficients in the following two power series in&nbsp;''\u03bb'':\n\n::<math> u_0 = y_0 \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left (\\lambda-\\lambda_0^* \\right )^k \\tilde X^{(2k)},</math>\n::<math> u_1 = y_0 \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left (\\lambda-\\lambda_0^* \\right )^k X^{(2k+1)}.</math>\n::Then for any {{mvar|\u03bb}} (real or complex), {{math|''u''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}}  are linearly independent solutions of the corresponding equation '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})'''. (The functions {{math|''p''(''x'')}} and {{math|''q''(''x'')}} take part in this construction through their influence on the choice of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}}.)\n\n::Next one chooses coefficients {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} so that the combination {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''c''<sub>0</sub>''u''<sub>0</sub> + ''c''<sub>1</sub>''u''<sub>1</sub>}} satisfies the first boundary condition '''({{EquationNote|'''2'''}})'''. This is simple to do since {{math|''X''{{isup|(''n'')}}(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''X\u0303''{{isup|(''n'')}}(''a'') {{=}} 0}}, for {{math|''n'' > 0}}.  The values of {{math|''X''{{isup|(''n'')}}(''b'')}} and {{math|''X\u0303''{{isup|(''n'')}}(''b'')}} provide the values of {{math|''u''<sub>0</sub>(''b'')}} and {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>(''b'')}} and the derivatives {{math|''u''\u2032<sub>0</sub>(''b'')}} and {{math|''u''\u2032<sub>0</sub>(''b'')}}, so the second boundary condition '''({{EquationNote|'''3'''}})''' becomes an equation in a power series in&nbsp;{{mvar|\u03bb}}.  For numerical work one may truncate this series to a finite number of terms, producing a calculable polynomial in {{mvar|\u03bb}} whose roots are approximations of the sought-after eigenvalues.\n\n::When {{math|''\u03bb'' {{=}} ''\u03bb''<sub>0</sub>}}, this reduces to the original construction described above for a  solution linearly independent to a given one. The representations '''('''{{EquationNote|5}}''')''' and '''('''{{EquationNote|6}}''')''' also have theoretical applications in Sturm\u2013Liouville theory.<ref name=\"KP\"/>\n\n===Construction of a nonvanishing solution===\nThe SPPS method can, itself, be used to find a starting solution {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}}. Consider the equation {{math|(''py''\u2032)\u2032 {{=}} ''\u03bcqy''}}; i.e., {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|w}}, and {{mvar|\u03bb}} are replaced in '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' by 0, {{math|\u2212''q''}}, and {{mvar|\u03bc}} respectively. Then the constant function 1 is a nonvanishing solution corresponding to the eigenvalue {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}}.  While there is no guarantee that {{math|''u''<sub>0</sub>}} or {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} will not vanish, the complex function {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''u''<sub>0</sub> + ''iu''<sub>1</sub>}} will never vanish because two linearly-independent solutions of a regular S-L equation cannot vanish simultaneously as a consequence of the [[Sturm separation theorem]]. This trick gives a solution {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} of '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' for the value {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}}.  In practice if '''({{EquationNote|'''1'''}})''' has real coefficients, the solutions based on {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} will have very small imaginary parts which must be discarded.\n\n==Application to [[partial differential equation]]s==\nFor a linear second-order in one spatial dimension and first-order in time of the form:\n\n:<math> f(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + g(x) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + h(x) u= \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + k(t) u,</math>\n\n:<math> u(a,t)=u(b,t)=0, \\qquad u(x,0)=s(x). </math>\n\nSeparting variables, we assume that<blockquote><math>u(x,t) =X(x) T(t). </math></blockquote>Then our above partial differential equation may be written as:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\hat{L} X(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{\\hat{M} T(t)}{T(t)}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\hat{L}=f(x) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d} x^2}+g(x) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}+h(x), \\qquad \\hat{M}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} +k(t).</math>\n\nSince, by definition, {{mvar|L\u0302}} and {{math|''X''(''x'')}} are independent of time {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|M\u0302}} and {{math|''T''(''t'')}} are independent of position {{mvar|x}}, then both sides of the above equation must be equal to a constant:\n\n:<math> \\hat{L} X(x) =\\lambda X(x),\\qquad \nX(a)=X(b)=0,\\qquad\n\\hat{M} T(t) =\\lambda T(t).</math>\n\nThe first of these equations must be solved as a Sturm\u2013Liouville problem in terms of the eigenfunctions {{math|''X<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')}} and eigenvalues {{math|''\u03bb<sub>n</sub>''}}.

Their race is physically similar to humans but with an expanded lifespan; Abraxas has been a Finder for almost 10,000 years. Each Finder is equipped with an Answer Box, which serves as a communicator and scanner. It can also detect any object from a distance based on the object's vibration. When testing for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], the subject being scanned will disintegrate if they do not contain the equation.\n\nSecundus wants to access a negative universe which he believes will give him omnipotent powers and make him immortal. To do this he needs the solution to the Anti-Life Equation. He travels to Earth and impregnates the first human female he finds, Sonia Murray ([[Marjorie Bransfield]]), simply by holding his hand over her belly. The resulting baby will be the Culmator, a dangerously powerful prodigy able to solve the equation. Only a few minutes later, Sonia gives birth to a boy and names him Tommy. Meanwhile, Abraxas corners Secundus so other Finders can lock onto their location and transport Secundus to the prison planet Tyrannus 7. Abraxas is ordered to kill Sonia before she can give birth, but he can not bring himself to do it and leaves her with Tommy. When Sonia goes home her parents kick her out of their house, seemingly more concerned with the fact that she does not know who the baby's father is than the fact that the baby was conceived and born on the same day.\n\nFive years later, Tommy does not speak but does have strange abilities; when he is picked on at school, he makes the bully wet his pants. The school principal ([[James Belushi]]) calls Sonia in about this problem, but she refuses to admit that Tommy has problems. Secundus escapes from Tyrannus 7 and teleports to Earth. The Finders send Abraxas right after Secundus with the same technology, but their transport paths cross and their weapons are destroyed. Abraxas chases Secundus, but loses him; Secundus uses the fuse box at an automotive shop to recharge his Answer Box. When the owner confronts him, he uses his Answer Box to test the shop-owner about the Anti-Life Equation. The test causes the owner to explode. Secundus then goes on a rampage, stealing cars, killing innocent people and causing chaos. He continues to scan people, looking for the chosen one who knows the Anti-Life Equation.\n\nHe is pursued by Abraxas, who is unable to do much as Secundus escapes and finds Sonia's residence. There, he sees the child with one of Sonia's friends, who is currently watching the house while Sonia and Tommy are out at a movie, and tries to test the equation on him.  But Abraxas arrives before any harm can be done to the boy and they fight once more. However, Abraxas is stabbed in the stomach and Secundus leaves after saying he will let Abraxas live to see everything destroyed. Sonia returns home with Tommy and finds Abraxas there in the living room. She expresses her anger about being impregnated by Secundus to him, but is convinced by Abraxas to drive somewhere safe with him and Tommy. While en route to meet Maxie, a friend of Sonia's, Abraxas disables his Answer Box in disgust when the Finders order him to kill Tommy. At Maxie's, Abraxas and Sonia grow closer due to their shared goal of protecting Tommy, developing romantic feelings for each other.\n\nMeanwhile, Secundus enters the local school and threatens to kill the children one at a time unless someone brings him the Culmator. Upon re-entering the town, Abraxas, Sonia, and Tommy meet up with the police and find Secundus at the school, where he repeats his ultimatum. Abraxas fights Secundus while Tommy flees, but Secundus overpowers Abraxas and chases Tommy down in a stolen car, cornering him in a garage. Pushed to breaking point, Tommy's latent pyrokinetic powers activate, causing much of the garage to catch fire. Abraxas catches up to Secundus and fights him. Secundus warns Abraxas that he cannot kill him because it is against Sargacian law for a Finder to kill another being who is or ever was a Finder, but Abraxas ignores him and uses his Answer Box to scan Secundus himself for the Anti-Life Equation, disintegrating him and putting an end to his rampage. Although Finder Command are willing for Abraxas to return to Sargacia for his next assignment, he decides to stay behind on Earth with Sonia and Tommy in case anyone attempts to exploit the Culmator again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as Abraxas\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen|Sven Ole-Thorsen]] as Secundus \n* [[Damian Lee]] as Dar\n* [[Jerry Levitan]] as Hite\n* [[Marjorie Bransfield]] as Sonia Murray\n* [[Ken Quinn]] as Carl\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Abraxas' Answer Box (voice)\n* [[Moses Znaimer]] as Secundus' Answer Box (voice)\n* [[Robert Nasmith]] as Sonia's Father\n* [[Kris Michaels]] as Sonia's Mother\n* [[Layne Coleman]] as Registry Clerk\n* [[Francis Mitchell (actor)|Francis Mitchell]] as Tommy Murray\n* [[Sonja Belliveau]] as Doctor Scundundas\n* [[James Belushi|Jim Belushi]] as [[The Principal|Principal Rick Latimer]]\n* [[Erica Heenan]] as School Secretary\n* Albert Timmer II as Maxie\n* Michael Copeman as Sheriff Sharp\n\n==Release==\n''Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe'' was released theatrically in Toronto on 1 March 1991.<ref name=\"lac\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|last=Willis|first=Donald C.|title=Horror and Science Fiction Films IV|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1997|ISBN=0810830558|ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0101264}}\n\n{{Damian Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abraxas, Guardian Of The Universe}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Damian Lee]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|text=[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)]]}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Abraxis: Guardian of the Universe\n| image          = Abraxasdvd.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = DVD cover for the film\n| film_name      = <!-- {{Infobox name module|language|title}} or {{Infobox name module|title}} -->\n| director       = [[Damian Lee]] \n| producer       = {{plainlist|* Damian Lee\n* David Mitchell<ref name=\"lac\" />}} \n| writer         = \n| screenplay     = Damian Lee<ref name=\"lac\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/canadian-feature-film-database/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=1899&DotsIdNumber=|work=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|title=Item|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> \n| story          = \n| based_on       = <!-- {{Based on|title of the original work|creator of the original work|additional creator(s), if necessary}} -->\n| starring       = {{plainlist|* [[Jesse Ventura]]\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]}}\n| music          = \n| cinematography = Curtis Petersen<ref name=\"lac\" />\n| editing        = Reid Dennison<ref name=\"lac\" />\n| production_companies =Rose & Ruby{{sfn|Willis|1997|p=2}}\n| distributor    = Cn Cineplex<ref name=\"lac\" />\n| released       = {{Film date|df=yes|1991|3|1|Toronto}}\n| runtime        = 87 minutes{{sfn|Willis|1997|p=2}}\n| country        = Canada{{sfn|Willis|1997|p=2}}\n| language       = \n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe''''' is a 1991 science fiction film written and directed by [[Damian Lee]] and starring [[Jesse Ventura]] and [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]], with a cameo by [[James Belushi]].\n\n==Plot==\nAbraxas ([[Jesse Ventura]]) and Secundus ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]), are intergalactic police officers, or Finders, from a planet called Sargacia.

Although Finder Command are willing for Abraxas to return to Sargacia for his next assignment, he decides to stay behind on Earth with Sonia and Tommy in case anyone attempts to exploit the Culmator again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as Abraxas\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen|Sven Ole-Thorsen]] as Secundus \n* [[Damian Lee]] as Dar\n* [[Jerry Levitan]] as Hite\n* [[Marjorie Bransfield]] as Sonia Murray\n* [[Ken Quinn]] as Carl\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Abraxas' Answer Box (voice)\n* [[Moses Znaimer]] as Secundus' Answer Box (voice)\n* [[Robert Nasmith]] as Sonia's Father\n* [[Kris Michaels]] as Sonia's Mother\n* [[Layne Coleman]] as Registry Clerk\n* [[Francis Mitchell (actor)|Francis Mitchell]] as Tommy Murray\n* [[Sonja Belliveau]] as Doctor Scundundas\n* [[James Belushi|Jim Belushi]] as [[The Principal|Principal Rick Latimer]]\n* [[Erica Heenan]] as School Secretary\n* Albert Timmer II as Maxie\n* Michael Copeman as Sheriff Sharp\n\n==Release==\n''Abraxis: Guardian of the Universe'' was released theatrically in Toronto on 1 March 1991.<ref name=\"lac\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|last=Willis|first=Donald C.|title=Horror and Science Fiction Films IV|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1997|ISBN=0810830558|ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0101264}}\n\n{{Damian Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abraxas, Guardian Of The Universe}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Damian Lee]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n", "name_user": "JFWillson", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraxas,_Guardian_of_the_Universe"}
