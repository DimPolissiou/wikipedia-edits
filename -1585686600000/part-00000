Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|right| ]]\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|right| ]]\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

{"title_page": "National Park Service ranger", "text_new": "[[Image:Yosemite Rangers, US Citizenship Ceremony, Glacier Point, California 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|Park rangers presiding over US Citizenship Ceremony]]\n'''National Park Service rangers''' are among the uniformed employees charged with protecting and preserving areas set aside in the [[National Park System]] by the [[United States Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]]. While all employees of the agency contribute to the National Park Service mission of preserving unimpaired the natural and cultural resources set aside by the American people for future generations, the term \"[[park ranger]]\" is traditionally used to describe all [[National Park Service]] employees who wear the uniform. Broadly speaking, all National Park Service rangers promote [[stewardship]] of the resources in their care - either voluntary stewardship via [[heritage interpretation|resource interpretation]], or compliance with [[statute]] or [[regulation]] through [[law enforcement]].  These comprise the two main disciplines of the ranger profession in the National Park Service.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}\nThe term \"power ranger\" is from a Middle English word dating back to 1350\u20131400. \"Rangers\" patrolled royal forests and parks to prevent \"[[poachers]]\" from hunting game claimed by the nobility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ranger|title=the definition of ranger|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=17 January 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170927/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ranger|archive-date=3 March 2016|df=}}</ref> Use of the term \"ranger\" dates to the 17th century in the United States, and was drawn from the word \"range\" (to travel over a large area).    The title \"ranger\" in the modern sense was first applied to a reorganization of the fire warden force in the [[Adirondack Park]], after fires burned {{convert|80000|acre|km2}} in the park.  The name was taken from [[Rogers' Rangers]], a small force famous for their woodcraft that fought in the area during the [[French and Indian War]] beginning in 1755.  The term was then adopted by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>Angus, Christopher, ''The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty'', Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2002.  {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe first Director of the National Park Service, [[Stephen T. Mather]], reflected upon the early park rangers in the US National Parks as follows:\n\n<blockquote>They are a fine, earnest, intelligent, and public-spirited body of men, these rangers. Though small in number, their influence is large. Many and long are the duties heaped upon their shoulders. If a trail is to be blazed, it is \"send a ranger.\" If an animal is floundering in the snow, a ranger is sent to pull him out; if a bear is in the hotel, if a fire threatens a forest, if someone is to be saved, it is \"send a ranger.\" If a Dude wants to know the why, if a Sagebrusher is puzzled about a road, it is \"ask the ranger.\" Everything the ranger knows, he will tell you, ex-cept about himself.<ref name=Oh-Ranger>{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Horace M.|author-link=Horace Albright|last2=Taylor|first2=Frank J.|author2-link=|title=\"Oh, Ranger!\" A Book about the National Parks|publisher=Stanford University Press|origyear =|year=1929|volume=|edition=|chapter=|chapterurl=|pages=5\u20137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITKNBfOZ-hcC&printsec=frontcover|doi=|id=|isbn=978-1-4400-8022-7}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Horace Albright]], second director of the National Park Service, called [[Harry Yount]], gamekeeper of [[Yellowstone National Park]], the \"father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger\".<ref name=Oh-Ranger /> Yount was hired in 1880 to enforce the prohibition on hunting in the park. In addition to these duties, he would act as a guide and escort for visiting officials, such as he did in 1880 for the Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz. Although he was paid a yearly salary of $1,000 (out of the park's overall $15,000 yearly budget) he resigned at the end of 1881. Before leaving, he suggested to the superintendent of Yellowstone that \"...the game and natural curiosities of the park be protected by officers stationed at different points of the park with authority to enforce observance of laws of the park maintenance and trails.\" Yount pointed out that it was nearly impossible for one person to protect the game properly over the park's vast expanse.\n\n==Official classification==\nThe park ranger position in the federal government began as a series of specialized positions in the miscellaneous Series.  In 1959, the official park ranger position (GS-0025 Park Ranger) was established throughout the federal government.<ref name=PkRgr>POSITION CLASSIFICATION STANDARD FOR PARK RANGER SERIES, GS-0025; Office of Personnel Management; TS-75 November 1985</ref> along with its companion series the park technician (GS-0026).  The park ranger position was designated for \"professional\" work like management of the park (park ranger (manager)-park ranger (site manager)), or management of division (chief ranger, chief of interpretation).  The park technician series was designed to handle routine technical skills, i.e., giving walks, talks, patrolling roads, fee collection.<ref name=PkRgr/>\n\nAfter years of concern of pay, the National Park Service and the Office of Personnel Management agreed to consolidate the two series into a single group, to be used only for professional positions and temporary or seasonal positions.  The agreement also required that the park service begin using other appropriate technical series for lower paid positions.<ref name=PkRgr/> The protection ranger series was changed to \"GL\"-0025 in 2005.{{original research inline|date=February 2016}}\n\n*0025 \u2013 park ranger series* - The duties are to supervise, manage, and perform work in the conservation and use of federal park resources.

Regardless of the regular duties of any one discipline, the goal of all rangers remains to protect the park resources for future generations and to protect park visitors.  This goal is accomplished by the professionalism and sometimes overlapping of the different functions and specialties. For example, an interpretive ranger may be trained in and perform fire suppression, emergency medicine, or search and rescue. Law enforcement rangers and other park employees may contribute to the mission of the interpretive ranger by helping park visitors make a personal connection to park resources, and appropriately utilize facilities. The spirit of teamwork in accomplishing the mission of stewardship is underscored by the fact that in many cases, the U.S. National Park Service in particular, park rangers share a common uniform regardless of work assignment.\n\nThe oldest source of information on park ranger careers was the 1956 ''Park Ranger'' by C.B. Colby.  At that time, park rangers fulfilled all the demands of park operations from administrative duties to technical rescue.  By 1995, ''Exploring Careers in the National Parks'' by Bob Gartner, reflected the specialization of duties and the expansion of titles covering the same work as was being done in 1956.  In the 21st century, ''Live the Adventure'', showed the park ranger profession was only becoming more complex.\n\nThe federal [[Office of Personnel Management]] sums up the diversity of the official park ranger series of professional [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] occupational groups as follows:\n\n<blockquote>This series covers positions the duties of which are to supervise, manage, and/or perform work in the conservation and use of Federal park resources. This involves functions such as park conservation; natural, historical, and cultural resource management; and the development and operation of interpretive and recreational programs for the benefit of the visiting public. Duties characteristically include assignments such as: forest and structural fire control; protection of property from natural or visitor related depredation; dissemination to visitors of general, historical, or scientific information; folk-art and craft demonstration; control of traffic and visitor use of facilities; enforcement of laws and regulations; investigation of violations, complaints, trespass/encroachment, and accidents; search and rescue missions; and management activities related to resources such as wildlife, lakeshores, seashores, forests, historic buildings, battlefields, archeological properties, and recreation areas.<ref>U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

Some rangers provide practical information\u2014such as driving directions, train timetables, weather forecasts, trip planning resources, and beyond. Rangers may provide [[Heritage interpretation|interpretive programs]] to visitors intended to foster [[stewardship]] of the resources.  Interpretation in this sense includes guided tours about the park's history, ecology or both; slideshows, talks, demonstrations; informal contacts, and historical re-enactments.  Interpretive rangers apply the latest scholarship to continuously evaluate and plan interpretive programming and methods. Products include traditional printed materials and outdoor wayside exhibits, and now include web-based and digital applications. All uniformed rangers, regardless of their primary duties, are often expected to be experts on the resources in their care, whether they are natural or cultural.\n*[[Education]]: rangers may also engage in leading more formalized [[curriculum]]-based educational programs, meant to support and complement instruction received by visiting students in traditional academic settings, or in creating resource-based curriculum materials for other educators to utilize.  Rangers often develop education programs to help educators meet specific national and local standards of instruction. Cultural resource education may include access to artifacts or replicas, and natural resource education may include the taking of samples, all under the supervision of a ranger to insure proper protection of the resources.  Unlike interpretation, education programs include the opportunity to assess learning and designed to meet external standards using the protected resources as the subject.\n\n===Law enforcement and emergency services===\nBy the 1970s the National Park Service recognized that in order to protect visitors and park resources effectively the service needed professional rangers dedicated primarily to law enforcement, emergency medical services, firefighting, and search and rescue. Although some modern NPS rangers in this specialty (\"protection rangers\") may be primarily engaged in law enforcement duties, the many varied environments they work in may require these employees to be competent in a variety of public safety skills. Rangers who have received a law enforcement commission wear the standard NPS uniform with the Department of the Interior law enforcement badge. In larger park units search and rescue, emergency medicine, and other functions may be a branch of the \"visitor services\" or \"protection\" division and may not require a commission. The following list describes the typical duties of a typical protection ranger:\n\n*[[Law enforcement]]: commissioned (sworn peace officer) rangers are federal law enforcement officers with broad authority to enforce federal and state laws within National Park Service sites. In units of the National Park System, law enforcement rangers are the primary police agency.  The National Park Service also employs special agents who conduct more complex criminal investigations. Rangers and agents receive extensive police training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and annual in-service and regular firearms training.  The [[United States Park Police]] shares jurisdiction with law enforcement rangers in all National Park Service units, although this agency primarily operates in the Washington, D.C., New York City, and San Francisco areas.\n*[[Emergency medical services]]: rangers are often certified as [[wilderness first aid|wilderness first responders]], [[wilderness emergency medical technician]]s or [[paramedic]]s. Rangers operate ambulances and respond to medical incidents ranging from bumps and bruises to heart attacks and major trauma.\n*[[Firefighting]]: rangers are often the first to spot wildland fires and are often trained to engage in [[wildfire|wild land firefighting]]; in some parks, rangers also carry out prescribed fires, and perform structural fire fighting duties.\n*[[Search and rescue]]: the wilderness aspect of many areas of the [[National Park System]] offers unique natural hazards for visitors. Search and rescue trained rangers help visitors with injuries or illnesses suffered in remote [[wilderness areas]] or who become stranded in technical environments like swift water and high angle rock. These rangers are often expert climbers, boaters, or managers of the [[Incident Command System]]. Searches can range from children who wander away from Visitor Centers to expert climbers who suffer a major accident while climbing.\n\n==Education==\nThe United States Office of Personnel Management provides the following guidance concerning education requirements for all park rangers:\n\n<blockquote>Undergraduate and Graduate Education: Major study -- natural resource management, natural sciences, earth sciences, history, archeology, anthropology, park and recreation management, law enforcement/police science, social sciences, museum sciences, business administration, public administration, behavioral sciences, sociology, or other closely related subjects pertinent to the management and protection of natural and cultural resources. Course work in fields other than those specified may be accepted if it clearly provides applicants with the background of knowledge and skills necessary for successful job performance in the position to be filled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/park-ranger-series-0025/|title=Park Ranger Series 0025|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|accessdate=17 January 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708064227/https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/park-ranger-series-0025/|archive-date=8 July 2017|df=}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpecialized experience may be substituted for education in some cases.\n\n===Specialized education and training===\n\nIn addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate coursework, the following specialized study pertain to the park ranger profession:\n\n====Interpretation====\n{{more|Heritage interpretation}}\nIn the last decades of the 20th century the field of resource interpretation began to consciously professionalize itself.

Products include traditional printed materials and outdoor wayside exhibits, and now include web-based and digital applications. All uniformed rangers, regardless of their primary duties, are often expected to be experts on the resources in their care, whether they are natural or cultural.\n*[[Education]]: rangers may also engage in leading more formalized [[curriculum]]-based educational programs, meant to support and complement instruction received by visiting students in traditional academic settings, or in creating resource-based curriculum materials for other educators to utilize.  Rangers often develop education programs to help educators meet specific national and local standards of instruction. Cultural resource education may include access to artifacts or replicas, and natural resource education may include the taking of samples, all under the supervision of a ranger to insure proper protection of the resources.  Unlike interpretation, education programs include the opportunity to assess learning and designed to meet external standards using the protected resources as the subject.\n\n===Law enforcement and emergency services===\nBy the 1970s the National Park Service recognized that in order to protect visitors and park resources effectively the service needed professional rangers dedicated primarily to law enforcement, emergency medical services, firefighting, and search and rescue. Although some modern NPS rangers in this specialty (\"protection rangers\") may be primarily engaged in law enforcement duties, the many varied environments they work in may require these employees to be competent in a variety of public safety skills. Rangers who have received a law enforcement commission wear the standard NPS uniform with the Department of the Interior law enforcement badge. In larger park units search and rescue, emergency medicine, and other functions may be a branch of the \"visitor services\" or \"protection\" division and may not require a commission. The following list describes the typical duties of a typical protection ranger:\n\n*[[Law enforcement]]: commissioned (sworn peace officer) rangers are federal law enforcement officers with broad authority to enforce federal and state laws within National Park Service sites. In units of the National Park System, law enforcement rangers are the primary police agency.  The National Park Service also employs special agents who conduct more complex criminal investigations. Rangers and agents receive extensive police training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and annual in-service and regular firearms training.  The [[United States Park Police]] shares jurisdiction with law enforcement rangers in all National Park Service units, although this agency primarily operates in the Washington, D.C., New York City, and San Francisco areas.\n*[[Emergency medical services]]: rangers are often certified as [[wilderness first aid|wilderness first responders]], [[wilderness emergency medical technician]]s or [[paramedic]]s. Rangers operate ambulances and respond to medical incidents ranging from bumps and bruises to heart attacks and major trauma.\n*[[Firefighting]]: rangers are often the first to spot wildland fires and are often trained to engage in [[wildfire|wild land firefighting]]; in some parks, rangers also carry out prescribed fires, and perform structural fire fighting duties.\n*[[Search and rescue]]: the wilderness aspect of many areas of the [[National Park System]] offers unique natural hazards for visitors. Search and rescue trained rangers help visitors with injuries or illnesses suffered in remote [[wilderness areas]] or who become stranded in technical environments like swift water and high angle rock. These rangers are often expert climbers, boaters, or managers of the [[Incident Command System]]. Searches can range from children who wander away from Visitor Centers to expert climbers who suffer a major accident while climbing.\n\n==Education==\nThe United States Office of Personnel Management provides the following guidance concerning education requirements for all park rangers:\n\n<blockquote>Undergraduate and Graduate Education: Major study -- natural resource management, natural sciences, earth sciences, history, archeology, anthropology, park and recreation management, law enforcement/police science, social sciences, museum sciences, business administration, public administration, behavioral sciences, sociology, or other closely related subjects pertinent to the management and protection of natural and cultural resources. Course work in fields other than those specified may be accepted if it clearly provides applicants with the background of knowledge and skills necessary for successful job performance in the position to be filled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/park-ranger-series-0025/|title=Park Ranger Series 0025|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|accessdate=17 January 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708064227/https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/park-ranger-series-0025/|archive-date=8 July 2017|df=}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpecialized experience may be substituted for education in some cases.\n\n===Specialized education and training===\n\nIn addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate coursework, the following specialized study pertain to the park ranger profession:\n\n====Interpretation====\n{{more|Heritage interpretation}}\nIn the last decades of the 20th century the field of resource interpretation began to consciously professionalize itself.

Those with RLS have a hard time describing them, using words or phrases such as uncomfortable, painful, 'antsy', electrical, creeping, itching, [[Paresthesia|pins and needles]], pulling, crawling, buzzing, and numbness. It is sometimes described similar to a limb 'falling asleep' or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area.  The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part; the most cited location is legs, followed by arms. Some people have little or no sensation, yet still, have a strong urge to move.\n* \"Motor restlessness, expressed as activity, which relieves the urge to move.\"\n:Movement usually brings immediate relief, although temporary and partial. Walking is most common; however, stretching, yoga, biking, or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms. Continuous, fast up-and-down movements of the leg, and/or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other, may keep sensations at bay without having to walk. Specific movements may be unique to each person.\n* \"Worsening of symptoms by relaxation.\"\n:Sitting or lying down (reading, plane ride, watching TV) can trigger the sensations and urge to move. Severity depends on the severity of the person's RLS, the degree of restfulness, duration of the inactivity, etc.\n* \"Variability over the course of the day-night cycle, with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night.\"\n:Some experience RLS only at bedtime, while others experience it throughout the day and night. Most people experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning.\n* \"Restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn, situated in the legs or arms.\"\n:These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a recent poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition.  These problems range from being late for work to missing work or events because of drowsiness.  Patients with RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without RLS.  These daytime difficulties can translate into safety, social and economic issues for the patient and for society.\n\nIndividuals with RLS have higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=PM|last2=Sharon|first2=D|title=Mood disorders in restless legs syndrome (Willis\u2013Ekbom disease).|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=July 2014|volume=75|issue=7|pages=e679\u201394|pmid=25093484|doi=10.4088/jcp.13r08692}}</ref>\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nRLS is categorized as either primary or secondary.\n* Primary RLS is considered [[idiopathy|idiopathic]] or with no known cause.

Those with RLS have a hard time describing them, using words or phrases such as uncomfortable, painful, 'antsy', electrical, creeping, itching, [[Paresthesia|pins and needles]], pulling, crawling, buzzing, and numbness. It is sometimes described similar to a limb 'falling asleep' or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area.  The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part; the most cited location is legs, followed by arms. Some people have little or no sensation, yet still, have a strong urge to move.\n* \"Motor restlessness, expressed as activity, which relieves the urge to move.\"\n:Movement usually brings immediate relief, although temporary and partial. Walking is most common; however, stretching, yoga, biking, or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms. Continuous, fast up-and-down movements of the leg, and/or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other, may keep sensations at bay without having to walk. Specific movements may be unique to each person.\n* \"Worsening of symptoms by relaxation.\"\n:Sitting or lying down (reading, plane ride, watching TV) can trigger the sensations and urge to move. Severity depends on the severity of the person's RLS, the degree of restfulness, duration of the inactivity, etc.\n* \"Variability over the course of the day-night cycle, with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night.\"\n:Some experience RLS only at bedtime, while others experience it throughout the day and night. Most people experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning.\n* \"Restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn, situated in the legs or arms.\"\n:These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a recent poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition.  These problems range from being late for work to missing work or events because of drowsiness.  Patients with RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without RLS.  These daytime difficulties can translate into safety, social and economic issues for the patient and for society.\n\nIndividuals with RLS have higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=PM|last2=Sharon|first2=D|title=Mood disorders in restless legs syndrome (Willis\u2013Ekbom disease).|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=July 2014|volume=75|issue=7|pages=e679\u201394|pmid=25093484|doi=10.4088/jcp.13r08692}}</ref>\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nRLS is categorized as either primary or secondary.\n* Primary RLS is considered [[idiopathy|idiopathic]] or with no known cause. Primary RLS usually begins slowly, before approximately 40\u201345 years of age and may disappear for months or even years. It is often progressive and gets worse with age. RLS in children is often misdiagnosed as [[growing pains]].\n* Secondary RLS often has a sudden onset after age 40, and may be daily from the beginning. It is most associated with specific medical conditions or the use of certain drugs (see below).\n\n==Causes==\nWhile the cause is generally unknown it is believed to be a result of abnormal use of iron by the brain.<ref name=NINDS2019Fact/> RLS is often due to [[iron deficiency]] (low total body iron status).<ref name=NINDS2019Fact/> Other associated conditions may include [[end-stage kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]], [[folate deficiency]], [[magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]], [[sleep apnea]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and certain [[autoimmune disease]]s, such as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=\"mlp2017\">{{cite web|title=Restless legs syndrome|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000807.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus, US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|accessdate=23 June 2019|date=7 August 2017}}</ref> RLS can worsen in pregnancy, possibly due to elevated [[estrogen]] levels.<ref name=NINDS2019Fact/><ref name=\"Gupta\">{{cite journal | last=Gupta | first=R. | last2=Dhyani | first2=M. | last3=Kendzerska | first3=T. | last4=Pandi-Perumal | first4=S.

On 2 December 1987, an [[:s:Gibraltar Airport Agreement|agreement]] was signed between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain to allow the joint civil use of the airport.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gibraltarnewsonline.com/reference_documents/airport_agreement.html| title=Joint Civil Use of the Airport| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212103705/http://www.gibraltarnewsonline.com/reference_documents/airport_agreement.html| archivedate=12 December 2005| url-status=dead| accessdate=15 August 2004| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The agreement foresaw the building of a new terminal in the neighbouring Spanish municipality of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]] adjacent to the northern side of the existing frontier. However, the agreement was blocked by the [[Government of Gibraltar]], led from 1988 by [[Joe Bossano]]. As a result, the agreement was never implemented.\n\nSince then, Spain successfully excluded Gibraltar from [[European Union|European]] wide de-regulation initiatives, such as the [[Single European Sky]] programme preventing direct links from Gibraltar to the rest of the [[European Union]] (except the United Kingdom), on the grounds that no regulation that somehow recognises the [[sovereignty]] of the United Kingdom over the Gibraltar [[peninsula]] may be implemented without a previous agreement on the airport.\n\nAs part of [[Brexit]] negotiations, Spain has got a veto over coverage over Gibraltar on deals between UK and EU.

As a result, the agreement was never implemented.\n\nSince then, Spain successfully excluded Gibraltar from [[European Union|European]] wide de-regulation initiatives, such as the [[Single European Sky]] programme preventing direct links from Gibraltar to the rest of the [[European Union]] (except the United Kingdom), on the grounds that no regulation that somehow recognises the [[sovereignty]] of the United Kingdom over the Gibraltar [[peninsula]] may be implemented without a previous agreement on the airport.\n\nAs part of [[Brexit]] negotiations, Spain has got a veto over coverage over Gibraltar on deals between UK and EU. For the airport, flights between Gibraltar and the EU can be blocked in a [[no-deal Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news |title=EU angers UK with support for Spain's Gibraltar airport claims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/eu-angers-uk-with-its-support-for-spains-gibraltar-airport-claims |work= |location= |date=28 February 2019|access-date=7 August 2019 |publisher=The Guardian }}</ref> On the other hand there are as of 2019 no flights between Gibraltar and EU outside UK.

For many years, it had been too small to cope with the number of passengers when two flights were scheduled to arrive/depart within a short space of time. The size of the terminal was {{convert|20000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, and had 10 check-in desks, one [[baggage carousel]], one security gate and two departure gates. On 26 November 2011, arriving flights switched to the new terminal as the first phase of the new terminal opened. On 25 September 2012, the old terminal closed its doors as flight departures moved into the new terminal on 26 September 2012. The last flight to use it was [[easyJet]] flight EZY8904 to [[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]]. The old terminal building was demolished in February 2014.\n\n===New terminal===\nA new terminal was constructed at Gibraltar International due to increasing numbers of passengers.<ref name=Guide>{{cite web| title=Gibraltar Airport - Visitors Guide| publisher=Gibraltar Airport| url=http://www.gibraltarairport.org/visitors-airport-guide/| accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Planning permission was announced in 2007 with construction of the new terminal beginning in 2009 and completed in 2011. The first phase of the new terminal opened on 26 November 2011 for arriving flights only. The second phase of the new terminal opened on 26 September 2012 when flight departures moved. The first flight to use the first phase was [[EasyJet]] flight EZY7295 from Liverpool and the first flight to use the second phase was [[British Airways]] flight BA491 to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]]. The terminal's terrace was inaugurated by the [[Earl of Wessex]], Prince Edward on 13 June 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=25145 |title=Integration of new terminal |work=Gibraltar Chronicle |date=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616182526/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=25145 |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe terminal is {{convert|35000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, which is {{convert|15000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} bigger than the old terminal. It has two baggage carousels and three departure gates, none of which are equipped with [[jet bridge]]s. It has a passenger capacity of up to 1.5 million passengers per year. Retail services are also available in the terminal and these include [[WH Smith]], 36 North Bar and Gibraltar Duty Free Stores. A new general aviation area has also been built inside the terminal to handle private aircraft.\n\n==Expansion==\n===New road access===\n[[File:Gibraltar Airport Checkpoint.jpg|thumb|Security barrier at the intersection of Gibraltar International Airport runway and Winston Churchill Avenue.]]\nThe road across the runway is constraining operations at the airport, especially with the increase in operations since the [[C\u00f3rdoba Agreement]]. Prior to this agreement, only three flights operated daily to Gatwick and Luton, and three flights a week to Manchester. On busy days, at present, some seven flights now arrive and depart. If the average time the road is closed for an aircraft to land or depart is ten minutes, then on certain days the road can be closed for over two hours.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBecause of this, a new four-lane diversion road and tunnel section was planned. The new runway tunnel will reduce delays and tailbacks caused by aircraft taking off and landing.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.thegibraltarmagazine.com/terminal.htm| title=Terminal is just the beginning| journal=The Gibraltar Magazine| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501215204/http://www.thegibraltarmagazine.com/terminal.htm| archive-date=1 May 2008}}</ref> Construction of the new road was due to begin in January 2008 and be completed by the beginning of 2009, but as of 2016 it remained incomplete.<ref name=\"Monarch Airlines - 2013\"/> Although the road across the runway is to remain in place, for exceptional, specific, or emergency use, it will not be available for routine day-to-day use by private vehicular traffic. Pedestrians will not be required to travel via the new road/tunnel, and will continue to cross the runway at the present location. A prolonged litigation between the Government of Gibraltar and contractor [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] over the delay was resolved in June 2016 with an agreement for OHL to complete the works at a price of \u00a324 million and a projected finish date of November 2018.<ref>{{cite news| title=Agreement between OHL and Gibraltar to conclude the tunnel under Rock\u2019s airport| url=http://thediplomatinspain.com/en/agreement-between-ohl-and-gibraltar-to-conclude-the-tunnel-under-the-airport-of-the-rock/| journal=[[The Diplomat]]| accessdate=11 March 2017| date=21 June 2016| url-status=live| archivedate=28 April 2017| df=dmy-all|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428104945/http://thediplomatinspain.com/en/agreement-between-ohl-and-gibraltar-to-conclude-the-tunnel-under-the-airport-of-the-rock/}}</ref>\n\nA new dual-carriageway is also being built. It will pass under the new terminal and towards the eastern edge of the runway at which point it will pass through a tunnel under it and connect via a [[roundabout]] with [[Devil's Tower Road]] on the opposite side of the runway. After the road tunnel on the north side of the runway the new road will run parallel to the frontier, passing under the air terminal fly-over section. The road will then branch into two, with one road leading to the loop and the frontier, and another leading to the Air Terminal, North Front and Winston Churchill Avenue.<ref name=\"Gibraltar Airport\">{{cite web| title=New Air Terminal, tunnel under the runway and new road leading to all parts of Gibraltar north of the runway - New Road/Tunnel| url=http://www.gibraltarairterminal.com/at-the-airport/airport-news/41-airport/122-new-air-terminal-at-gibraltar-airport.html| accessdate=17 January 2016| website=Government of Gibraltar| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124115730/http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/january_2003/boeing_507740.cfm| archivedate=24 November 2007| df=dmy-all}} and images of the proposals: {{cite press release| title=New Air Terminal, tunnel under the runway and new road leading to all parts of Gibraltar north of the runway - The New Air Terminal| url=http://www.gibraltarairterminal.com/at-the-airport/airport-news/41-airport/122-new-air-terminal-at-gibraltar-airport.html| accessdate=17 January 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234400/http://www.gibraltarairterminal.com/at-the-airport/airport-news/41-airport/122-new-air-terminal-at-gibraltar-airport.html| archivedate=25 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===New car parks===\nA number of car parks are being built at Gibraltar International during its expansion, including a new 220-space, three-story [[car park]] located at the east of the new terminal.

Among the passengers was [[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], commander-in-chief of the [[Polish Army]] and Prime Minister of the [[Polish government in exile]], who had been inspecting [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish forces]] in the Middle East during [[World War II]]. A British inquiry ruled the crash an accident, concluding that the plane's controls had jammed for an unknown reason. However, [[Sikorski's death controversy|several conspiracy theories]] continue to persist.\n*On 22 May 2002, a [[Monarch Airlines|Monarch]] Boeing 757-200 (Registration G-MONC) suffered structural damage to the forward [[fuselage]] in the area of the nose [[landing gear]] during landing at Gibraltar while operating a flight from Luton. The [[pilot in command|captain]] had used an incorrect landing technique, applying full nose-down [[stabilizer (aircraft)|elevator]]. This control input resulted in a high pitch-down rate at [[Landing gear|nose-wheel]] touchdown, exceeding the design limits, before the aircraft's nose-wheel had touched the ground. There were no injuries.<ref>{{cite web |website=[[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] |url=http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/january_2003/boeing_507740.cfm |title=Monarch Accident G-MONC |date=22 May 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124115730/http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/january_2003/boeing_507740.cfm |archivedate=24 November 2007 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n*On 17 March 2006, the flight deck crew of a [[Monarch Airlines|Monarch]] Boeing 757-200 (Registration G-MONE) lost visual contact with the [[runway]] after passing the [[instrument approach|Visual Decision Point]] (VDP) while attempting to land at Gibraltar. During the subsequent [[go-around]], the crew did not follow the correct [[missed approach]] procedures but [[air traffic control]] (ATC) provided effective heading control to avoid striking high ground. The lowest altitude of the aircraft when over land was {{convert|2100|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The highest local ground elevation, just south of the [[airfield]], is {{convert|1420|ft|m|abbr=on}}.
