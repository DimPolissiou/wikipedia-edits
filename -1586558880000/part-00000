The first series was broadcast in six parts, at 11.30am on Fridays from 15 June 2007.  Its theme tune is \"[[I'm on My Way (The Proclaimers song)|I'm on My Way]]\".  The show was written by [[David Nobbs]].  A second series began broadcasting on 2 June 2008, including a re-recording of the theme song.  On 26 August 2009 a third series began airing, with the museum facing huge budget cuts due to the [[Late-2000s recession|economic downturn]].  Sadly, Walter Brindle is unable to bring himself to cut any staff, no matter how hard he tries.\n\n==Plot outline==\nRod Millet, the son of a well-known maker of biscuits, returns to the museum where he spent his adolescence retreating from the world.  He has had a varied career, including a stint as a cowherd in Arizona and a zinc miner in Bolivia.  He is the last candidate to be interviewed for the position of Deputy Curator of Painting and Sculpture.  None of the others were acceptable.  Rod is not particularly suitable, but he does play midfield in soccer, much to the delight of Director Brindle, and he has certain qualities that catch the eye of the Curator, Prunella Edgcombe.  The objections of the upper-crust Julian Crumb-Loosley are overridden.  Julian's main objection seems to be to Rod's working-class background.\n\nOn Rod's first day, the news arrives that the gallery is to be closed and the collection broken up.  Brindle is elated as he will be able to retire early.  Prunella is not so happy, but she and Julian quickly land other jobs.  Rod, realizing that the staff of the museum will not be so fortunate, decides to campaign to save the collection (however, the closure plot is wrapped up rather abruptly four episodes into the initial run, though Rod's efforts to attract more visitors continue into season two).\n\nIn the second series it is revealed that the museum's endowment originally came from the company \"Joshua Maltby & Sons\", a manufacturer of porcelain [[toilet]]s in [[Blackburn]].  The last of the Maltbys, Susie Maltby ([[Margaret Cabourn-Smith]]), appears as a new character.  She begins an affair with Brindle only to break it off when he falls for her and his wife leaves him.\n\nBy the start of the third series Susie is involved with Rod, and Prunella and Julian are married.  Prunella begins to dislike Julian's foibles while Rod defends Brindle against Susie's attempts to torment him.  Brindle resigns himself to a peaceful life alone, only to have his wife return unexpectedly.\n\n==Themes==\nThe show features many trademarks of David Nobbs's comedy style.  Characters tend to have long, almost poetic speeches, frequently reciting witty lists of ideas or qualities.  An example occurs in the first episode during the job interview.\n<blockquote>\nJulian : What do you think you would bring to the world of Art and culture, Mr. Millet?<br/>\nRod: Enthusiasm, natural good taste, dedication, energy, judgment, reliability, industriousness,  warmth, biscuits, stamina, a new perspective, a fresh eye, streetwise shrewdness, passion, perspicacity, practicality, punctuality, imagination, integrity and... humility.\n</blockquote>\nPhrases are repeated back and forth between characters in conversation, creating a rhythmic quality.  This example occurs when Des Wainwright, the Head of Security, stops Rod on his way into the museum on his first day.\n\n<blockquote>\nRod: When I get to my office, if I ever get to my office, I'm going to commend your diligence<br/>\n\nDes: Oh, you're going to commend my diligence, are you?<br/>\n\nRod: Don't you want to have your diligence commended?<br/>\n\nDes: I do. I very much want my diligence commended. I love having my diligence commended.  My diligence is all too rarely commended.<br/>\n\nRod: Good. So can I go and start work now?<br/>\n\nDes: Not so fast.  Now if I'm going to have my diligence commended, I'd better justify the commendation of my diligence, by being diligent!<br/>\n\nRod: I wish I'd never mentioned the commendation of your bloody diligence now!\n</blockquote>\n\nNobbs' characters frequently have verbal quirks.  In this series Julian Crumb-Loosely\nfrequently excuses some mannerism or failing of his by saying \"All the Crumb-Looselys are ...\".  This is similar to \"C.J.\" in \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\" who would begin sentences with \"I didn't get where I am today by ...\".\n\nActor [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]], who plays Director Brindle, has had a long association with Nobbs, beginning with [[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]].\n\n==Characters==\n* Rod Millet, son of the maker of \"Millet's Milky Marvels\" biscuits, is a rough diamond with a checkered career.

The museum is his second favourite place in the world, after [[White Hart Lane]]. His favourite artwork is [[Whistler's Mother|Whistler's Sister]].\n* Walter Brindle, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] is the Director of the Museum.  He has two great passions: telling people about his OBE, and beating the other London museums and galleries at football.\n* Prunella Edgcombe, \"single, unattached and available\", is the head Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the museum, and something of a predator.  After a brief dalliance Rod decides he does not wish to be manipulated, and tells her so.\n* Julian Crumb-Loosley, scion of a somewhat inbred aristocratic clan, is the \"Curator of everything except Painting and Sculpture\".  He constantly uses his family name as a touchstone, as in \"All the Crumb-Loosleys are partial to [[digestive biscuit|digestives]]\".  Julian is actually in love with Prunella, though she seems to know it before he does.  As she puts it \"All the Crumb-Loosleys are shy.  That's why they're so inbred.  They only like to be with people they already know, so they wind up marrying each other\".\n* Des Wainwright is the Head of Security at the museum.  A former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] man from [[Belfast]], he nevertheless admits to having a \"horribly subservient streak\".  He is currently with \"the third Mrs. Wainwright\" and does not want to have to find the fourth.

The complete work was premiered in [[Dresden]] on 4 December 1845. It is one of the most widely performed and recorded piano concertos from the Romantic period.\n\n== History ==\nSchumann had worked on several [[piano concerto]]s earlier. He began one in [[E-flat major]] in 1828, from 1829\u201331 he worked on one in [[F major]], and in 1839, he wrote one movement of a concerto in [[D minor]]. None of these works were completed.\n\nAlready on 10 January 1833, Schumann first expressed the idea of writing a Piano Concerto in A minor. In a letter to his future father-in-law, [[Friedrich Wieck]], he wrote: \"I think the piano concerto must be in C major or in A minor.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=313}}</ref> From 17\u201320 May 1841, Schumann wrote a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasy]] for piano and orchestra, his ''Phantasie'' in A minor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=314}}</ref> Schumann tried unsuccessfully to sell this one-movement piece to publishers. In August 1841 and January 1843 Schumann revised the piece, but was unsuccessful. His wife [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], an accomplished pianist, then urged him to expand it into a full piano concerto. In 1845 he added the ''[[Intermezzo]]'' and ''Allegro vivace'' to complete the work. It remained the only piano concerto that Schumann finished.\n\nThe premiere of the first movement (''Phantasie'') took place on 13 August 1841 at the [[Gewandhaus]] in Leipzig with Clara Schumann as the soloist. The complete three-movement version was premiered in Dresden on 4 December 1845, again with Clara Schumann, and the dedicatee [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as the conductor. Less than a month later, on 1 January 1846, the concerto was performed in Leipzig, conducted by [[Felix Mendelssohn]].\n\nAfter this concerto, Schumann wrote two other pieces for piano and orchestra: the ''[[Introduction and Allegro appassionato (Schumann)|Introduction and Allegro Appassionato]]'' in [[G major]], Op. 92, and the ''[[Introduction and Concert Allegro (Schumann)|Introduction and Allegro Concertante]]'' in [[D minor]], Op. 134.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, [[timpani]], [[string instrument|strings]], and solo piano. With this instrumentation Schumann chose the usual orchestration in early [[Romantic music]] for this concerto.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe piece, as marked in the score, is in three movements:\n\n# ''Allegro affettuoso'' (A minor)\n# ''Intermezzo: Andantino grazioso'' (F major)\n# ''Allegro vivace'' (A major)\n\nThere is no break between these last two movements (''attacca subito'').\n\nSchumann preferred that the movements be listed in concert programs as only two movements:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n#''Allegro affettuoso''\n#''Andantino and Rondo''\n\nThe three movement listing is the more common form used.\n\nThe duration of the concerto is about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on the interpretation.\n\n=== First movement: Allegro affettuoso ===\n{{Listen\n| filename      = Robert Schumann - Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in A minor, op. 54 - 1.

Allegro vivace\n| description3   = Performed by [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Witold Rowicki]], 1959. \n}}\nThe main movement of the concerto is marked ''Allegro affettuoso''; its origin lay in the one-movement fantasy written by Schumann in 1841, at whose core is the musical development of the conflict between the boisterous Florestan and the dreamy Eusebius, two characters Schumann often used to express the duality of being. The movement is set in 4/4 rhythm.\n\nThe piece starts with an energetic strike by strings and timpani, followed by a fierce, descending attack by the piano. This exposition chord is followed by a descending, rhythmically incisive chord progression of the solo piano corresponding to the ideal of the boisterous Florestan.\n\nOnly then, the main, dreamlike theme of Eusebius is introduced by the oboe along with other [[wind instrument]]s. The melody begins with the notes C\u2013H\u2013A\u2013A, which stand for the Italian spelling of the first name CHiArA of Schumann's wife Clara, who was the soloist at the world premiere of the piano concerto. After its introduction by the woodwinds, the theme is then given to the soloist. Schumann provides great variety with this theme.\n\nIn the course of the first movement Schumann varies this theme in many ways. He first offers it in the A minor key of the movement, then we hear it again in major, and we can also hear small snatches of the tune in a very slow, A-flat section. The orchestra and especially the clarinet is often used against the piano in this movement: while the solo instrument is dedicated to the main theme of the concerto, the strings begin to intone a Florestan-like, syncopated side thought (bar 41), which becomes more and more dominant, until a variation of the Eusebian main theme recurs quietly but urgently.\n\nThis is followed by a subsection labeled ''Animato''. At its end Schumann introduces a second theme, which does not reach the significance of the main theme.\n\nSubsequently, the [[Musical development|development]] of the main movement begins in the form of a dramatic lament (bar 156). This part almost reaches the position of an independent middle section. In A-flat major, the metrically altered main theme is referenced by piano arpeggios. Suddenly, however, chords of the Florestan theme interrupt the peace of the main theme. It comes to a struggle between the two ideals, which shapes the development further with rapid changes of soli and tutti.\n\nWith further dramatic progression and the [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] to A minor, the [[reprise]] is finally reached and cites the exposition almost tone for tone. The last tense progression brings forth a solo [[cadenza]] of monumental size and virtuosity (bar 402). It is undoubtedly the culmination of the movement.\n\nIn the coda, a throbbing, mysterious 2/4 rhythm dominates. This is turned into a fierce [[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze|Davidsb\u00fcndler-march]] a little later. The main movement of the concerto ends with four tutti chords.\n\n=== Second movement: Intermezzo - Andantino grazioso ===\nThis movement is keyed in F major. The piano and strings open up the piece with a small, delicate tune, which is heard throughout the movement before the cellos and later the other strings finally take the main theme, with the piano mainly used as accompaniment. The movement closes with small glimpses of the first movement's theme before moving straight into the third movement.\n\n=== Third movement: Allegro vivace ===\nThe movement opens with a huge run up the strings while the piano takes the main A major theme. Schumann shows great color and variety in this movement. Though the nominal time signature is 3/4, the movement in reality alternates between 6/4 and 3/2. The piece is cast in a hybrid sonata-rondo form with an extended and exciting coda, ending with a long timpani roll and a huge chord from the orchestra.\n\n== Intention ==\nDespite its three movements, the work has retained the character of a fantasy. The basic idea expressed in the work is that of yearning and happiness between two loving people. Schumann musically transforms his fight for Clara in this work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=313}}</ref> The main theme of the first movement is similar to the melody of the Florestan aria from [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s opera ''[[Fidelio]]''. Congruent with Beethoven, Schumann saw this theme as an expression of the intimate connection between loyalty and the struggle for freedom. In this way the concerto is, like many of his other compositions, based on Schumann's life long concern to fight against [[philistinism]] with musical means.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe contemporary reception of the work was consistently positive. Clara Schumann wrote after the premiere: \"... how rich in invention, how interesting from the beginning to the end, how fresh and what a beautiful coherent whole!\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=315}}</ref>\n\nSpecial emphasis was placed on the skilful, colorful and independent orchestral treatment, that would leave room for piano and orchestra alike. The [[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung|Leipzig Allgemeine Musikzeitung]] praised the composition on December 31: \"because, fortunately, it avoids the usual monotony of the genre, by giving, with great love and care, the obligatory room to orchestra without diminishing the role of the piano, and manages to beautifully link both independent parts together\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gerstmaier|first1=August|title=Robert Schumann - Klavierkonzert a-Moll, op. 54|date=1986|publisher=Wilhelm Fink Verlag|location=M\u00fcnchen|isbn=3770523431|page=40}}</ref>\n\nThe Dresdner Abendzeitung praised the \"quite independent, beautiful and interesting orchestral treatment\", and recognizes that the \"receding of the piano part into the background\" could certainly also be seen as progress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gerstmaier|first1=August|title=Robert Schumann - Klavierkonzert a-Moll, op. 54|date=1986|publisher=Wilhelm Fink Verlag|location=M\u00fcnchen|isbn=3770523431|page=39}}</ref>\n\nThe work may have been used as a model by [[Edvard Grieg]] in composing his own [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto]], also in [[A minor]]. Grieg's concerto, like Schumann's, employs a single powerful orchestral chord at its introduction before the piano's entrance with a similar descending flourish. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in turn used Grieg's concerto as a model for his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|first Piano Concerto]].\n\nIt has become one of the most widely performed and recorded piano concertos from the Romantic period.

The complete work was premiered in [[Dresden]] on 4 December 1845. It is one of the most widely performed and recorded piano concertos from the Romantic period.\n\n== History ==\nSchumann had worked on several [[piano concerto]]s earlier. He began one in [[E-flat major]] in 1828, from 1829\u201331 he worked on one in [[F major]], and in 1839, he wrote one movement of a concerto in [[D minor]]. None of these works were completed.\n\nAlready on 10 January 1833, Schumann first expressed the idea of writing a Piano Concerto in A minor. In a letter to his future father-in-law, [[Friedrich Wieck]], he wrote: \"I think the piano concerto must be in C major or in A minor.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=313}}</ref> From 17\u201320 May 1841, Schumann wrote a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasy]] for piano and orchestra, his ''Phantasie'' in A minor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sch\u00e4fer|first1=Hansj\u00fcrgen|title=Konzertbuch Orchestermusik|date=1958|publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag f\u00fcr Musik|location=Leipzig|page=314}}</ref> Schumann tried unsuccessfully to sell this one-movement piece to publishers. In August 1841 and January 1843 Schumann revised the piece, but was unsuccessful. His wife [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], an accomplished pianist, then urged him to expand it into a full piano concerto. In 1845 he added the ''[[Intermezzo]]'' and ''Allegro vivace'' to complete the work. It remained the only piano concerto that Schumann finished.\n\nThe premiere of the first movement (''Phantasie'') took place on 13 August 1841 at the [[Gewandhaus]] in Leipzig with Clara Schumann as the soloist. The complete three-movement version was premiered in Dresden on 4 December 1845, again with Clara Schumann, and the dedicatee [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as the conductor. Less than a month later, on 1 January 1846, the concerto was performed in Leipzig, conducted by [[Felix Mendelssohn]].\n\nAfter this concerto, Schumann wrote two other pieces for piano and orchestra: the ''[[Introduction and Allegro appassionato (Schumann)|Introduction and Allegro Appassionato]]'' in [[G major]], Op. 92, and the ''[[Introduction and Concert Allegro (Schumann)|Introduction and Allegro Concertante]]'' in [[D minor]], Op. 134.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, [[timpani]], [[string instrument|strings]], and solo piano. With this instrumentation Schumann chose the usual orchestration in early [[Romantic music]] for this concerto.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe piece, as marked in the score, is in three movements:\n\n# ''Allegro affettuoso'' (A minor)\n# ''Intermezzo: Andantino grazioso'' (F major)\n# ''Allegro vivace'' (A major)\n\nThere is no break between these last two movements (''attacca subito'').\n\nSchumann preferred that the movements be listed in concert programs as only two movements:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n#''Allegro affettuoso''\n#''Andantino and Rondo''\n\nThe three movement listing is the more common form used.\n\nThe duration of the concerto is about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on the interpretation.\n\n=== First movement: Allegro affettuoso ===\n{{Listen\n| filename      = Robert Schumann - Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in A minor, op. 54 - 1.

Allegro vivace\n| description3   = Performed by [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Witold Rowicki]], 1959. \n}}\nThe main movement of the concerto is marked ''Allegro affettuoso''; its origin lay in the one-movement fantasy written by Schumann in 1841, at whose core is the musical development of the conflict between the boisterous Florestan and the dreamy Eusebius, two characters Schumann often used to express the duality of being. The movement is set in 4/4 rhythm.\n\nThe piece starts with an energetic strike by strings and timpani, followed by a fierce, descending attack by the piano. This exposition chord is followed by a descending, rhythmically incisive chord progression of the solo piano corresponding to the ideal of the boisterous Florestan.\n\nOnly then, the main, dreamlike theme of Eusebius is introduced by the oboe along with other [[wind instrument]]s. The melody begins with the notes C\u2013H\u2013A\u2013A, which stand for the Italian spelling of the first name CHiArA of Schumann's wife Clara, who was the soloist at the world premiere of the piano concerto. After its introduction by the woodwinds, the theme is then given to the soloist. Schumann provides great variety with this theme.\n\nIn the course of the first movement Schumann varies this theme in many ways. He first offers it in the A minor key of the movement, then we hear it again in major, and we can also hear small snatches of the tune in a very slow, A-flat section. The orchestra and especially the clarinet is often used against the piano in this movement: while the solo instrument is dedicated to the main theme of the concerto, the strings begin to intone a Florestan-like, syncopated side thought (bar 41), which becomes more and more dominant, until a variation of the Eusebian main theme recurs quietly but urgently.\n\nThis is followed by a subsection labeled ''Animato''.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Northern Canaanites (Phoenicians) were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has their own additional 4 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types of Dabke include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n'''1.Dabket Arab''' is a slower and more sophisticated Dabke variation native to Akkar, Beqaa Valley and Bordering villages between Lebanon and Syria it's typically accompanied by a Mijwiz(double Reed instrument) and a tabel(Lebanese drum) and a Minjeira or Mizmar(types of flutes). \n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''2.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon.

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has their own additional 4 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types of Dabke include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n'''1.Dabket Arab''' is a slower and more sophisticated Dabke variation native to Akkar, Beqaa Valley and Bordering villages between Lebanon and Syria it's typically accompanied by a Mijwiz(double Reed instrument) and a tabel(Lebanese drum) and a Minjeira or Mizmar(types of flutes). \n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''2.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''3.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''4.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000. In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), World Music, Vol. 1: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, pp 391\u2013395. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail.

The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism. [...] Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\"</ref><ref name=\"Ward 1966\">{{cite web|url=http://www.panarchy.org/ward/organization.1966.html|last=Ward|first=Colin|year=1966|title=Anarchism as a Theory of Organization|accessdate=1 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325081119/http://www.panarchy.org/ward/organization.1966.html|archivedate=25 March 2010<!-- Added by DASHBot. -->}}</ref><ref>Ward, Colin (1966).

What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism.

It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production ([[socialism]]).{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=74}} They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]). Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.<ref>Paul, Ellen Frankel et al.

According to Hahnel, \"libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as [[social democracy]] and [[communism]]\" in the early 20th century. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International]], referred by Hahnel as the Libertarian International, was founded at the 1872 [[Congress of St. Imier]] a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague Congress]] of the [[First International]], referred by Hahnel as the Socialist International. This Libertarian International \"competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years\". For Hahnel, libertarian socialists \"played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911.

Libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely among members of society. Libertarian socialism and right-libertarian ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] differ in that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter believe in the freedom of choice within a capitalist framework, specifically under capitalist private property.<ref>Vrousalis (2011) p. 212</ref> This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize free creativity in a society in preference to free enterprise.<ref>Chomsky (2003) pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nWithin anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person.

Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.<ref>Chomsky (2004) p. 775</ref> Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.<ref>Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116</ref>\n\nIn lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.<ref>Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71\u201372, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}</ref> [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.\n\nContemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements<ref>Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179</ref> including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.<ref>Graeber, David. \"Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology\" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22\u201323, 26\u201329</ref> For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: \"I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal\".<ref>''The London Years'', 1956</ref>\n\nBecause libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state<ref>Hain, Peter \"Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots\" Chartist (August 2000)</ref> and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.\n\nProponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions.

Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations \u2013 from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self-critical and popularly connected communist organizations\".<ref>Chamsy el- Ojeili.

The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.<ref>Goldman, Emma.

While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by socialism. However, mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th- and 19th-century European socialism (such as Fourierian socialism)<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''.</ref><ref>\"[[Ricardian socialism]]\". The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought. 1987. p. 441</ref> while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins in early 18th century liberalism (such as the [[French Revolution]]).<ref name=\"graham2005-v1\">[[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]].

As such: \"The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: \"In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions\". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the \"instinct for freedom\") (Bakunin, Chomsky), or in Bakunin's words: \"All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\">{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The \"Advance Without Authority\": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy & Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages= 391\u2013413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Marxism ====\n{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}\n{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]\nMarxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: \"One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|[William] Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.<ref name=\"Beer, p. 256\">Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.</ref> The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: \"This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it\".<ref>''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.</ref> Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].\n\n[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]\nHowever, \"the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses\". For these socialists, \"[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius\". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period\u2014[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, \"not of a party or of a clique\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> However, within this line of thought \"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity. [...] The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs. [...] The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],<ref name=\"carr1985\">Carr, E.H. \u2013 The Bolshevik Revolution 1917\u20131923.

[[Blackwell Publishing]]</ref> Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[[\"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.\n\nFor many Marxian libertarian socialists, \"the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return \"behind Marx\" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy. [...] [[Karl Korsch]] [...] remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time\u2014as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]\u2014though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an \"authoritarian\", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call \"authoritarian communists\", or alternatively just \"authoritarians\". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|chapter-url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Gu\u00e9rin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Gu\u00e9rin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}</ref> he suggests the possibility \"that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy\".\n\nIn the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu\u2013Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\",<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133</ref> leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134</ref> Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.<ref>[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed).

The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term \"ultra-left\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further left than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as ultra-left the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. The term ultra-left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and peasants<ref>Peasant (\u519c\u6c11) was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s.

Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however socialists a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary ideas and habits among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \"turn over a new leaf\" after they had undergone \"[[Mind control|thought reform]]\", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution \"in which one class overthrows another class\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm \"Whither China?\"] by Yang Xiguang.</ref><ref>The 70s Collective, ed. 1996.

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of \"orthodox Marxism\" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of \"the transition\" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of \"[[Council Communism]]\" which saw the \"workers councils\" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being.\"[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref> Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].\n\n==== De Leonism ====\n{{main|De Leonism}}\nDe Leonism is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. \n\nIndustrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''\n\nThe highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.\n\n==== Council communism ====\n{{main|Council Communism}}\n<!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] -->\nCouncil communism is a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run bureaucratic socialism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\nThe Russian term for council is [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. The name [[Supreme Soviet]], by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a \"[[bourgeois]] revolution\" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists support workers' revolutions, but they oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.\n\n==== Left communism ====\n{{main|Left communism}}\n{{left communism sidebar|expanded=related}}\nLeft communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as the \"left of capital\", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist socialists]]) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example, [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n==== Johnson\u2013Forest tendency ====\n{{main|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency}}\nThe Johnson\u2013Forest tendency is a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson\u2013Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its name to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.\n\n==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====\n{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}\n[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}</ref> It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}</ref> Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis \"the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms\". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to \"place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.\n\n==== Situationist International ====\n{{main|Situationist International}}\n{{Situationists|related}}\nThe Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the \"construction of situations\", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.<ref>[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life ''The Revolution of Everyday Life''].</ref>\n\nThey fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.\n\nAfter publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,<ref name=\"SI12BeginningOfAnEra\">''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969</ref> the Situationist International was dissolved in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=1 June 2001 | accessdate=23 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104610/http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian [[autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism is a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi]].\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures.

D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].\n\nGuild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists \"stood for state ownership of industry, combined with \"workers' control\" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures\".<ref name=\"britannica.com Guild Socialism\"/>\n\nIn 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). For scholar Charles Masquerade, \"[i]t is by meeting such a twofold requirement that the libertarian socialism of G.D.H. Cole could be said to offer timely and sustainable avenues for the institutionalization of the liberal value of autonomy...By setting out to 'destroy this predominance of economic factors' (Cole 1980, 180) through the re-organization of key spheres of life into forms of associative action and coordination capable of giving the 'fullest development of functional organisation'...Cole effectively sought to turn political representation into a system actually capable of giving direct recognition to the multiplicity of interests making up highly complex and differentiated societies\".<ref>Charles Masquelier.

Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the [[Bourse du Travail]] (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer [[Commodity|commodities]].\n\nSyndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social arrangement, typically expounded by anarcho-syndicalism and [[De Leonism]] in which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT).<ref>''Principles of Syndcicalism'', Brown, Tom.

It is a body of ideas and principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term Gandhian economics was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|year=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600}}</ref> Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means, he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], decentralization of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections. Gandhi also had letter communication with Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and saw himself as his disciple.<ref>In 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]'', which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati.

While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.\n\nPolitically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities or cities organized in a [[Confederation|confederated]] fashion. The method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] and involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics&mdash;especially municipal elections&mdash;as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] in outlook.\n\n===== Democratic confederalism =====\n{{main|Democratic confederalism}}\n[[File:YPJ_fighters_3.jpg|thumb|Female fighters of the [[Women's Protection Units|YPJ]] play a significant combat role in Rojava]]\nDemocratic confederalism is the proposal of a libertarian socialist [[political system]] that \"is open towards other political groups and factions.

It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or \"parecon\" and [[participatory politics]] or \"parpolity\".\n\nParecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable \"credit\" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of \"Nested Councils\", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\n[[File:Takis_Fotopoulos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Takis Fotopoulos]]]]\nInclusive Democracy is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\n\nAccording to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' \"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\".<ref>Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 \"Beyond Social Democracy?

It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]]-based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.\n\nContemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism<ref>[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php \"Say you want an insurrection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013152611/http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php |date=2016-10-13 }} by [[Crimethinc]]</ref> and [[illegalism]].

Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war \"against the Mexican state\", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.\n\nThe group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879\u20131919 |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=11 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227033647/http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]]. The influence of Flores Mag\u00f3n on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or \"Land and liberty\", the title and maxim of Flores Mag\u00f3n's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Monta\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez\u2014later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917\u2014who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Mag\u00f3n at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.\n\nIn reference to inspirational figures, in nearly all EZLN villages exist murals accompanying images of Zapata, [[Che Guevara]] and Subcomandante Marcos.<ref>Baspineiro, Alex Contreras (7 May 2004).

Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process\".<ref>Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.</ref>\n\nThe association of the term communization with a self-identified [[ultra-left]] was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: \"insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself\".<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs \"A World Without Money\"] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (Quoted passage not included in this English extract.)</ref> The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauv\u00e9]] and ''Th\u00e9orie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as Fran\u00e7ois Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauv\u00e9 has attempted to fuse, critique and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]''), German Dutch council communism and the French perspectives associated with [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and the [[Situationist International]].<ref>\"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left.\"[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past \u2013 La Banquise]</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, a close yet not identical sense of communization was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with the revolution, considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities\u2014from squatting and setting up communes to simply sharing\u2014that would typically be understood as pre-revolutionary.<ref>\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge.

[...] Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\"</ref><ref name=\"Ward 1966\">{{cite web|url=http://www.panarchy.org/ward/organization.1966.html|last=Ward|first=Colin|year=1966|title=Anarchism as a Theory of Organization|accessdate=1 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325081119/http://www.panarchy.org/ward/organization.1966.html|archivedate=25 March 2010<!-- Added by DASHBot. -->}}</ref><ref>Ward, Colin (1966).

What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism.

It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production ([[socialism]]).{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=74}} They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]). Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.<ref>Paul, Ellen Frankel et al.

According to Hahnel, \"libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as [[social democracy]] and [[communism]]\" in the early 20th century. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International]], referred by Hahnel as the Libertarian International, was founded at the 1872 [[Congress of St. Imier]] a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague Congress]] of the [[First International]], referred by Hahnel as the Socialist International. This Libertarian International \"competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years\". For Hahnel, libertarian socialists \"played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911.

Libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely among members of society. Libertarian socialism and right-libertarian ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] differ in that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter believe in the freedom of choice within a capitalist framework, specifically under capitalist private property.<ref>Vrousalis (2011) p. 212</ref> This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize free creativity in a society in preference to free enterprise.<ref>Chomsky (2003) pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nWithin anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person.

Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.<ref>Chomsky (2004) p. 775</ref> Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.<ref>Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116</ref>\n\nIn lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.<ref>Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71\u201372, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}</ref> [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.\n\nContemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements<ref>Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179</ref> including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.<ref>Graeber, David. \"Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology\" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22\u201323, 26\u201329</ref> For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: \"I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal\".<ref>''The London Years'', 1956</ref>\n\nBecause libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state<ref>Hain, Peter \"Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots\" Chartist (August 2000)</ref> and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.\n\nProponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions.

Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations \u2013 from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self-critical and popularly connected communist organizations\".<ref>Chamsy el- Ojeili.

Along with many others, [[Errico Malatesta]] argued that the use of violence was necessary. As he put it in ''[[Umanit\u00e0 Nova]]'' (no. 125, September 6, 1921): {{quote|text=It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence that denies these means to the workers.<ref>[[Umanit\u00e0 Nova]], n. 125, September 6, 1921.

The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.<ref>Goldman, Emma.

While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by socialism. However, mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th- and 19th-century European socialism (such as Fourierian socialism)<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''.</ref><ref>\"[[Ricardian socialism]]\". The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought. 1987. p. 441</ref> while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins in early 18th century liberalism (such as the [[French Revolution]]).<ref name=\"graham2005-v1\">[[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [[Anarchism - A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] \u2013 Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE to 1939), Black Rose Books, 2005</ref>\n\nAnarchism posed an early challenge to the [[vanguardism]] and [[statism]] it detected in important sectors of the socialist movement. As such: \"The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: \"In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions\". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the \"instinct for freedom\") (Bakunin, Chomsky), or in Bakunin's words: \"All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\">{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The \"Advance Without Authority\": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy & Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages= 391\u2013413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Marxism ====\n{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}\n{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]\nMarxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: \"One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|[William] Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.<ref name=\"Beer, p. 256\">Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.</ref> The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: \"This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it\".<ref>''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.</ref> Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].\n\n[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]\nHowever, \"the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses\". For these socialists, \"[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius\". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period\u2014[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, \"not of a party or of a clique\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> However, within this line of thought \"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity. [...] The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs. [...] The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],<ref name=\"carr1985\">Carr, E.H. \u2013 The Bolshevik Revolution 1917\u20131923.

[[Blackwell Publishing]]</ref> Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[[\"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.\n\nFor many Marxian libertarian socialists, \"the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return \"behind Marx\" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy. [...] [[Karl Korsch]] [...] remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time\u2014as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]\u2014though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an \"authoritarian\", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call \"authoritarian communists\", or alternatively just \"authoritarians\". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|chapter-url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Gu\u00e9rin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Gu\u00e9rin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}</ref> he suggests the possibility \"that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy\".\n\nIn the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu\u2013Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\",<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133</ref> leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134</ref> Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.<ref>[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed).

The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term \"ultra-left\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further left than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as ultra-left the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. The term ultra-left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and peasants<ref>Peasant (\u519c\u6c11) was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the ultra-left, both peasants and urban workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.</ref> conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however socialists a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary ideas and habits among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \"turn over a new leaf\" after they had undergone \"[[Mind control|thought reform]]\", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution \"in which one class overthrows another class\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm \"Whither China?\"] by Yang Xiguang.</ref><ref>The 70s Collective, ed. 1996.

He thought that the \"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\", therefore \"''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\".

Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of \"orthodox Marxism\" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of \"the transition\" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of \"[[Council Communism]]\" which saw the \"workers councils\" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being.\"[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref> Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].\n\n==== De Leonism ====\n{{main|De Leonism}}\nDe Leonism is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. \n\nIndustrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''\n\nThe highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.\n\n==== Council communism ====\n{{main|Council Communism}}\n<!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] -->\nCouncil communism is a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run bureaucratic socialism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\nThe Russian term for council is [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. The name [[Supreme Soviet]], by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a \"[[bourgeois]] revolution\" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists support workers' revolutions, but they oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.\n\n==== Left communism ====\n{{main|Left communism}}\n{{left communism sidebar|expanded=related}}\nLeft communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as the \"left of capital\", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist socialists]]) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example, [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n==== Johnson\u2013Forest tendency ====\n{{main|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency}}\nThe Johnson\u2013Forest tendency is a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson\u2013Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its name to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.\n\n==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====\n{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}\n[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}</ref> It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}</ref> Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis \"the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms\". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to \"place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.\n\n==== Situationist International ====\n{{main|Situationist International}}\n{{Situationists|related}}\nThe Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the \"construction of situations\", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.<ref>[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life ''The Revolution of Everyday Life''].</ref>\n\nThey fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.\n\nAfter publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,<ref name=\"SI12BeginningOfAnEra\">''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969</ref> the Situationist International was dissolved in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=1 June 2001 | accessdate=23 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104610/http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian [[autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism is a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi]].\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory which draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working and socialization in the workplace.\n\nAll this influenced the German and Dutch autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists.

D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].\n\nGuild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists \"stood for state ownership of industry, combined with \"workers' control\" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures\".<ref name=\"britannica.com Guild Socialism\"/>\n\nIn 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). For scholar Charles Masquerade, \"[i]t is by meeting such a twofold requirement that the libertarian socialism of G.D.H. Cole could be said to offer timely and sustainable avenues for the institutionalization of the liberal value of autonomy...By setting out to 'destroy this predominance of economic factors' (Cole 1980, 180) through the re-organization of key spheres of life into forms of associative action and coordination capable of giving the 'fullest development of functional organisation'...Cole effectively sought to turn political representation into a system actually capable of giving direct recognition to the multiplicity of interests making up highly complex and differentiated societies\".<ref>Charles Masquelier.

Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the [[Bourse du Travail]] (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer [[Commodity|commodities]].\n\nSyndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social arrangement, typically expounded by anarcho-syndicalism and [[De Leonism]] in which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT).<ref>''Principles of Syndcicalism'', Brown, Tom.

It is a body of ideas and principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term Gandhian economics was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|year=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600}}</ref> Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means, he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], decentralization of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections. Gandhi also had letter communication with Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and saw himself as his disciple.<ref>In 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]'', which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati.

While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.\n\nPolitically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities or cities organized in a [[Confederation|confederated]] fashion. The method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] and involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics&mdash;especially municipal elections&mdash;as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] in outlook.\n\n===== Democratic confederalism =====\n{{main|Democratic confederalism}}\n[[File:YPJ_fighters_3.jpg|thumb|Female fighters of the [[Women's Protection Units|YPJ]] play a significant combat role in Rojava]]\nDemocratic confederalism is the proposal of a libertarian socialist [[political system]] that \"is open towards other political groups and factions.

It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or \"parecon\" and [[participatory politics]] or \"parpolity\".\n\nParecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable \"credit\" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of \"Nested Councils\", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\n[[File:Takis_Fotopoulos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Takis Fotopoulos]]]]\nInclusive Democracy is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\n\nAccording to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' \"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\".<ref>Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 \"Beyond Social Democracy?

It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]]-based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.\n\nContemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism<ref>[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php \"Say you want an insurrection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013152611/http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php |date=2016-10-13 }} by [[Crimethinc]]</ref> and [[illegalism]].

Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war \"against the Mexican state\", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.\n\nThe group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879\u20131919 |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=11 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227033647/http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]]. The influence of Flores Mag\u00f3n on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or \"Land and liberty\", the title and maxim of Flores Mag\u00f3n's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Monta\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez\u2014later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917\u2014who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Mag\u00f3n at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.\n\nIn reference to inspirational figures, in nearly all EZLN villages exist murals accompanying images of Zapata, [[Che Guevara]] and Subcomandante Marcos.<ref>Baspineiro, Alex Contreras (7 May 2004).

Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process\".<ref>Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.</ref>\n\nThe association of the term communization with a self-identified [[ultra-left]] was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: \"insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself\".<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs \"A World Without Money\"] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (Quoted passage not included in this English extract.)</ref> The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauv\u00e9]] and ''Th\u00e9orie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as Fran\u00e7ois Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauv\u00e9 has attempted to fuse, critique and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]''), German Dutch council communism and the French perspectives associated with [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and the [[Situationist International]].<ref>\"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left.\"[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past \u2013 La Banquise]</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, a close yet not identical sense of communization was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with the revolution, considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities\u2014from squatting and setting up communes to simply sharing\u2014that would typically be understood as pre-revolutionary.<ref>\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge.
