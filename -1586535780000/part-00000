His early education began in the traditional style at home and continued in schools in Malabar, till he passed the Arts examination with a first class from the Provincial School at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. Then he joined the Presidency College, Madras. In 1877 he took his Arts degree, and two years later secured the Law degree from the Madras Law College.\n\n==Career==\nNair started as a lawyer in 1880 in the High Court of Madras. In 1884, the [[Madras Province|Madras]] Government appointed him as a member of the Committee for an enquiry into the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|state of Malabar]]. Till 1908, he was the [[Advocate-General]] to the Government and an Acting Judge from time to time. In 1908, he became a permanent Judge in the High Court of Madras and held the post till 1915. He was a part of the bench that tried [[Collector Ashe]] murder case along with [[C. A.

In recognition of his services, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Indian Empire]] by the King-Emperor in 1904<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27688/supplements/4010 ''London Gazette'', 21 June 1904]</ref> and in 1912 he was knighted.<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28626/supplements/5082 ''London Gazette'', 12 July 1912]</ref> He became a member of the [[Viceroy's Executive Council|Viceroy's Council]] in 1915 with the charge of the Education portfolio. As member, he wrote in 1919 two famous Minutes of Dissent in the Despatches on Indian Constitutional Reforms, pointing out the various defects of British rule in India and suggesting reforms. For an Indian to offer such criticism and make such demands was incredible in those days. The British government accepted most of his recommendations.Nair resigned from the Viceroy's Council in the aftermath of Jalianwalabagh massacre in April 13, 1919,but went to London and joined the Indian Council of States, as a member, remaining in the position till 1925. While there, he wrote the infamous book, ''Gandhi and Anarchy'',in 1922,tarnishing the popular image of Mahatma Gandhi. It is the only book he has written. Nair was a vehement critic of Gandhi,as pointed out by Ramachandra Guha,in ''Gandhi:The Years that Changed the World''.Ramachadran,Editor and writer had pointed out in Madhyamam Weekly that Nair had been a British agent. While Rabindra Nath Tagore returned the knighthood after Jalianwala bagh massacre, Nair kept and cherished it.\n\nHe played an active part in the Indian National movement which was gathering force in those days. In 1897, when the First Provincial Conference met in Madras, he was invited to preside over it. The same year, when the [[Indian National Congress]] assembled at [[Amaravathi]], he was chosen its president. In a masterly address, he referred to the highhandedness of foreign administration, called for reforms and asked for self-government for India with Dominion Status. In 1900, he was a member of the [[Madras Legislative Council]]. His official life from 1908 to 1921 interrupted his activities as a free political worker. In 1928, he was the President of the Indian Central Committee to co-operate with the [[Simon Commission]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gautam Sharma|title=Nationalisation of the Indian Army, 1885\u20131947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siDiyYi8k74C&pg=PA113|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-555-2|page=113}}</ref> The Committee prepared a well-argued report asking for [[Dominion#India and Pakistan|Dominion Status for India]].

His early education began in the traditional style at home and continued in schools in Malabar, till he passed the Arts examination with a first class from the Provincial School at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. Then he joined the Presidency College, Madras. In 1877 he took his Arts degree, and two years later secured the Law degree from the Madras Law College.\n\n==Career==\nNair started as a lawyer in 1880 in the High Court of Madras. In 1884, the [[Madras Province|Madras]] Government appointed him as a member of the Committee for an enquiry into the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|state of Malabar]]. Till 1908, he was the [[Advocate-General]] to the Government and an Acting Judge from time to time. In 1908, he became a permanent Judge in the High Court of Madras and held the post till 1915.

As member, he wrote in 1919 two famous Minutes of Dissent in the Despatches on Indian Constitutional Reforms, pointing out the various defects of British rule in India and suggesting reforms. For an Indian to offer such criticism and make such demands was incredible in those days. The British government accepted most of his recommendations.Nair resigned from the Viceroy's Council in the aftermath of Jalianwalabagh massacre in April 13,1919,but went to London and joined the Indian Council of States,as a member,remaining in the position till 1925.While there,he wrote the infamous book,''Gandhi and Anarchy'',in 1922,tarnishing the popular image of Mahatma Gandhi.It is the only book he has written.Nair was a vehement critic of Gandhi,as pointed out by Ramachandra Guha,in ''Gandhi:The Years that Changed the World''.Ramachadran,Editor and writer had pointed out in Madhyamam Weekly that Nair had been a British agent.While Rabindra Nath Tagore returned the knighthood after Jalianwala bagh massacre,Nair kept and cherished it.\n\nHe played an active part in the Indian National movement which was gathering force in those days. In 1897, when the First Provincial Conference met in Madras, he was invited to preside over it. The same year, when the [[Indian National Congress]] assembled at [[Amaravathi]], he was chosen its president. In a masterly address, he referred to the highhandedness of foreign administration, called for reforms and asked for self-government for India with Dominion Status. In 1900, he was a member of the [[Madras Legislative Council]]. His official life from 1908 to 1921 interrupted his activities as a free political worker. In 1928, he was the President of the Indian Central Committee to co-operate with the [[Simon Commission]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gautam Sharma|title=Nationalisation of the Indian Army, 1885\u20131947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siDiyYi8k74C&pg=PA113|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-555-2|page=113}}</ref> The Committee prepared a well-argued report asking for [[Dominion#India and Pakistan|Dominion Status for India]].

Other officers were involved in tipping off the tow trucks of the accident locations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Drivers licensing ===\nCanadian provinces mandate written and road tests (graduated licensing) to obtain license to drive automobiles. Truck drivers must undergo specialized training and obtain a commercial license. Some provinces, such as Ontario, have privatized drivers licensing, while others offer it as a public service. There exist corruption at various levels of drivers licensing.\n\nA dangerous corruption is when non-qualified people obtain drivers licenses by bribing licensing officers.<ref name=\"bribing_drivers_license_employees\"/><ref name=\"fake_drivers_licensing\"/> Issuing of fake in-class driving lesson certificates is another scam related to obtaining licensing.

The overcharges exceeded $40 billion. As noted by the Auditor General of Canada in her 2004 report:\n:Parliament did not intend, in my view, that the Account would accumulate a surplus beyond what could reasonably be spent for employment insurance purposes, given the existing benefit structure, while also providing for an economic downturn.

The mandate of the [[Public Service Commission of Canada|Public Service Commission]] is to protect the public service from political interference and \"ensure professional, non-partisan public service\".<ref name=\"psc\"/> The Office of Public Service Values and Ethics is tasked with implementing values, ethics and policies to prevent corruption.<ref name=\"best_practices\"/>\n\nThe [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] defeated in the last election, has been criticized for political interference in an array of administrative bodies including Statistics Canada, Elections Canada, the Canadian Military Complaints Commission, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Public Works and the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"independence_of_public_service_study\"/>\n\n=== Auditor General, Ombudsman ===\nCanada's federal and provincial governments have independent and strong [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] offices. The Auditor-General reports to the Parliament, not to the cabinet, and conducts annual and special audits to examine the government's activities and hold it to account. Auditor-General reports have brought to light major scandals, corruption, waste and inefficiencies, and led to changes in governments.\n\nOmbudsman offices are tasked with investigating public complaints about government. Special ombudsmans or commissioners are tasked with investigating and reporting to Parliament about key areas. The [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]], Environment and Sustainable Development Commissioner and [[Information Commissioner of Canada]] are examples of these special offices.\n\n=== Civilian oversight bodies ===\nCivilian oversight bodies are used to hold account, to check power and provide input for government and industry bodies. They are specially used to hold account the police, RCMP, military and [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]].\n\nIn 2012, Office of the Inspector General, which was a key oversight body for the Canada's spy agency CSIS was abolished by the Conservative government.<ref name=\"csis_overseer_abolished\"/> The government said the oversight functions were consolidated within the civilian [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]].\n\n=== ''Access to Information Act'' ===\nCanada's ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' came into force in 1983. However, in recent years the legislation has been severely criticized to be outdated and in-effective. Centre for Law and Democracy ranks Canada 56th out of 95 countries in terms of the strength of the Access to Information legislation.<ref name=\"access_to_information_blocked\"/> Both Federal and various Provincial and Territorial access to information systems are overburdened, in part, by the refusal of many governments and agencies to informally release various data either as a matter of routine course or upon informal request, instead demanding that written requests be made pursuant to relevant access to information legislation, subsequently triggering a cumbersome and time-consuming formal process for frequently trivial and even obviously public information. As of 2015 there are thousands of individuals employed full-time throughout all levels of government and their agencies tasked with processing formal requests for access to information; this represents a cost to the Canadian taxpayer of hundreds of millions of dollars annually and does not include additional expenses including outside legal and other professional opinions, tribunal hearings, motions and appeals in courts, multiple access to information commissions and tribunals across the country, and various other expenses that likely bring the annual cost to the taxpayer into the billions of dollars.\n\nAn investigation by the Information Commissioner of Canada has found that the conservative government's staff have systematically interfered with the processing of access to information requests.<ref name=\"tories_intefer_with_right_to_information\"/>\n\n=== Conflict of Interest laws ===\nAll levels of governments enforce conflict of interest laws for civil servants and politicians. The laws generally require disclosure of actual or perceived conflict of interests and appropriate measures, such as recusal from decisions.<ref name=\"conflick_of_interest\"/>\n\nConflict of interest laws have been used to highlight an array of improper dealings by politicians. For instance, in 2015 an Ethics Commissioner report found \"Government Services Minister Diane Finley breached conflict-of-interest rules by giving preferential treatment and federal funding to a project\" that received \"one of its lowest ratings\" in an assessment done by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.<ref name=\"conflict-of-interest\"/> The project proposal was submitted by the Canadian Federation of Chabad Lubavitch by Ottawa rabbi Chaim Mendelsohn, who had close ties to the Conservative party, the Prime Minister's Office and then-foreign affairs minister John Baird.\"<ref name=\"conflict-of-interest\"/>\n\n=== Federal Accountability Act ===\n[[Federal Accountability Act]] is a major anti-corruption legislation passed in 2006 by the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|Harper Conservative government]].  It introduced several mechanisms to combat corruption including [[Commissioner of Lobbying]], [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]], [[Public Sector Integrity Commissioner]], [[Ethics Commissioner (Canada)|Ethics Commissioner]], limits to election donations and enhancement of lobbying rules.\n\n=== Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act ===\n[[Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (Canada)|Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act]] is a [[whistleblower]] protection act. The act \"provides a confidential process for employees in Canada's federal public sector to come forward with any information about possible wrongdoing within the federal government and state corporations\", except [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and the Canadian Forces.\n\n=== Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act ===\nCanada signed and agreed to implement the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] and the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]. The [[Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act]] (CFPOA) was enacted in 1999. The CFPOA applies to persons and companies, aiming to prevent and punish the acts of bribery of foreign public officials to obtain or retain a business advantage. Companies have to develop effective compliance programs with focus on specific areas relevant for the CFPOA.\n\nThe aim of the law is to monitor, punish and prevent bribery and other criminal acts being committed by Canadians and Canadian companies in foreign countries. In 2014, Ottawa consultant Nazir Karigar was the first person to be convicted under this law. He was convicted for the Air India bribery scheme.\n\nA 2013 progress report indicates that Canada has failed to implement many of the recommendations and earns an overall score of \"Moderate\". OECD criticized Canada for lack of prosecutions and lack of resource allocation to address corruption.\n\n=== Opendata, open government, and transparency initiatives ===\nCanadian governments at all levels and citizen organizations have undertaken various [[Open data in Canada|Open data]], [[Open government]] and transparency initiatives. The Open Government Strategy was launched by the federal government in March 2011. Various datasets have been released under municipal open data initiatives such as [[Toronto Open Data]]. Sharing of MP/MPP/Councilor expenses online, sunshine lists, posting detail program budgets and expenditures online and crime statistics are some examples of open data being released online. Open data has increased public scrutiny of abuses, helping monitor, prosecute and prevent corruption.\n\n=== International conventions and transparency initiatives ===\nCanada has ratified [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]].\n\nThe government of Canada is part of the multilateral [[Open Government Partnership]] initiative. Canada joined the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative]] (IATI) in 2011. Canada was a supporting country to the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]], and it intends to implement the EITI.\n\n=== First Nations Financial Transparency Act ===\nThe First Nations Financial Transparency Act was created in 2013 by the Harper Conservative government, with the purpose of increasing financial transparency in First Nations Communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/first-nations-financial-transparency-act-becomes-law-reserve-audits-chiefs-salaries-to-be-publicized|title=First Nations financial transparency act becomes law; reserve audits, chiefs' salaries to be publicized|accessdate=August 24, 2016|date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The First Nations Financial Transparency Act requires First Nation bands to publicly disclose their financial statements, including salary information of their councillors. Disclosure of this information has highlighted relatively high salaries of many chiefs, in comparison to extreme poor living conditions of their members. For instance, Shuswap band has 87 on-reserve members. Its Chief Paul Sam earned $202,413 tax free salary while many band members endured winters without water or electricity.<ref name=\"FNFTA\"/> First Nations Financial Transparency Act has promoted higher vigilance regarding band leadership's activities and financial management by members and fellow councilors.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] [[Carolyn Bennett]] announced that the Liberal government will stop enforcing the Act, and will \"suspend any court actions against First Nations who have not complied with the Act\", releasing funds withheld from First Nations communities that have not complied with the Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1024739|title=Statement by the Honourable Carolyn Bennett on the First Nations Financial Transparency Act|date=December 18, 2015|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Integrity Regime ===\nGovernment of Canada's Integrity Regime prohibits the federal government from doing business with any company if \"they, or members of their board of directors have been convicted or absolutely/conditionally discharged in the last three years\" of various corruption and malpractice related offenses including income and excise tax evasion, secret commissions and bribing a foreign public official.<ref name=\"integrity_regime\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Crime in Canada]]\n* [[Corruption by country]]\n*[[Corruption in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"canada_at_bottom_in_fighting_bribery\">{{Cite web | title = Anti-Corruption Policy in Canada and Kazakhstan: Bottom-Up Vs.

Other officers were involved in tipping off the tow trucks of the accident locations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Drivers licensing ===\nCanadian provinces mandate written and road tests (graduated licensing) to obtain license to drive automobiles. Truck drivers must undergo specialized training and obtain a commercial license. Some provinces, such as Ontario, have privatized drivers licensing, while others offer it as a public service. There exist corruption at various levels of drivers licensing.\n\nA dangerous corruption is when non-qualified people obtain drivers licenses by bribing licensing officers.<ref name=\"bribing_drivers_license_employees\"/><ref name=\"fake_drivers_licensing\"/> Issuing of fake in-class driving lesson certificates is another scam related to obtaining licensing. In-class driver lesson certificates are used to get discount rates from insurance companies.\n\nA Toronto Star investigation found that \"truck-driver testing centre is letting learners earn their licences without being required to drive on a major expressway\".<ref name=\"truck_driving_scheme\"/> Further more, many driving schools offer in-vehicle \"lessons even though they are not authorized  by the province to do so\".<ref name=\"truck_driving_scheme\"/><ref name=\"truck_driving_unregulated_schools\"/>\n\nAnother fraud associated with drivers licensing is issuance of fake drivers licenses.

Buyers, sellers, realtors, developers, lawyers, mortgage brokers and banks have been implicated in various fraud and corruption cases.<ref name=\"mortgage_fraud\"/> Money laundering, lying about income and occupation, fake bids, value falsification, title fraud and falsely claiming as owner-occupied are common real estate frauds in Canada.<ref name=\"law_society_report\"/><ref name=\"mortgage_fraud_definition\"/>\n\nMoney laundering is likely in the real estate sector of major Canadian cities. Chinese buyers are suspected of laundering money through the Vancouver real estate market in large numbers, with the help of major Canadian banks.<ref name=\"vancover_real_estate_money_laundering\"/> According to a ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' investigation, \"some Canadian banks allow wealthy Asian investors to skirt Chinese law by helping them bring in large amounts of money, which is then often used to buy real estate in Vancouver.\"<ref name=\"banks_bend_rules\"/> A report by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada indicates \"dramatic under-reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious transactions\" in the Vancouver real estate sector.<ref name=\"vancover_real_estate_money_laundering\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Equifax uncovered $400 million of mortgage fraud in Canada, which experts suspect represents only a fraction of the cheating taking place in the country's real estate market\".<ref name=\"eqifax_realestate_fraud_report\"/>\n\nThe [[Panama Papers]] leak of documents from the law offices of [[Mossack Fonseca]] brought to light a rather high level of referrals by Canadian banks to the Panamanian offshore specialist. The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) sent 370+ clients to Mossack Fonseca over the years, for example, but they underlined that the bank did not help its customers to avoid taxes or hide income. \"We have an extensive due diligence process...

The overcharges exceeded $40 billion. As noted by the Auditor General of Canada in her 2004 report:\n:Parliament did not intend, in my view, that the Account would accumulate a surplus beyond what could reasonably be spent for employment insurance purposes, given the existing benefit structure, while also providing for an economic downturn. Accordingly, in my opinion, the Government did not observe the intent of the Employment Insurance Act.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Auditor General of Canada|title=2004 Public Accounts of the Government of Canada|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/201/301/public_accounts_can/pdf/2004/v1pa04e.pdf|accessdate=January 26, 2017|pages=2. 29 to 2. 30|language=English}}</ref>\n\nOn December 11, 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the overcharges were unlawful.

Canada (Attorney General)'':\n\n:[96] For these reasons, I would therefore allow the appeals in part and declare that the versions of ss. 66.1  and 66.3  of the Employment Insurance Act  that applied in 2002, 2003 and 2005 are invalid and that employers' and employees' premiums for 2002, 2003 and 2005 were collected unlawfully.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux v.

The mandate of the [[Public Service Commission of Canada|Public Service Commission]] is to protect the public service from political interference and \"ensure professional, non-partisan public service\".<ref name=\"psc\"/> The Office of Public Service Values and Ethics is tasked with implementing values, ethics and policies to prevent corruption.<ref name=\"best_practices\"/>\n\nThe [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] defeated in the last election, has been criticized for political interference in an array of administrative bodies including Statistics Canada, Elections Canada, the Canadian Military Complaints Commission, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Public Works and the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"independence_of_public_service_study\"/>\n\n=== Auditor General, Ombudsman ===\nCanada's federal and provincial governments have independent and strong [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] offices. The Auditor-General reports to the Parliament, not to the cabinet, and conducts annual and special audits to examine the government's activities and hold it to account. Auditor-General reports have brought to light major scandals, corruption, waste and inefficiencies, and led to changes in governments.\n\nOmbudsman offices are tasked with investigating public complaints about government. Special ombudsmans or commissioners are tasked with investigating and reporting to Parliament about key areas. The [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]], Environment and Sustainable Development Commissioner and [[Information Commissioner of Canada]] are examples of these special offices.\n\n=== Civilian oversight bodies ===\nCivilian oversight bodies are used to hold account, to check power and provide input for government and industry bodies. They are specially used to hold account the police, RCMP, military and [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]].\n\nIn 2012, Office of the Inspector General, which was a key oversight body for the Canada's spy agency CSIS was abolished by the Conservative government.<ref name=\"csis_overseer_abolished\"/> The government said the oversight functions were consolidated within the civilian [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]].\n\n=== ''Access to Information Act'' ===\nCanada's ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' came into force in 1983. However, in recent years the legislation has been severely criticized to be outdated and in-effective. Centre for Law and Democracy ranks Canada 56th out of 95 countries in terms of the strength of the Access to Information legislation.<ref name=\"access_to_information_blocked\"/> Both Federal and various Provincial and Territorial access to information systems are overburdened, in part, by the refusal of many governments and agencies to informally release various data either as a matter of routine course or upon informal request, instead demanding that written requests be made pursuant to relevant access to information legislation, subsequently triggering a cumbersome and time-consuming formal process for frequently trivial and even obviously public information. As of 2015 there are thousands of individuals employed full-time throughout all levels of government and their agencies tasked with processing formal requests for access to information; this represents a cost to the Canadian taxpayer of hundreds of millions of dollars annually and does not include additional expenses including outside legal and other professional opinions, tribunal hearings, motions and appeals in courts, multiple access to information commissions and tribunals across the country, and various other expenses that likely bring the annual cost to the taxpayer into the billions of dollars.\n\nAn investigation by the Information Commissioner of Canada has found that the conservative government's staff have systematically interfered with the processing of access to information requests.<ref name=\"tories_intefer_with_right_to_information\"/>\n\n=== Conflict of Interest laws ===\nAll levels of governments enforce conflict of interest laws for civil servants and politicians. The laws generally require disclosure of actual or perceived conflict of interests and appropriate measures, such as recusal from decisions.<ref name=\"conflick_of_interest\"/>\n\nConflict of interest laws have been used to highlight an array of improper dealings by politicians. For instance, in 2015 an Ethics Commissioner report found \"Government Services Minister Diane Finley breached conflict-of-interest rules by giving preferential treatment and federal funding to a project\" that received \"one of its lowest ratings\" in an assessment done by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.<ref name=\"conflict-of-interest\"/> The project proposal was submitted by the Canadian Federation of Chabad Lubavitch by Ottawa rabbi Chaim Mendelsohn, who had close ties to the Conservative party, the Prime Minister's Office and then-foreign affairs minister John Baird.\"<ref name=\"conflict-of-interest\"/>\n\n=== Federal Accountability Act ===\n[[Federal Accountability Act]] is a major anti-corruption legislation passed in 2006 by the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|Harper Conservative government]].  It introduced several mechanisms to combat corruption including [[Commissioner of Lobbying]], [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]], [[Public Sector Integrity Commissioner]], [[Ethics Commissioner (Canada)|Ethics Commissioner]], limits to election donations and enhancement of lobbying rules.\n\n=== Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act ===\n[[Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (Canada)|Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act]] is a [[whistleblower]] protection act. The act \"provides a confidential process for employees in Canada's federal public sector to come forward with any information about possible wrongdoing within the federal government and state corporations\", except [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and the Canadian Forces.\n\n=== Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act ===\nCanada signed and agreed to implement the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] and the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]. The [[Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act]] (CFPOA) was enacted in 1999. The CFPOA applies to persons and companies, aiming to prevent and punish the acts of bribery of foreign public officials to obtain or retain a business advantage. Companies have to develop effective compliance programs with focus on specific areas relevant for the CFPOA.\n\nThe aim of the law is to monitor, punish and prevent bribery and other criminal acts being committed by Canadians and Canadian companies in foreign countries. In 2014, Ottawa consultant Nazir Karigar was the first person to be convicted under this law. He was convicted for the Air India bribery scheme.\n\nA 2013 progress report indicates that Canada has failed to implement many of the recommendations and earns an overall score of \"Moderate\". OECD criticized Canada for lack of prosecutions and lack of resource allocation to address corruption.\n\n=== Opendata, open government, and transparency initiatives ===\nCanadian governments at all levels and citizen organizations have undertaken various [[Open data in Canada|Open data]], [[Open government]] and transparency initiatives. The Open Government Strategy was launched by the federal government in March 2011. Various datasets have been released under municipal open data initiatives such as [[Toronto Open Data]]. Sharing of MP/MPP/Councilor expenses online, sunshine lists, posting detail program budgets and expenditures online and crime statistics are some examples of open data being released online. Open data has increased public scrutiny of abuses, helping monitor, prosecute and prevent corruption.\n\n=== International conventions and transparency initiatives ===\nCanada has ratified [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]].\n\nThe government of Canada is part of the multilateral [[Open Government Partnership]] initiative. Canada joined the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative]] (IATI) in 2011. Canada was a supporting country to the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]], and it intends to implement the EITI.\n\n=== First Nations Financial Transparency Act ===\nThe First Nations Financial Transparency Act was created in 2013 by the Harper Conservative government, with the purpose of increasing financial transparency in First Nations Communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/first-nations-financial-transparency-act-becomes-law-reserve-audits-chiefs-salaries-to-be-publicized|title=First Nations financial transparency act becomes law; reserve audits, chiefs' salaries to be publicized|accessdate=August 24, 2016|date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The First Nations Financial Transparency Act requires First Nation bands to publicly disclose their financial statements, including salary information of their councillors. Disclosure of this information has highlighted relatively high salaries of many chiefs, in comparison to extreme poor living conditions of their members. For instance, Shuswap band has 87 on-reserve members. Its Chief Paul Sam earned $202,413 tax free salary while many band members endured winters without water or electricity.<ref name=\"FNFTA\"/> First Nations Financial Transparency Act has promoted higher vigilance regarding band leadership's activities and financial management by members and fellow councilors.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] [[Carolyn Bennett]] announced that the Liberal government will stop enforcing the Act, and will \"suspend any court actions against First Nations who have not complied with the Act\", releasing funds withheld from First Nations communities that have not complied with the Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1024739|title=Statement by the Honourable Carolyn Bennett on the First Nations Financial Transparency Act|date=December 18, 2015|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Integrity Regime ===\nGovernment of Canada's Integrity Regime prohibits the federal government from doing business with any company if \"they, or members of their board of directors have been convicted or absolutely/conditionally discharged in the last three years\" of various corruption and malpractice related offenses including income and excise tax evasion, secret commissions and bribing a foreign public official.<ref name=\"integrity_regime\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Crime in Canada]]\n* [[Corruption by country]]\n*[[Corruption in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"canada_at_bottom_in_fighting_bribery\">{{Cite web | title = Anti-Corruption Policy in Canada and Kazakhstan: Bottom-Up Vs.

An MQTT broker is a server that receives all messages from the clients and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients.<ref name=\"message broker- client\">{{cite web |last1=Yuan |first1=Michael |title=Getting to know MQTT |url=https://developer.ibm.com/articles/iot-mqtt-why-good-for-iot/ |website=IBM Developer |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> An MQTT client is any device (from a micro controller up to a full-fledged server) that runs an MQTT library and connects to an MQTT broker over a network.<ref name=\"MQTT client - broker\">{{cite web |title=Client, Broker / Server and Connection Establishment - MQTT Essentials: Part 3 |url=https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-3-client-broker-connection-establishment/ |website=hivemq.com |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nInformation is organized in a hierarchy of '''topics'''.  When a publisher has a new item of data to distribute, it sends a control message with the data to the connected broker.  The broker then distributes the information to any clients that have subscribed to that topic. The publisher does not need to have any data on the number or locations of subscribers, and subscribers, in turn, do not have to be configured with any data about the publishers. \n\nIf a broker receives a message on a topic for which there are no current subscribers, the broker discards the message unless the publisher of the message designated the message as a '''retained message'''. A retained message is a normal MQTT message with the retained flag set to true. The broker stores the last retained message and the corresponding QoS for the selected topic. Each client that subscribes to a topic pattern that matches the topic of the retained message receives the retained message immediately after they subscribe. The broker stores only one retained message per topic.<ref name=\"MQTT retained messages\">{{cite web |title=Retained Messages - MQTT Essentials: Part 8 |url=https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/ |website=hivemq.com |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> This allows new subscribers to a topic to receive the most current value rather than waiting for the next update from a publisher. \n\nWhen a publishing client first connects to the broker, it can set up a default message to be sent to subscribers if the broker detects that the publishing client has unexpectedly disconnected from the broker. \n\nClients only interact with a broker, but a system may contain several broker servers that exchange data based on their current subscribers' topics. \n\nA minimal MQTT control message can be as little as two bytes of data.  A control message can carry nearly 256 megabytes of data if needed.  There are fourteen defined message types used to connect and disconnect a client from a broker, to publish data, to acknowledge receipt of data, and to supervise the connection between client and server. \n\nMQTT relies on the TCP protocol for data transmission. A variant, MQTT-SN, is used over other transports such as UDP or Bluetooth. \n\nMQTT sends connection credentials in plain text format and does not include any measures for security or authentication.  This can be provided by the underlying TCP transport using measures to protect the integrity of transferred information from interception or duplication.\n\nThe default unencrypted MQTT port is 1883. The encrypted port is 8883.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mqtt.org/faq|title=FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} MQTT|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\n== MQTT broker ==\nA software running on a computer (running on-premises or in the cloud), could be self-built or hosted by a third party. Available as open source and proprietary with extra features added.\n\nThe broker acts as a post office, MQTT doesn\u2019t use the address of the intended recipient but uses the subject line called \u201cTopic\u201d, and anyone who wants a copy of that message will subscribe to that topic. \nMultiple clients can receive the message from a single broker (one to many capability). Similarly, multiple publishers can publish topics to a single subscriber (many to one).\n\nEach client can both produce and receive data by both publishing and subscribing, i.e. the devices can publish sensor data and still be able to receive the configuration information or control commands (MQTT is a bi-directional communication protocol). This helps in both sharing data, managing and controlling devices.\n\nWith MQTT broker architecture, the devices and application becomes decoupled and more secure. MQTT uses [[Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]] encryption with user name, password protected connections, and optional certifications that requires clients to provide a certificate file that matches with the server\u2019s. The clients are unaware of each others' IP address.\n\nIn case of a single source of failure, broker software and clients have an automatic handover to Redundant/automatic backup broker. The backup broker can also be setup to share the load of clients across multiple servers onsite, cloud, or the combination of both. \n\nThe broker can support both standard MQTT and MQTT for compliant specifications such as Sparkplug<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cirrus-link.com/mqtt-sparkplug-tahu/|title=MQTT Sparkplug/Tahu|website=www.cirrus-link.com|access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>, can be done with same server, same time and with same levels of security.\n\nThe broker can store the data in the form of retained messages (need to subscribe with database client) so that new subscribers to the topic can get the last value straight away.\n\nThe broker also keeps track of all the session\u2019s information as the devices goes on and off called \u201cpersistent sessions\u201d.\n\nThe main advantages of MQTT broker are:\n# Eliminates vulnerable and insecure client connections \n# Can easily scale from a single device to thousands\n# Manages and tracks all client connection states, including security credentials and certificates\n# Reduced network strain without compromising the security (cellular or satellite network)\n\n==Message types==\n=== Connect ===\n[[File:MQTT protocol example without QoS.svg|thumb|right|300px|Example of an MQTT connection (QoS 0) with connect, publish/subscribe, and disconnect. The first message from client B is stored due to the retain flag.]]\nWaits for a connection to be established with the server and creates a link between the nodes.\n\n=== Disconnect ===\nWaits for the MQTT client to finish any work it must do, and for the [[TCP/IP]] session to disconnect.\n\n=== Publish ===\nReturns immediately to the application thread after passing the request to the MQTT client.\n\n== Quality of service (QoS) ==\nEach connection to the broker can specify a ''[[quality of service]]'' measure.  These are classified in increasing order of overhead:\n* At most once - the message is sent only once and the client and broker take no additional steps to acknowledge delivery (fire and forget). \n* At least once - the message is re-tried by the sender multiple times until acknowledgement is received (acknowledged delivery).\n* Exactly once - the sender and receiver engage in a two-level handshake to ensure only one copy of the message is received (assured delivery). \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc62020_.htm|title=IBM Knowledge Center|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>\nThis field does not affect handling of the underlying TCP data transmissions; it is only used between MQTT senders and receivers.\n\n== Real-world applications ==\nThere are several projects that implement MQTT.

An MQTT broker is a server that receives all messages from the clients and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients.<ref name=\"message broker- client\">{{cite web |last1=Yuan |first1=Michael |title=Getting to know MQTT |url=https://developer.ibm.com/articles/iot-mqtt-why-good-for-iot/ |website=IBM Developer |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> An MQTT client is any device (from a micro controller up to a full-fledged server) that runs an MQTT library and connects to an MQTT broker over a network.<ref name=\"MQTT client - broker\">{{cite web |title=Client, Broker / Server and Connection Establishment - MQTT Essentials: Part 3 |url=https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-3-client-broker-connection-establishment/ |website=hivemq.com |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nInformation is organized in a hierarchy of '''topics'''.  When a publisher has a new item of data to distribute, it sends a control message with the data to the connected broker.  The broker then distributes the information to any clients that have subscribed to that topic. The publisher does not need to have any data on the number or locations of subscribers, and subscribers, in turn, do not have to be configured with any data about the publishers. \n\nIf a broker receives a message on a topic for which there are no current subscribers, the broker discards the message unless the publisher of the message designated the message as a '''retained message'''. A retained message is a normal MQTT message with the retained flag set to true. The broker stores the last retained message and the corresponding QoS for the selected topic. Each client that subscribes to a topic pattern that matches the topic of the retained message receives the retained message immediately after they subscribe. The broker stores only one retained message per topic.<ref name=\"MQTT retained messages\">{{cite web |title=Retained Messages - MQTT Essentials: Part 8 |url=https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/ |website=hivemq.com |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> This allows new subscribers to a topic to receive the most current value rather than waiting for the next update from a publisher. \n\nWhen a publishing client first connects to the broker, it can set up a default message to be sent to subscribers if the broker detects that the publishing client has unexpectedly disconnected from the broker. \n\nClients only interact with a broker, but a system may contain several broker servers that exchange data based on their current subscribers' topics. \n\nA minimal MQTT control message can be as little as two bytes of data.  A control message can carry nearly 256 megabytes of data if needed.  There are fourteen defined message types used to connect and disconnect a client from a broker, to publish data, to acknowledge receipt of data, and to supervise the connection between client and server. \n\nMQTT relies on the TCP protocol for data transmission. A variant, MQTT-SN, is used over other transports such as UDP or Bluetooth. \n\nMQTT sends connection credentials in plain text format and does not include any measures for security or authentication.  This can be provided by the underlying TCP transport using measures to protect the integrity of transferred information from interception or duplication.\n\nThe default unencrypted MQTT port is 1883. The encrypted port is 8883.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mqtt.org/faq|title=FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} MQTT|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\n== MQTT broker ==\nA software running on a computer (running on-premises or in the cloud), could be self-built or hosted by a third party. Available as open source and proprietary with extra features added.\n\nThe broker acts as a post office, MQTT doesn\u2019t use the address of the intended recipient but uses the subject line called \u201cTopic\u201d, and anyone who wants a copy of that message will subscribe to that topic. \nMultiple clients can receive the message from a single broker (one to many capability). Similarly, multiple publishers can publish topics to a single subscriber (many to one).\n\nEach client can both produce and receive data by both publishing and subscribing, i.e. the devices can publish sensor data and still be able to receive the configuration information or control commands (MQTT is a bi-directional communication protocol). This helps in both sharing data, managing and controlling devices.\n\nWith MQTT broker architecture, the devices and application becomes decoupled and more secure. MQTT uses [[Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]] encryption with user name, password protected connections, and optional certifications that requires clients to provide a certificate file that matches with the server\u2019s. The clients are unaware of each others' IP address.\n\nIn case of a single source of failure, broker software and clients have an automatic handover to Redundant/automatic backup broker. The backup broker can also be setup to share the load of clients across multiple servers onsite, cloud, or the combination of both. \n\nThe broker can support both standard MQTT and MQTT for compliant specifications such as Sparkplug<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cirrus-link.com/mqtt-sparkplug-tahu/|title=MQTT Sparkplug/Tahu|website=www.cirrus-link.com|access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>, can be done with same server, same time and with same levels of security.\n\nThe broker can store the data in the form of retained messages (need to subscribe with database client) so that new subscribers to the topic can get the last value straight away.\n\nThe broker also keeps track of all the session\u2019s information as the devices goes on and off called \u201cpersistent sessions\u201d.\n\nThe main advantages of MQTT broker are:\n# Eliminates vulnerable and insecure client connections \n# Can easily scale from a single device to thousands\n# Manages and tracks all client connection states, including security credentials and certificates\n# Reduced network strain without compromising the security (cellular or satellite network)\n\n==Message types==\n=== Connect ===\n[[File:MQTT protocol example without QoS.svg|thumb|right|300px|Example of an MQTT connection (QoS 0) with connect, publish/subscribe, and disconnect. The first message from client B is stored due to the retain flag.]]\nWaits for a connection to be established with the server and creates a link between the nodes.\n\n=== Disconnect ===\nWaits for the MQTT client to finish any work it must do, and for the [[TCP/IP]] session to disconnect.\n\n=== Publish ===\nReturns immediately to the application thread after passing the request to the MQTT client.\n\n== Quality of service (QoS) ==\nEach connection to the broker can specify a ''[[quality of service]]'' measure.  These are classified in increasing order of overhead:\n* At most once - the message is sent only once and the client and broker take no additional steps to acknowledge delivery (fire and forget). \n* At least once - the message is re-tried by the sender multiple times until acknowledgement is received (acknowledged delivery).\n* Exactly once - the sender and receiver engage in a two-level handshake to ensure only one copy of the message is received (assured delivery). \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc62020_.htm|title=IBM Knowledge Center|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>\nThis field does not affect handling of the underlying TCP data transmissions; it is only used between MQTT senders and receivers.\n\n== Real-world applications ==\nThere are several projects that implement MQTT.

Based upon [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'', it has also been known under the working titles ''The Decameron'', ''Angels and Virgins'', ''Guilty Pleasures'' and ''Chasing Temptation''. The film's Italian title ''Decameron Pie'' pays tribute to both the title of the original source inspiration and to American comedy film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. The film was released in France on December 12, 2007, under the title ''Medieval Pie'', and was released directly-to-DVD in the U.S. in August 2008. It was the last film produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in [[Florence]] ([[Republic of Florence]]) during the [[Black Death]]. As in the ''Decameron'', ten young [[Florence|Florentines]] take refuge from the plague. But instead of telling stories, they have lusty adventures, bawdy exchanges, romance and swordplay. There are randy nuns, [[Saracen]] pirates, and a sexy cow.\n\nPampinea is the daughter of a wealthy merchant who has died moments before the start of the movie. Lorenzo is a young man in town who is exceptionally good at gambling and is charmed by her beauty. Gerbino De Ratta is the head of the local thugs who robs anyone or steals anything that he sees stealable. Count Dzerzhinsky, from the city of [[Novgorod]] in [[Novgorod Republic]] now in modern [[Russia]], is Pampinea's fianc\u00e9 who she has never met. Their fate intertwines after Pampinea's father died and Gerbino robs Pampinea of her fortune, saying her father was in debt. The only way for the merchant's daughter to save her life was to marry him, according to Gerbino himself.\n\nLorenzo was being chased by Gerbino after he bested him at a gambling table, then took refuge in a convent by posing as a \"[[Deaf-mute|deaf and dumb]]\" gardener. At this convent, he has sex with all of the horny nuns, but only until Pampinea's arrival. Pampinea&mdash;trying to escape from Gerbino's grasp&mdash;ran to the convent for shelter. There she witnesses Lorenzo, whom she'd long had feelings for, having sex with the nuns and get jealous. She blindfolds Lorenzo and kisses him passionately out of love. But then, out of jealousy, she informs the convent's abbess of his deception, that he is actually neither deaf nor dumb.\n\nThe Count arrives in Florence only to be ambushed by Gerbino's men. All of his companions are killed, but he survives. Receiving a message from Pampinea's servant, Count Dzerzhinsky rides to Pampinea's father's mansion for the wedding, for he has been promised her hand in marriage. On the way, the young Count meets a [[skinny dipping]] Melissa&mdash;Pampinea's best friend, who is on her way to attend the wedding&mdash;and the two subsequently fall in love. The Count is led to believe Melissa is Pampinea.\n\nChased out of the convent, Lorenzo follows Pampinea to her father's mansion. There he confesses to her that he's fallen in love with the nun who kissed him whilst blindfolded, the woman whose face he never got to see. Later, Gerbino and his men arrive at the mansion and imprison Lorenzo. Pampinea agrees to marry Gerbino right that day to save Lorenzo, and thus Lorenzo is banished to the woods. There he meets Dzerzhinsky who is on his way to the mansion to be married to 'Pampinea' (actually Melissa) and the two team up to take out Gerbino's men.

Based upon [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'', it has also been known under the working titles ''The Decameron'', ''Angels and Virgins'', ''Guilty Pleasures'' and ''Chasing Temptation''. The film's Italian title ''Decameron Pie'' pays tribute to both the title of the original source inspiration and to American comedy film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. The film was released in France on December 12, 2007, under the title ''Medieval Pie'', and was released directly-to-DVD in the U.S. in August 2008. It was the last film produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in [[Florence]] ([[Republic of Florence]]) during the [[Black Death]]. As in the ''Decameron'', ten young [[Florence|Florentines]] take refuge from the plague. But instead of telling stories, they have lusty adventures, bawdy exchanges, romance and swordplay. There are randy nuns, [[Saracen]] pirates, and a sexy cow.\n\nPampinea is the daughter of a wealthy merchant who has died moments before the start of the movie. Lorenzo is a young man in town who is exceptionally good at gambling and is charmed by her beauty. Gerbino De Ratta is the head of the local thugs who robs anyone or steals anything that he sees stealable. Count Dzerzhinsky, from the city of [[Novgorod]] in [[Novgorod Republic]] now in modern [[Russia]], is Pampinea's fianc\u00e9 who she has never met. Their fate intertwines after Pampinea's father died and Gerbino robs Pampinea of her fortune, saying her father was in debt. The only way for the merchant's daughter to save her life was to marry him, according to Gerbino himself.\n\nLorenzo was being chased by Gerbino after he bested him at a gambling table, then took refuge in a convent by posing as a \"[[Deaf-mute|deaf and dumb]]\" gardener. At this convent, he has sex with all of the horny nuns, but only until Pampinea's arrival. Pampinea&mdash;trying to escape from Gerbino's grasp&mdash;ran to the convent for shelter. There she witnesses Lorenzo, whom she'd long had feelings for, having sex with the nuns and get jealous. She blindfolds Lorenzo and kisses him passionately out of love. But then, out of jealousy, she informs the convent's abbess of his deception, that he is actually neither deaf nor dumb.\n\nThe Count arrives in Florence only to be ambushed by Gerbino's men. All of his companions are killed, but he survives. Receiving a message from Pampinea's servant, Count Dzerzhinsky rides to Pampinea's father's mansion for the wedding, for he has been promised her hand in marriage. On the way, the young Count meets a [[skinny dipping]] Melissa&mdash;Pampinea's best friend, who is on her way to attend the wedding&mdash;and the two subsequently fall in love. The Count is led to believe Melissa is Pampinea.\n\nChased out of the convent, Lorenzo follows Pampinea to her father's mansion. There he confesses to her that he's fallen in love with the nun who kissed him whilst blindfolded, the woman whose face he never got to see. Later, Gerbino and his men arrive at the mansion and imprison Lorenzo. Pampinea agrees to marry Gerbino right that day to save Lorenzo, and thus Lorenzo is banished to the woods. There he meets Dzerzhinsky who is on his way to the mansion to be married to 'Pampinea' (actually Melissa) and the two team up to take out Gerbino's men. Gerbino himself dies falling into a large deep well inside the mansion.\n\nPampinea, in love with Lorenzo, refuses to get married to Count Dzerzhinsky, only to realise moments later that the Count himself is actually in love with Melissa who has been posing as her. She happily then runs after Lorenzo and kisses him. Lorenzo realises that she is in fact the nun he's in love with and they hold their wedding that very day, with all of their friends attending.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] - Lorenzo de Lamberti\n* [[Mischa Barton]] - Pampinea Anastargi\n* [[Tim Roth]] - Gerbino Della Ratta\n* [[Ryan Cartwright]] - Ghino\n* [[Rosalind Halstead]] - Filomena\n* [[Kate Groombridge]] - Melissa\n* [[Chris Egan (actor)|Christopher Egan]] - Dioneo\n* [[Nigel Planer]] - Uncle Bruno\n* [[Matthew Rhys]] - Count Dzerzhinsky\n* [[Rupert Friend]] - Alessandro Felice\n* [[Silvia Colloca]] - Sister Lisabetta\n* [[Anna Galiena]] - The Abbess\n* [[Elisabetta Canalis]] - Nun\n* [[Craig Parkinson]] - Tindaro\n\n==Soundtrack==\n*[[Wolfman and the Side-Effects]] \u2014 \"For Lovers\" (featuring [[Pete Doherty]])\n*[[Martina Topley-Bird]] \u2014 \"Bless You\"\n*[[Groove Armada]] \u2014 \"But I Feel Good\"\n*[[The Kills]] \u2014 \"No Wow (Telephone Radio Germany)\"\n*[[Basement Jaxx]] \u2014 \"Lucky Star\" (featuring [[Dizzee Rascal]])\n*[[Italian X-Rays (band)|Italian X-Rays]] \u2014 \"Art of Joy\"\n*[[Micah P.
