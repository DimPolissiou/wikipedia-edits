Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Modern Japanese street fashion==\nThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in [[Tokyo]] today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as [[Harajuku]] ([[Ura-Harajuku]]), [[Aoyama, Minato, Tokyo|Aoyama]], [[Ginza]], [[Odaiba]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].\n\n===Lolita===\n[[File:Kawaii Lolita \u00e0 Japan Expo 2014 (14506329019).jpg|alt=|thumb|Sweet Lolita]]\n{{Main|Lolita fashion}}\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\n* [[Gothic Lolita]] - is Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors, crosses, bats and spiders, as well as other popular gothic 'icons'. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n* [[Sweet Lolita]] - is the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the ''[[kawaii]]'' culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n*[[Classic Lolita]] - The theme of this sub-style is more closely resembled to the historical fashion back in Rococo or Victorian era. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n* [[Punk Lolita]] - An experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy, while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n*[[Kodona]], a.k.a. 'boy style' and ''ouji'', is a more masculine counterpart of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kodona|url=http://www.lolitafashion.org/kodona.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317165549/http://www.lolitafashion.org/kodona.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Gyaru'' ===\n[[File:Classic-gyaru-ikebukuro2009.jpg|thumb|Gyaru being photographed in [[Ikebukuro]] in 2009]]\n{{Main|Gyaru}}\nGyaru, which is sometimes known as ''[[ganguro]]'', which is actually a subcategory of gyaru, is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. Gyaru focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty (wigs, fake lashes, fake nails etc.). ''Gyaru'' is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\n===''Ganguro''===\n[[File:Glam crop.jpg|thumb|Two ''ganguro'' girls in Tokyo, April 2008]]\n{{Main|Ganguro}}\nThe ''ganguro'' style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. ''Ganguro'' falls into the larger subculture of ''[[gyaru]]'' fashion. ''Ganguro'' typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed [[sarong]]s. The ganguro style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces and platform shoes.\n\n===''Kogal''===\n[[File:Loosesocks-sobuline2011.jpg|right|thumb|A ''kogal'' identified by her [[loose socks]] and shortened skirt]]\n{{Main|Kogal}}\nThe kogal (''kogyaru'') look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, [[loose socks]], and often dyed hair and a scarf as well. The girls sometimes call themselves ''gyaru'' (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, but has since declined.\n\n===''B\u014ds\u014dzoku''===\n[[File:JapaneseBosozoku.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[cosplayer]]s dressed up in ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku''-style outfits]]\n{{Main|B\u014ds\u014dzoku}}\nWhile ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku'' fashion has not been popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku'' look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga and films. The typical b\u014ds\u014dzoku member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a [[jumpsuit]] like those worn by manual laborers or a tokko-fuku (\u7279\u653b\u670d), a type of military issued over-coat with [[kanji]] slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\n===Decora===\n\nThe Decora style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]], who rose to prominence in the [[Harajuku]] fashion scene prior to her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to color palettes for their decora; ex. Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie was often worn with short [[Tutu (clothing)|tutu]]-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tends to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of decora is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair are barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, armwarmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include [[leopard print]]s and patterned [[dental mask]]s. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\n===Kuroi Niji===\nKuroi Niji means \"Black Rainbow\" and the style is a mix between things from the general black scene and rainbow colors. It was introduced by Bou Osaki in 2012.\n\n===Visual kei===\n{{Main|Visual kei}}\n[[File:Versailles Chile.jpg|thumb|Visual kei band [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]]]\nVisual kei is a style created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western [[glam rock]] and [[glam metal]]. [[Androgyny]] is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include [[X Japan]], [[Luna Sea]], [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]], [[The Gazette (band)|The Gazette]], [[Mejibray]], [[Royz]], [[L'Arc en Ciel]], [[An Cafe]], [[Malice Mizer]], and [[Diaura]].\n\n====Oshare kei====\nOshare kei is a version of Visual kei and is seen as the most fashionable and cutting edge of the styles. The style focuses a lot on mixing different patterns, bright colors and punk elements to create a unique look. Unlike Visual kei, the make-up is toned down a bit and focuses more on the eyes alone. Facial piercings are also common. Just like Visual kei, Oshare kei has been largely influenced by musical artists. Some of those include [[An Cafe]], [[Panic Channel]], [[Ichigo69]], [[Lolita23q]], [[SuG]], [[Delacroix]], [[LM.C]], and [[Aicle]].\n\n====Angura kei====\nAngura kei is the darkest visual kei style. The clothes of the style tend to be mostly black, but with spikes and chains. Make-up is worn dark and heavy. The style has been compared to the modern [[Goth fashion|goth]].\nLike the other two styles mentioned, Angura kei is heavily influenced by underground music with the same name. Some of the most well-known ones include [[MUCC]], [[Floppy]], [[Guniw Tools]], [[Metronome]] and [[Nookicky]].\n\n====Cult party kei====\nCult party kei, named after the Harajuku shop Cult Party (now known as the Virgin Mary), is a relatively new coined style that is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace, satin bows and bible prints. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. In fact, Cult party kei is often worn with natural looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult party kei is considered by some to be a subset of dolly kei.\n\n====Dolly kei====\nDolly kei is a style based on Japan's view of the [[Middle Ages]] and European [[fairy tale]]s, especially the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. Grimoire is a store in Japan that has been described as 'the pioneering store behind the Dolly-kei fashion scene'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tokyofashion.com/grimoire-shibuya-japanese-dolly-kei-vintage-fashion-wonderland/ |title=Grimoire Shibuya - Japanese Dolly-kei & Vintage Fashion Wonderland |publisher=Tokyofashion.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n====Fairy kei====\nA childlike style, based on 1980s fashion. Outfits are made up of pastel colors (like lavender, baby blue, light pink, mint green, pale yellow, etc.), angel, toy and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as [[Polly Pocket]], [[My Little Pony]], [[Strawberry Shortcake]], [[Rainbow Brite]], [[Popples]], [[Lady Lovely Locks]], [[Barbie]], [[Wuzzles]], and [[Care Bears]]. Pastel colored hair is common although natural hair is also popular, hair is usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. The term fairy-kei originated from the magazine called Zipper (despite common belief that it was created by Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store Spank! which was the accidental creator of the style).<ref>{{cite web|last=McInnes|first=Paul|title=Spank! \u2013 Japanese \"80s Pop Disco\" Fashion in Tokyo|url=http://tokyofashion.com/spank-japanese-fashion-brand/|work=tokyofashion.com|publisher=tokyofashion.com|accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Mori Kei===\nMori (which means forest) fashion uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (cotton, linen, wool) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to dolly kei in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance, but in a more casual, earthy manner.<ref>{{cite news|last=SHOJI|first=KAORI|title=Cult of the Living Doll in Tokyo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/fashion/09iht-fdoll.html?_r=1|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Kimono style ===\n\nJapanese fashion is influenced by historic culture; we can now still see Japanese people wearing kimono on the street in Japan, especially in Ginza. In addition, they now still keep the culture of wearing kimono for special and important events, such as graduations, weddings, etc. The younger generation in Japan do also accept mixing kimono and modern style in fashion. They usually mix and match their own style to kimono, like wearing designers bags instead of traditional basket, wearing high heels instead of clogs. There are even modern designers having collections to be inspired, such as \"TANZEN\" from ISSEY MIYAKE.\n\n==Fashion industry and popular brands==\n[[File:Comme des Garcons at the Met (62473).jpg|thumb|Comme des Gar\u00e7ons garments on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. [[Issey Miyake]], [[Yohji Yamamoto]] and [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]] are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of [[monochrome]] color and cutting-edge design.\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, like Onitsuka Tiger (now known as the [[ASICS]]), but arguably it was not until the early 1990s that the industry saw a blooming emergence of street fashion brands.  The most popular Japanese brands include: [[A Bathing Ape]], [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]], [[Kenzo (brand)|Kenzo]], [[Evisu]], Head Porter, OriginalFake, [[Uniqlo]], [[Neighborhood Technical Apparel]], [[Visvim]], WTAPs, [[Jun Takahashi|Undercover]], [[mastermind Japan]], SOPHNET., uniform experiment, [[Number (N)ine]] and [[Hysteric Glamour]]. Street Fashion brands frequently feature collaborations with popular artists and designers and use limited edition as a selling strategy.  There are also brands that target specific fashion groups. For example, [[Angelic Pretty]] is for [[Lolita fashion|Lolita style]] and Sex Pot Revenge for [[Punk fashion|Punk style]].\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands.  According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's [[luxury goods]].<ref>[http://www.jetro.org/content/361 Japan External Trade Organization| Japan is the world's most concentrated source of revenue for luxury brands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302085725/http://www.jetro.org/content/361 |date=2009-03-02 }}</ref> The blue line of [[Burberry]] is among the most successful in this arena.\n\n==International influence==\nJapanese street fashion influences the [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>http://liftmeupwardrobe.co.uk/2013/07/19/fashion-sensei/</ref> High-end fashion brands like [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]] have played a big role in the global industry since the 80s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands.  In 2008, [[Rei Kawakubo]] designed for [[Louis Vuitton]]<ref>http://www.style.com/stylefile/2008/08/rei-kawakubo-puts-her-stamp-on-louis-vuitton/</ref> and [[H&M]].<ref>http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2008/04/03/comme-des-garcons-for-handm</ref>\n\n[[Tomoko Yamanaka]]'s work was featured at [[London Fashion Week]], 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/designer_profile.aspx?DesignerID=263 |title=Designer profile : Cabinet by Tomoko Yamanaka |publisher=London Fashion Week |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Social motives==\nThe motives driving the pursuit of fashion in Japan are complex. Firstly, the relatively large disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant. Many argue this was made possible through youth living at home with their parents, reducing living expenses.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/03/18/020318fa_FACT?currentPage=1 Letter from Tokyo: Shopping Rebellion \u2013 What the kids want]</ref> In addition, the emergence of a strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in the [[Harajuku]] district) drives much of the striving for new and different looks. The rise of consumerism to an important part of the \"national character\" of Japan during the economic boom of the 1980s, and even after the bubble burst consumerism also contributes to the pursuit of fashion. These factors result in swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Godoy|first1=Tiffany|editor1-last=Vartanian|editor1-first=Ivan|title=Style Deficit Disorder: Harajuku Street Fashion Tokyo|date=December 2007|publisher=Chronicle Books LLC|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=9780811857963|url=https://www.chroniclebooks.com/style-deficit-disorder-1.html|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<ul><li>[http://www.kingdom-visions.com/style-deficit-disorder-harajuku-street-fashion-tokyo-english.pdf PDF on kingdom-visions.com, readable on line with a free account]</li></ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[2000s in Japanese fashion]]\n* [[2010s in Asian fashion]]\n* [[Youth culture]]\n* [[Fruits (magazine)]]\n* [[Kawaii|Cuteness in Japanese culture]]\n*[[Aristocrat (fashion)|Madam/Aristocrat]]\n*[[Elegant Gothic Aristocrat]]\n*[[Neo-Victorian]]\n*[[Cosplay]]\n*[[Visual Kei]]\n*[[Poupee Girl]]\n*[[Baby the stars shine bright]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.kigurumies.com/ Kigurumi]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180828024826/https://urbntokyo.com/ Japanese Urban Fashion]\n*[http://amazonfashionweektokyo.com/ Japan Fashion Week in Tokyo]\n*[http://www.kobe-collection.com/ Kobe Collection]\n*[http://girlswalker.com/tgc/ Tokyo Girls Collection]\n*[http://tokyofashion.com/ Tokyo fashion.com]\n*[http://www.style-arena.jp/ Style arena]\n*[https://www.fashion-press.net/ Fashion Press]\n\n{{Fashion weeks}}\n{{Japanese subcultures}}\n{{Fashion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Japanese Street Fashion}}\n[[Category:Japanese subcultures]]\n[[Category:Japanese fashion| ]]\n[[Category:Street fashion]]\n", "text_old": "There are many styles of '''[[street fashion]] in [[Japan]]''', created from a mix of both local and foreign labels.

Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as [[Harajuku]] ([[Ura-Harajuku]]), [[Aoyama, Minato, Tokyo|Aoyama]], [[Ginza]], [[Odaiba]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].\n\n===Lolita===\n[[File:Kawaii Lolita \u00e0 Japan Expo 2014 (14506329019).jpg|alt=|thumb|Sweet Lolita]]\n{{Main|Lolita fashion}}\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\n* [[Gothic Lolita]] - is Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors, crosses, bats and spiders, as well as other popular gothic 'icons'. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n* [[Sweet Lolita]] - is the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the ''[[kawaii]]'' culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n*[[Classic Lolita]] - The theme of this sub-style is more closely resembled to the historical fashion back in Rococo or Victorian era. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n* [[Punk Lolita]] - An experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy, while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n*[[Kodona]], a.k.a. 'boy style' and ''ouji'', is a more masculine counterpart of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kodona|url=http://www.lolitafashion.org/kodona.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317165549/http://www.lolitafashion.org/kodona.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Gyaru'' ===\n[[File:Classic-gyaru-ikebukuro2009.jpg|thumb|Gyaru being photographed in [[Ikebukuro]] in 2009]]\n{{Main|Gyaru}}\nGyaru, which is sometimes known as ''[[ganguro]]'', which is actually a subcategory of gyaru, is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. Gyaru focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty (wigs, fake lashes, fake nails etc.). ''Gyaru'' is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\n===''Ganguro''===\n[[File:Glam crop.jpg|thumb|Two ''ganguro'' girls in Tokyo, April 2008]]\n{{Main|Ganguro}}\nThe ''ganguro'' style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. ''Ganguro'' falls into the larger subculture of ''[[gyaru]]'' fashion. ''Ganguro'' typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed [[sarong]]s. The ganguro style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces and platform shoes.\n\n===''Kogal''===\n[[File:Loosesocks-sobuline2011.jpg|right|thumb|A ''kogal'' identified by her [[loose socks]] and shortened skirt]]\n{{Main|Kogal}}\nThe kogal (''kogyaru'') look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, [[loose socks]], and often dyed hair and a scarf as well. The girls sometimes call themselves ''gyaru'' (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, but has since declined.\n\n===''B\u014ds\u014dzoku''===\n[[File:JapaneseBosozoku.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[cosplayer]]s dressed up in ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku''-style outfits]]\n{{Main|B\u014ds\u014dzoku}}\nWhile ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku'' fashion has not been popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical ''b\u014ds\u014dzoku'' look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga and films. The typical b\u014ds\u014dzoku member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a [[jumpsuit]] like those worn by manual laborers or a tokko-fuku (\u7279\u653b\u670d), a type of military issued over-coat with [[kanji]] slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\n===Decora===\n\nThe Decora style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]], who rose to prominence in the [[Harajuku]] fashion scene prior to her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to color palettes for their decora; ex. Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie was often worn with short [[Tutu (clothing)|tutu]]-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tends to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of decora is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair are barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, armwarmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include [[leopard print]]s and patterned [[dental mask]]s. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\n===Kuroi Niji===\nKuroi Niji means \"Black Rainbow\" and the style is a mix between things from the general black scene and rainbow colors. It was introduced by Bou Osaki in 2012.\n\n===Visual kei===\n{{Main|Visual kei}}\n[[File:Versailles Chile.jpg|thumb|Visual kei band [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]]]\nVisual kei is a style created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western [[glam rock]] and [[glam metal]]. [[Androgyny]] is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include [[X Japan]], [[Luna Sea]], [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]], [[The Gazette (band)|The Gazette]], [[Mejibray]], [[Royz]], [[L'Arc en Ciel]], [[An Cafe]], [[Malice Mizer]], and [[Diaura]].\n\n====Oshare kei====\nOshare kei is a version of Visual kei and is seen as the most fashionable and cutting edge of the styles. The style focuses a lot on mixing different patterns, bright colors and punk elements to create a unique look. Unlike Visual kei, the make-up is toned down a bit and focuses more on the eyes alone. Facial piercings are also common. Just like Visual kei, Oshare kei has been largely influenced by musical artists. Some of those include [[An Cafe]], [[Panic Channel]], [[Ichigo69]], [[Lolita23q]], [[SuG]], [[Delacroix]], [[LM.C]], and [[Aicle]].\n\n====Angura kei====\nAngura kei is the darkest visual kei style. The clothes of the style tend to be mostly black, but with spikes and chains. Make-up is worn dark and heavy. The style has been compared to the modern [[Goth fashion|goth]].\nLike the other two styles mentioned, Angura kei is heavily influenced by underground music with the same name. Some of the most well-known ones include [[MUCC]], [[Floppy]], [[Guniw Tools]], [[Metronome]] and [[Nookicky]].\n\n====Cult party kei====\nCult party kei, named after the Harajuku shop Cult Party (now known as the Virgin Mary), is a relatively new coined style that is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace, satin bows and bible prints. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. In fact, Cult party kei is often worn with natural looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult party kei is considered by some to be a subset of dolly kei.\n\n====Dolly kei====\nDolly kei is a style based on Japan's view of the [[Middle Ages]] and European [[fairy tale]]s, especially the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. Grimoire is a store in Japan that has been described as 'the pioneering store behind the Dolly-kei fashion scene'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tokyofashion.com/grimoire-shibuya-japanese-dolly-kei-vintage-fashion-wonderland/ |title=Grimoire Shibuya - Japanese Dolly-kei & Vintage Fashion Wonderland |publisher=Tokyofashion.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n====Fairy kei====\nA childlike style, based on 1980s fashion. Outfits are made up of pastel colors (like lavender, baby blue, light pink, mint green, pale yellow, etc.), angel, toy and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as [[Polly Pocket]], [[My Little Pony]], [[Strawberry Shortcake]], [[Rainbow Brite]], [[Popples]], [[Lady Lovely Locks]], [[Barbie]], [[Wuzzles]], and [[Care Bears]]. Pastel colored hair is common although natural hair is also popular, hair is usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. The term fairy-kei originated from the magazine called Zipper (despite common belief that it was created by Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store Spank! which was the accidental creator of the style).<ref>{{cite web|last=McInnes|first=Paul|title=Spank! \u2013 Japanese \"80s Pop Disco\" Fashion in Tokyo|url=http://tokyofashion.com/spank-japanese-fashion-brand/|work=tokyofashion.com|publisher=tokyofashion.com|accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Mori Kei===\nMori (which means forest) fashion uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (cotton, linen, wool) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to dolly kei in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance, but in a more casual, earthy manner.<ref>{{cite news|last=SHOJI|first=KAORI|title=Cult of the Living Doll in Tokyo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/fashion/09iht-fdoll.html?_r=1|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Kimono style ===\n\nJapanese fashion is influenced by historic culture; we can now still see Japanese people wearing kimono on the street in Japan, especially in Ginza. In addition, they now still keep the culture of wearing kimono for special and important events, such as graduations, weddings, etc. The younger generation in Japan do also accept mixing kimono and modern style in fashion. They usually mix and match their own style to kimono, like wearing designers bags instead of traditional basket, wearing high heels instead of clogs. There are even modern designers having collections to be inspired, such as \"TANZEN\" from ISSEY MIYAKE.\n\n==Fashion industry and popular brands==\n[[File:Comme des Garcons at the Met (62473).jpg|thumb|Comme des Gar\u00e7ons garments on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. [[Issey Miyake]], [[Yohji Yamamoto]] and [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]] are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of [[monochrome]] color and cutting-edge design.\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, like Onitsuka Tiger (now known as the [[ASICS]]), but arguably it was not until the early 1990s that the industry saw a blooming emergence of street fashion brands.  The most popular Japanese brands include: [[A Bathing Ape]], [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]], [[Kenzo (brand)|Kenzo]], [[Evisu]], Head Porter, OriginalFake, [[Uniqlo]], [[Neighborhood Technical Apparel]], [[Visvim]], WTAPs, [[Jun Takahashi|Undercover]], [[mastermind Japan]], SOPHNET., uniform experiment, [[Number (N)ine]] and [[Hysteric Glamour]]. Street Fashion brands frequently feature collaborations with popular artists and designers and use limited edition as a selling strategy.  There are also brands that target specific fashion groups. For example, [[Angelic Pretty]] is for [[Lolita fashion|Lolita style]] and Sex Pot Revenge for [[Punk fashion|Punk style]].\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands.  According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's [[luxury goods]].<ref>[http://www.jetro.org/content/361 Japan External Trade Organization| Japan is the world's most concentrated source of revenue for luxury brands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302085725/http://www.jetro.org/content/361 |date=2009-03-02 }}</ref> The blue line of [[Burberry]] is among the most successful in this arena.\n\n==International influence==\nJapanese street fashion influences the [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>http://liftmeupwardrobe.co.uk/2013/07/19/fashion-sensei/</ref> High-end fashion brands like [[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]] have played a big role in the global industry since the 80s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands.  In 2008, [[Rei Kawakubo]] designed for [[Louis Vuitton]]<ref>http://www.style.com/stylefile/2008/08/rei-kawakubo-puts-her-stamp-on-louis-vuitton/</ref> and [[H&M]].<ref>http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2008/04/03/comme-des-garcons-for-handm</ref>\n\n[[Tomoko Yamanaka]]'s work was featured at [[London Fashion Week]], 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/designer_profile.aspx?DesignerID=263 |title=Designer profile : Cabinet by Tomoko Yamanaka |publisher=London Fashion Week |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Social motives==\nThe motives driving the pursuit of fashion in Japan are complex. Firstly, the relatively large disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant. Many argue this was made possible through youth living at home with their parents, reducing living expenses.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/03/18/020318fa_FACT?currentPage=1 Letter from Tokyo: Shopping Rebellion \u2013 What the kids want]</ref> In addition, the emergence of a strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in the [[Harajuku]] district) drives much of the striving for new and different looks. The rise of consumerism to an important part of the \"national character\" of Japan during the economic boom of the 1980s, and even after the bubble burst consumerism also contributes to the pursuit of fashion. These factors result in swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Godoy|first1=Tiffany|editor1-last=Vartanian|editor1-first=Ivan|title=Style Deficit Disorder: Harajuku Street Fashion Tokyo|date=December 2007|publisher=Chronicle Books LLC|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=9780811857963|url=https://www.chroniclebooks.com/style-deficit-disorder-1.html|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<ul><li>[http://www.kingdom-visions.com/style-deficit-disorder-harajuku-street-fashion-tokyo-english.pdf PDF on kingdom-visions.com, readable on line with a free account]</li></ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[2000s in Japanese fashion]]\n* [[2010s in Asian fashion]]\n* [[Youth culture]]\n* [[Fruits (magazine)]]\n* [[Kawaii|Cuteness in Japanese culture]]\n*[[Aristocrat (fashion)|Madam/Aristocrat]]\n*[[Elegant Gothic Aristocrat]]\n*[[Neo-Victorian]]\n*[[Cosplay]]\n*[[Visual Kei]]\n*[[Poupee Girl]]\n*[[Ikeda Jeans]]\n*[[Baby the stars shine bright]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.kigurumies.com/ Kigurumi]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180828024826/https://urbntokyo.com/ Japanese Urban Fashion]\n*[http://amazonfashionweektokyo.com/ Japan Fashion Week in Tokyo]\n*[http://www.kobe-collection.com/ Kobe Collection]\n*[http://girlswalker.com/tgc/ Tokyo Girls Collection]\n*[http://tokyofashion.com/ Tokyo fashion.com]\n*[http://www.style-arena.jp/ Style arena]\n*[https://www.fashion-press.net/ Fashion Press]\n\n{{Fashion weeks}}\n{{Japanese subcultures}}\n{{Fashion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Japanese Street Fashion}}\n[[Category:Japanese subcultures]]\n[[Category:Japanese fashion| ]]\n[[Category:Street fashion]]\n", "name_user": "PorcSharpQuills", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:non-existing article, red link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_street_fashion"}

He had met Stavianicek in 1950, the year of his mother's death and one year after the death of his beloved grandfather. Stavianicek was the major support in Bernhard's life and greatly furthered his literary career. The extent or nature of his relationships with women is obscure.

Nevertheless, while reviled by some Austrians for his outspoken and harsh views of his homeland, including its Nazi past,<ref name=\":1\" />  he was, during his lifetime, also highly acclaimed in Austria, winning a number of major awards, and was seen by many as the pre-eminent writer of the time.\n\nHis work is most influenced by the feeling of being abandoned (in his childhood and youth) and by his incurable illness, which caused him to see death as the ultimate essence of existence. His work typically features loners' [[monologue]]s explaining, to a rather silent listener, his views on the state of the world, often with reference to a concrete situation. This is true for his plays as well as for his prose, where the monologues are then reported ''second hand'' by the listener. Alongside his serious and pessimistic views, his works also contain some very funny observations on life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bernhard is often considered a verbose writer, but [[Andreas Dorschel]] has broadened this view by showing that Bernhard's characters (specifically in ''Das Kalkwerk'') oscillate between excessive speech and highly economical expressions. As Dorschel argues, the two modes produce a series of oppositions with mutually informing sides.<ref>Andreas Dorschel, \u2018Lakonik und Suada in der Prosa Thomas Bernhards\u2019, ''Thomas Bernhard Jahrbuch'' 2007/08, pp. 215\u2013233; cf. Simon Walsh in ''Modern Austrian Literature'' 43 (2010), issue 4, p. 100</ref>\n\nBernhard's main protagonists, often scholars or, as he calls them, ''Geistesmenschen'' (intellectuals), denounce everything that matters to the Austrian in [[contumacy]]-filled tirades against a \"stupid populace\". He also attacks the state (often called \"Catholic-National-Socialist\"), generally respected institutions such as Vienna's [[Burgtheater]], and much-loved artists. His work also continually deals with the isolation and self-destruction of people striving for an unreachable perfection, since this same perfection would mean stagnancy and therefore death. [[Anti-Catholic]] rhetoric is not uncommon.\n\n\"Es ist alles l\u00e4cherlich, wenn man an den Tod denkt\" (Everything is ridiculous, when one thinks of Death) was his comment when he received a minor Austrian national award in 1968, which resulted in one of the many public scandals he caused over the years and which became part of his fame. His novel ''Holzf\u00e4llen'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]), for instance, could not be published for years due to a defamation [[Cause of action|claim]] by a former friend. Many of his plays\u2014above all ''Heldenplatz'' ([[1988 in literature|1988]])\u2014were met with criticism from many Austrians, who claimed they sullied Austria's reputation. One of the more controversial lines called Austria \"a brutal and stupid nation ... a mindless, cultureless sewer which spreads its penetrating stench all over Europe.\" ''Heldenplatz'', as well as the other plays Bernhard wrote in these years, were staged at Vienna's famous Burgtheater by the controversial director {{ill|Claus Peymann|de}}.\n\nEven in death Bernhard caused disturbance by his, as he supposedly called it, ''[[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]] literary [[emigration]]'', by disallowing all publication and stagings of his work within Austria's borders. The International Thomas Bernhard Foundation, established by his executor and half-brother Dr. Peter Fabjan, has since made exceptions, although the German firm of Suhrkamp remains his principal publisher.\n\nThe correspondence between Bernhard and his publisher Siegfried Unseld from 1961 to 1989 \u2013 about 500 letters \u2013 was published in December 2009 at [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], Germany.<ref>[http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html ''Der Briefwechsel Thomas Bernhard/Siegfried Unseld''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206130610/http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html |date=2009-12-06 }}, [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], 2009-12-07</ref>\n\n== Works (in translation) ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Frost (novel)|Frost]]'' (1963), translated by [[Michael Hofmann]] (2006)\n* ''[[Gargoyles (novel)|Gargoyles]]'' (''Verst\u00f6rung'', 1967), translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston]] (1970)\n* ''[[The Lime Works]]'' (''Das Kalkwerk'', 1970), translated by [[Sophie Wilkins]] (1973)\n* ''[[Correction (novel)|Correction]]'' (''Korrektur'', 1975), translated by Sophie Wilkins (1979)\n* ''[[Yes (novel)|Yes]]'' (''Ja'', 1978), translated by [[Ewald Osers]] (1991)\n* ''The Cheap-Eaters'' (''Die Billigesser'', 1980), translated by [[Ewald Osers]] (1990)\n* ''[[Concrete (novel)|Concrete]]'' (''Beton'', 1982), translated by [[David McLintock]] (1984)\n* ''[[Wittgenstein's Nephew]]'' (''Wittgensteins Neffe'', 1982), translated by David McLintock (1988)\n* ''[[The Loser]]'' (''Der Untergeher'', 1983), translated by Jack Dawson (1991)\n* ''[[Woodcutters]]'' (''Holzf\u00e4llen: Eine Erregung'', 1984), translated by Ewald Osers (1985), and by David McLintock (1988)\n* ''[[Old Masters (novel)|Old Masters: A Comedy]]'' (''Alte Meister.

Nevertheless, while reviled by some Austrians for his outspoken and harsh views of his homeland, including its Nazi past,<ref name=\":1\" />  he was, during his lifetime, also highly acclaimed in Austria, winning a number of major awards, and was seen by many as the pre-eminent writer of the time.\n\nHis work is most influenced by the feeling of being abandoned (in his childhood and youth) and by his incurable illness, which caused him to see death as the ultimate essence of existence. His work typically features loners' [[monologue]]s explaining, to a rather silent listener, his views on the state of the world, often with reference to a concrete situation. This is true for his plays as well as for his prose, where the monologues are then reported ''second hand'' by the listener. Alongside his serious and pessimistic views, his works also contain some very funny observations on life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bernhard is often considered a verbose writer, but [[Andreas Dorschel]] has broadened this view by showing that Bernhard's characters (specifically in ''Das Kalkwerk'') oscillate between excessive speech and highly economical expressions. As Dorschel argues, the two modes produce a series of oppositions with mutually informing sides.<ref>Andreas Dorschel, \u2018Lakonik und Suada in der Prosa Thomas Bernhards\u2019, ''Thomas Bernhard Jahrbuch'' 2007/08, pp. 215\u2013233; cf. Simon Walsh in ''Modern Austrian Literature'' 43 (2010), issue 4, p. 100</ref>\n\nBernhard's main protagonists, often scholars or, as he calls them, ''Geistesmenschen'' (intellectuals), denounce everything that matters to the Austrian in [[contumacy]]-filled tirades against a \"stupid populace\". He also attacks the state (often called \"Catholic-National-Socialist\"), generally respected institutions such as Vienna's [[Burgtheater]], and much-loved artists. His work also continually deals with the isolation and self-destruction of people striving for an unreachable perfection, since this same perfection would mean stagnancy and therefore death. [[Anti-Catholic]] rhetoric is not uncommon.\n\n\"Es ist alles l\u00e4cherlich, wenn man an den Tod denkt\" (Everything is ridiculous, when one thinks of Death) was his comment when he received a minor Austrian national award in 1968, which resulted in one of the many public scandals he caused over the years and which became part of his fame. His novel ''Holzf\u00e4llen'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]), for instance, could not be published for years due to a defamation [[Cause of action|claim]] by a former friend. Many of his plays\u2014above all ''Heldenplatz'' ([[1988 in literature|1988]])\u2014were met with criticism from many Austrians, who claimed they sullied Austria's reputation. One of the more controversial lines called Austria \"a brutal and stupid nation ... a mindless, cultureless sewer which spreads its penetrating stench all over Europe.\" ''Heldenplatz'', as well as the other plays Bernhard wrote in these years, were staged at Vienna's famous Burgtheater by the controversial director {{ill|Claus Peymann|de}}.\n\nEven in death Bernhard caused disturbance by his, as he supposedly called it, ''[[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]] literary [[emigration]]'', by disallowing all publication and stagings of his work within Austria's borders. The International Thomas Bernhard Foundation, established by his executor and half-brother Dr. Peter Fabjan, has since made exceptions, although the German firm of Suhrkamp remains his principal publisher.\n\nThe correspondence between Bernhard and his publisher Siegfried Unseld from 1961 to 1989 \u2013 about 500 letters \u2013 was published in December 2009 at [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], Germany.<ref>[http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html ''Der Briefwechsel Thomas Bernhard/Siegfried Unseld''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206130610/http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html |date=2009-12-06 }}, [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], 2009-12-07</ref>\n\n== Works (in translation) ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Frost (novel)|Frost]]'' (1963), translated by [[Michael Hofmann]] (2006)\n* ''[[Gargoyles (novel)|Gargoyles]]'' (''Verst\u00f6rung'', 1967), translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston]] (1970)\n* ''[[The Lime Works]]'' (''Das Kalkwerk'', 1970), translated by [[Sophie Wilkins]] (1973)\n* ''[[Correction (novel)|Correction]]'' (''Korrektur'', 1975), translated by Sophie Wilkins (1979)\n* ''[[Yes (novel)|Yes]]'' (''Ja'', 1978), translated by [[Ewald Osers]] (1991)\n* ''The Cheap-Eaters'' (''Die Billigesser'', 1980), translated by [[Ewald Osers]] (1990)\n* ''[[Concrete (novel)|Concrete]]'' (''Beton'', 1982), translated by [[David McLintock]] (1984)\n* ''[[Wittgenstein's Nephew]]'' (''Wittgensteins Neffe'', 1982), translated by David McLintock (1988)\n* ''[[The Loser]]'' (''Der Untergeher'', 1983), translated by Jack Dawson (1991)\n* ''[[Woodcutters]]'' (''Holzf\u00e4llen: Eine Erregung'', 1984), translated by Ewald Osers (1985), and by David McLintock (1988)\n* ''[[Old Masters (novel)|Old Masters: A Comedy]]'' (''Alte Meister.

Some of these are a revival of  1990s hip-hop fashion, which also favoured bomber jackets and baseball caps.\n\nContemporary streetwear is usually influenced by the generic sporty twists and sleek athletic lines. In earlier stages of sportswear fashion, femininity was usually expressed with the lines becoming cleaner, and silhouettes becoming minimal. Later, bold volumes in sportswear started to develop, [[High tech|hi-tech]] fabrics and old-school approaches were used in styling. In general, relaxed silhouettes, clean shapes, little embellishments, and an overall sophisticated feel would be observed in the looks of the trend.\n\nContemporary streetwear has also become much more influential in the world of haute couture influencing and in turn being influenced by runway shows by prominent designers.

High-end and luxury brands began to develop \"luxury sportswear\", for example [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], Gucci, and [[DKNY]]. Among this type of \"luxury sportswear\", luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like [[silk]] organza, washed [[satin]], [[leather]], [[neoprene]], and [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|wool crepe]] were used to produce the \"luxury sportswear\". These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season.\n\nDetails of the designs in \"luxury sportswear\" looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, \"luxury\" and \"minimalism\" were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences.\n\nCommon mix-and-match combination of \"luxury sportswear\" on streetwear are track pants under [[basketball shorts]], with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; and light colored [[pencil skirt]]s, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, cut in satin or tweed, for women.\n\n=== Seasonal sportswear ===\nSportswear in streetwear designs changes according to season and temperature.\n\nIn winter, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier and volumes are exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as [[fur]], [[velvet]], [[wool]] and leather become predominant, and quilted detailing on [[windbreaker]]s, sporty skirts and vests can be seen. A typical winter look might be a voluminous sweatshirt with satin [[boxer shorts]], or a brocade bomber jacket worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing.\n\nIn summer, the look is usually light-weight and simple, with a combination of [[crop top]]s, sleek dresses, [[Gym shorts|gym-shorts,]] and tank-tops.\n\n=== Hypebeast culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2019}}\nHypebeast (occasionally \"hype beast\") culture is a colloquial term that at first was considered a derogatory term until Kevin Ma coined it for his fashion blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1623507/streetwears-impact-on-fashion-goes-beyond-hoodies-and-t-shirts/|title=Streetwear is what happens to fashion when consumers start dictating the terms|last=Bain|first=Marc|website=Quartzy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even after Ma\u2019s fashion blog expanded to a world-famous website, hypebeast still had a negative connotation behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registerforum.org/3437/news/hypebeast-culture/|title=Hypebeast Culture|last=Weissburg|first=Josie|website=The Register Forum|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even though many hypebeasts will refer to themselves as such, taking it as a term of endearment (much like the evolution of the term [[otaku]] in Japanese popular culture circles) others still believe in the negative connotation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2013/08/evolution-of-the-hypebeast/|title=The Evolution of the Hypebeast: An Illustrated Guide|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nWith a growing trend of prominent brand names and logos on clothing, there has been a development of \"hypebeast culture\" connected to streetwear as of the mid-2000s.

Some of these are a revival of  1990s hip-hop fashion, which also favoured bomber jackets and baseball caps.\n\nContemporary streetwear is usually influenced by the generic sporty twists and sleek athletic lines. In earlier stages of sportswear fashion, femininity was usually expressed with the lines becoming cleaner, and silhouettes becoming minimal. Later, bold volumes in sportswear started to develop, [[High tech|hi-tech]] fabrics and old-school approaches were used in styling. In general, relaxed silhouettes, clean shapes, little embellishments, and an overall sophisticated feel would be observed in the looks of the trend.\n\nContemporary streetwear has also become much more influential in the world of haute couture influencing and in turn being influenced by runway shows by prominent designers. [[Raf Simons]] has made a large impact on streetwear stylings as it has evolved over the years, this might be attributed by the designers influence in hip hop and popular culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nssmag.com/en/fashion/11481/raf-simons|title=Why is streetwear obsessed with Raf Simons?|work=nss magazine|date=June 1, 2017|first=Valerio|last=Coretti}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLryuBCO-M</ref> Other designers such as Demna Gvasalia, creative director of [[Vetements]] and [[Balenciaga]], have also had an impact in recent years championing trends such as the chunky sneaker<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/style/sneakers-balenciaga-triple-s.html|first=Jon|last=Caramanica|date=July 25, 2018|title=My 8-Month Search for $900 Sneakers|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> and the oversized hoodie,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2016/3/2/11139622/what-is-vetements|title=What Is Vetements and Why Is Everyone Freaking Out?|first=Nicola|last=Fumo|date=March 2, 2016|work=[[Racked]]}}</ref> which have slowly become streetwear staples.\n\n=== Luxury sportswear ===\n[[File:Alexander Wang Photo by Ed Kavishe Fashion Wire Press.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] developed \"luxury sportswear\" in his eponymous brand]]\nThe decline of [[formal wear]] led to the rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands began to develop \"luxury sportswear\", for example [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], Gucci, and [[DKNY]]. Among this type of \"luxury sportswear\", luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like [[silk]] organza, washed [[satin]], [[leather]], [[neoprene]], and [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|wool crepe]] were used to produce the \"luxury sportswear\". These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season.\n\nDetails of the designs in \"luxury sportswear\" looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, \"luxury\" and \"minimalism\" were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences.\n\nCommon mix-and-match combination of \"luxury sportswear\" on streetwear are track pants under [[basketball shorts]], with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; and light colored [[pencil skirt]]s, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, cut in satin or tweed, for women.\n\n=== Seasonal sportswear ===\nSportswear in streetwear designs changes according to season and temperature.\n\nIn winter, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier and volumes are exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as [[fur]], [[velvet]], [[wool]] and leather become predominant, and quilted detailing on [[windbreaker]]s, sporty skirts and vests can be seen. A typical winter look might be a voluminous sweatshirt with satin [[boxer shorts]], or a brocade bomber jacket worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing.\n\nIn summer, the look is usually light-weight and simple, with a combination of [[crop top]]s, sleek dresses, [[Gym shorts|gym-shorts,]] and tank-tops.\n\n=== Hypebeast culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2019}}\nHypebeast (occasionally \"hype beast\") culture is a colloquial term that at first was considered a derogatory term until Kevin Ma coined it for his fashion blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1623507/streetwears-impact-on-fashion-goes-beyond-hoodies-and-t-shirts/|title=Streetwear is what happens to fashion when consumers start dictating the terms|last=Bain|first=Marc|website=Quartzy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even after Ma\u2019s fashion blog expanded to a world-famous website, hypebeast still had a negative connotation behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registerforum.org/3437/news/hypebeast-culture/|title=Hypebeast Culture|last=Weissburg|first=Josie|website=The Register Forum|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Even though many hypebeasts will refer to themselves as such, taking it as a term of endearment (much like the evolution of the term [[otaku]] in Japanese popular culture circles) others still believe in the negative connotation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2013/08/evolution-of-the-hypebeast/|title=The Evolution of the Hypebeast: An Illustrated Guide|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nWith a growing trend of prominent brand names and logos on clothing, there has been a development of \"hypebeast culture\" connected to streetwear as of the mid-2000s.
