[[John Bennet Lawes]], an English [[entrepreneur]], began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field. One immediate consequence was that in 1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulfuric acid, and thus was the first to create the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]], with whom he carried on for more than half a century on experiments in raising crops at the [[Rothamsted Research|Institute of Arable Crops Research]].<ref>{{EB1911|wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Birkeland\u2013Eyde process]] was one of the competing industrial processes in the beginning of nitrogen based fertilizer production.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The development of modern chemistry\n| author = Aaron John Ihde\n| publisher = Courier Dover Publications\n| year = 1984\n| isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2\n| page = 678\n}}</ref> This process was used to fix atmospheric [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) into [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as [[nitrogen fixation]].

They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Reuse of urine demonstration - fertilised and not fertilised tomato plant experiment (3617543234).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Six tomato plants grown with and without nitrate fertilizer on nutrient-poor sand/clay soil. One of the plants in the nutrient-poor soil has died.]]\nFertilizers  enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients.  The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration.  This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect.\nFertilizers typically provide, in varying [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]]:<ref name=Ull/>\n* three main macronutrients:\n** [[Nitrogen]] (N): leaf growth\n** [[Phosphorus]] (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;\n** [[Potassium]] (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting;\n* three secondary macronutrients: [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S);\n* micronutrients: [[copper]] (Cu), [[Iron fertilisation|iron]] (Fe), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[boron]] (B). Of occasional significance are [[silicon]] (Si), [[cobalt]] (Co), and [[vanadium]] (V).\n\nThe nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers.  Instead [[chemical compound|compounds]] containing these elements are the basis of fertilizers.  The macro-nutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a [[dry matter]] (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.  Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and other components (e.g., [[chlorophyll]]).  To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a \"fixed\" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably [[legume]]s) can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) by converting it to [[ammonia]].  Phosphate is required for the production of DNA and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids.\n\nMicronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of [[Parts-per notation|parts-per-million]] (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm or less than 0.04% dry matter.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aesl.ces.uga.edu/publications/plant/Nutrient.asp|title = AESL Plant Analysis Handbook&nbsp;\u2013 Nutrient Content of Plant|publisher = Aesl.ces.uga.edu|date = |access-date = 11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills and Jones, 1996\">{{cite book|author1=H.A.

Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.\n\n==Classification==\nFertilizers are classified in several ways.  They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as \"straight fertilizers.\"  \"Multinutrient fertilizers\" (or \"complex fertilizers\") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P.  Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic.  Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except [[ureas]].  Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter.  Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.<ref>J.

[[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is also widely used. [[Urea]] is another popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage that it is solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate, respectively.

[[Triple superphosphate]] (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.\n\nThe main potassium-based straight fertilizer is Muriate of Potash (MOP).  Muriate of Potash consists of 95-99% KCl, and is typically available as 0-0-60 or 0-0-62 fertilizer.\n\n===Multinutrient fertilizers===\nThese fertilizers are common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.\n\n====Binary (NP, NK, PK) fertilizers====\nMajor two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are [[monoammonium phosphate]] (MAP) and [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.\n\n====NPK fertilizers====\n{{Main|Labeling of fertilizer}}\nNPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n[[NPK rating]] is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Summary of State Fertilizer Laws |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/dec03/121503/02N-0276_emc-000107-02.pdf |publisher= EPA |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Label Requirements of specialty and other bagged fertilizers |url= http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1569_16993_19405-49343--,00.html |publisher= Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref> The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; the third,  K<sub>2</sub>O.

These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a [[Chelation|chelate complex]], e.g., the [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] derivative.

In rare cases, fields are treated with the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble [[Phosphite anion|salts]] are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as [[phosphate rock]].  The main minerals are [[fluorapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F (CFA) and [[hydroxyapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH.  These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or [[phosphoric acid]]s (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). The large production of [[sulfuric acid]] as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds relate to this basic process.\n\nIn the [[nitrophosphate process]] or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>).

Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) (common [[salt]]).  Sometimes potash is referred to as K<sub>2</sub>O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content.  In fact, potash fertilizers are usually [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium carbonate]], or [[potassium nitrate]].<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n===Compound fertilizers===\nCompound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers.

It is an immature form of coal and improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water but confers no nutritional value to the plants. It is therefore not a fertilizer as defined in the beginning of the article, but rather an amendment. [[Coir]], (derived from coconut husks), bark, and sawdust when added to soil all act similarly (but not identically) to peat and are also considered organic soil amendments - or texturizers - because of their limited nutritive inputs.  Some organic additives can have a reverse effect on nutrients \u2014 fresh sawdust can consume soil nutrients as it breaks down, and may lower soil pH \u2014 but these same organic texturizers (as well as compost, etc.) may increase the availability of nutrients through improved cation exchange, or through increased growth of microorganisms that in turn increase availability of certain plant nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as composts and manures may be distributed locally without going into industry production, making actual consumption more difficult to quantify.\n\n==Application==<!--need timing of application, methods for applying-->\n[[File:7252 Hand top-dressing of super phosphate on Banks Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Applying [[Monocalcium phosphate|super phosphate]] fertilizer by hand, New Zealand, 1938]]\nFertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a [[soil test]] and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n===Liquid vs solid===\nFertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are [[urea]], diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride.<ref name=\"IFA2017\">{{cite web|title=About Fertilizers Home Page|url=https://www.fertilizer.org/En/Knowledge_Resources/About_Fertilizers/About_Fertilizers_Home_Page.aspx?|website=www.fertilizer.org|publisher=International Fertilizer Association|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered.  Often solids are available as [[prill]]s, a solid globule.  Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea.  These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., [[UAN]]). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage.<ref name=Ull/>  The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called \"[[fertigation]]\".<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n=== Slow- and controlled-release fertilizers ===\nSlow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the fertilizer market (1995). Their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes.  In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant.  Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation.  Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching.  Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. [[Isobutylidenediurea]] (\"IBDU\") and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants.  IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH(NHC(O)NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)NH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>.\n\nBesides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients, slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water.<ref name=SRN/> Slow-release fertilizers (various forms including fertilizer spikes, tabs, etc.) reduce the problem of \"burning\" the plants due to excess nitrogen. Polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a 'true time-release' or 'staged nutrient release' (SNR) of fertilizer nutrients.\n\nControlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate.  Sulfur is a typical encapsulation material.  Other coated products use thermoplastics (and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants, etc.) to produce diffusion-controlled release of [[urea]] or other fertilizers. \"Reactive Layer Coating\" can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. \"Multicote\" is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat.\n\n===Foliar application===\nFoliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. This method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high-value crops such as fruits.<ref name=Ull/>\n[[File:Fertilizer-Burn.jpg|upright|thumb|Fertilizer burn]]\n\n===Chemicals that affect nitrogen uptake===\nVarious chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers.  In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off.  Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching.  1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), [[dicyandiamide]], nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are popular.<ref name=\"YangFang2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Ming|last2=Fang|first2=Yunting|last3=Sun|first3=Di|last4=Shi|first4=Yuanliang|title=Efficiency of two nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide and 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate) on soil nitrogen transformations and plant productivity: a meta-analysis|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=22075|year=2016|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep22075|pmid=26902689|bibcode=2016NatSR...622075Y|pmc=4763264}}</ref> Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification.

In 2008, Chinese governments began to partially withdraw fertilizer subsidies, including subsidies to fertilizer transportation and to electricity and natural gas use in the industry. In consequence, the price of fertilizer has gone up and large-scale farms have begun to use less fertilizer. If large-scale farms keep reducing their use of fertilizer subsidies, they have no choice but to optimize the fertilizer they have which would therefore gain an increase in both grain yield and profit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Xiaotang|last2=B.Gu, Y.

They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Reuse of urine demonstration - fertilised and not fertilised tomato plant experiment (3617543234).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Six tomato plants grown with and without nitrate fertilizer on nutrient-poor sand/clay soil. One of the plants in the nutrient-poor soil has died.]]\nFertilizers  enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients.  The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration.  This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect.\nFertilizers typically provide, in varying [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]]:<ref name=Ull/>\n* three main macronutrients:\n** [[Nitrogen]] (N): leaf growth\n** [[Phosphorus]] (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;\n** [[Potassium]] (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting;\n* three secondary macronutrients: [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S);\n* micronutrients: [[copper]] (Cu), [[Iron fertilisation|iron]] (Fe), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[boron]] (B). Of occasional significance are [[silicon]] (Si), [[cobalt]] (Co), and [[vanadium]] (V).\n\nThe nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers.  Instead [[chemical compound|compounds]] containing these elements are the basis of fertilizers.  The macro-nutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a [[dry matter]] (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.  Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and other components (e.g., [[chlorophyll]]).  To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a \"fixed\" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably [[legume]]s) can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) by converting it to [[ammonia]].  Phosphate is required for the production of DNA and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids.\n\nMicronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of [[Parts-per notation|parts-per-million]] (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm or less than 0.04% dry matter.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aesl.ces.uga.edu/publications/plant/Nutrient.asp|title = AESL Plant Analysis Handbook&nbsp;\u2013 Nutrient Content of Plant|publisher = Aesl.ces.uga.edu|date = |access-date = 11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills and Jones, 1996\">{{cite book|author1=H.A.

Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.\n\n==Classification==\nFertilizers are classified in several ways.  They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as \"straight fertilizers.\"  \"Multinutrient fertilizers\" (or \"complex fertilizers\") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P.  Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic.  Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except [[ureas]].  Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter.  Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.<ref>J.

[[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is also widely used. [[Urea]] is another popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage that it is solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate, respectively.

[[Triple superphosphate]] (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.\n\nThe main potassium-based straight fertilizer is Muriate of Potash (MOP).  Muriate of Potash consists of 95-99% KCl, and is typically available as 0-0-60 or 0-0-62 fertilizer.\n\n===Multinutrient fertilizers===\nThese fertilizers are common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.\n\n====Binary (NP, NK, PK) fertilizers====\nMajor two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are [[monoammonium phosphate]] (MAP) and [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.\n\n====NPK fertilizers====\n{{Main|Labeling of fertilizer}}\nNPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n[[NPK rating]] is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Summary of State Fertilizer Laws |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/dec03/121503/02N-0276_emc-000107-02.pdf |publisher= EPA |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Label Requirements of specialty and other bagged fertilizers |url= http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1569_16993_19405-49343--,00.html |publisher= Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref> The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; the third,  K<sub>2</sub>O.

These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a [[Chelation|chelate complex]], e.g., the [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] derivative.

In rare cases, fields are treated with the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble [[Phosphite anion|salts]] are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as [[phosphate rock]].  The main minerals are [[fluorapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F (CFA) and [[hydroxyapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH.  These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or [[phosphoric acid]]s (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). The large production of [[sulfuric acid]] as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds relate to this basic process.\n\nIn the [[nitrophosphate process]] or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a ''compound fertilizer'' with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.<ref name=EFMA2000>{{cite web|last1=EFMA|title=Best available techniques for pollution prevention and control in the European fertilizer industry.

Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) (common [[salt]]).  Sometimes potash is referred to as K<sub>2</sub>O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content.  In fact, potash fertilizers are usually [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium carbonate]], or [[potassium nitrate]].<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n===Compound fertilizers===\nCompound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers.  In some cases, chemical reactions occur between the two or more components.  For example, monoammonium and diammonium phosphates, which provide plants with both N and P, are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (from phosphate rock) and ammonia :\n:NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>\n:2 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>\n\n=== Organic fertilizers ===\n{{Main|Organic fertilizer}}\n[[File:HomeComposting Roubaix Fr59.JPG|thumb|Compost bin for small-scale production of organic fertilizer]]\n[[File:Krechty kompostarna.jpg|thumb|A large commercial compost operation]]\n\n\u201c[[Organic fertilizer]]s\u201d can describe those fertilizers with an organic \u2014 biologic \u2014 origin\u2014that is, fertilizers derived from living or formerly living materials.

It is an immature form of coal and improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water but confers no nutritional value to the plants. It is therefore not a fertilizer as defined in the beginning of the article, but rather an amendment. [[Coir]], (derived from coconut husks), bark, and sawdust when added to soil all act similarly (but not identically) to peat and are also considered organic soil amendments - or texturizers - because of their limited nutritive inputs.  Some organic additives can have a reverse effect on nutrients \u2014 fresh sawdust can consume soil nutrients as it breaks down, and may lower soil pH \u2014 but these same organic texturizers (as well as compost, etc.) may increase the availability of nutrients through improved cation exchange, or through increased growth of microorganisms that in turn increase availability of certain plant nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as composts and manures may be distributed locally without going into industry production, making actual consumption more difficult to quantify.\n\n==Application==<!--need timing of application, methods for applying-->\n[[File:7252 Hand top-dressing of super phosphate on Banks Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Applying [[Monocalcium phosphate|super phosphate]] fertilizer by hand, New Zealand, 1938]]\nFertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a [[soil test]] and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n===Liquid vs solid===\nFertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are [[urea]], diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride.<ref name=\"IFA2017\">{{cite web|title=About Fertilizers Home Page|url=https://www.fertilizer.org/En/Knowledge_Resources/About_Fertilizers/About_Fertilizers_Home_Page.aspx?|website=www.fertilizer.org|publisher=International Fertilizer Association|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered.  Often solids are available as [[prill]]s, a solid globule.  Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea.  These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., [[UAN]]). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage.<ref name=Ull/>  The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called \"[[fertigation]]\".<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n=== Slow- and controlled-release fertilizers ===\nSlow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the fertilizer market (1995). Their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes.  In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant.  Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation.  Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching.  Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. [[Isobutylidenediurea]] (\"IBDU\") and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants.  IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH(NHC(O)NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)NH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>.\n\nBesides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients, slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water.<ref name=SRN/> Slow-release fertilizers (various forms including fertilizer spikes, tabs, etc.) reduce the problem of \"burning\" the plants due to excess nitrogen. Polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a 'true time-release' or 'staged nutrient release' (SNR) of fertilizer nutrients.\n\nControlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate.  Sulfur is a typical encapsulation material.  Other coated products use thermoplastics (and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants, etc.) to produce diffusion-controlled release of [[urea]] or other fertilizers. \"Reactive Layer Coating\" can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. \"Multicote\" is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat.\n\n===Foliar application===\nFoliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. This method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high-value crops such as fruits.<ref name=Ull/>\n[[File:Fertilizer-Burn.jpg|upright|thumb|Fertilizer burn]]\n\n===Chemicals that affect nitrogen uptake===\nVarious chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers.  In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off.  Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching.  1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), [[dicyandiamide]], nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are popular.<ref name=\"YangFang2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Ming|last2=Fang|first2=Yunting|last3=Sun|first3=Di|last4=Shi|first4=Yuanliang|title=Efficiency of two nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide and 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate) on soil nitrogen transformations and plant productivity: a meta-analysis|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=22075|year=2016|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep22075|pmid=26902689|bibcode=2016NatSR...622075Y|pmc=4763264}}</ref> Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification.

After the gang is involved in a fight, Krishnan kills a police officer while trying to save Ganga. He then goes to jail and returns to Kammattippaadam only to discover that the gang is now more advanced and are smuggling spirit under the leadership of Surendran/Aashaan. The gang creates a lot of enemies which includes Johnny. Krishnan discovers that Ganga is also in love with Anitha and is planning to get married soon. The gang destroying the homes of the locals leaves Ganga's grandfather devastated. He dies of shock when he discovers that his grandchildren have no love for him.\n\nBalettan who is now a changed man after his grandfather's death wants to stop everything. One night Balan's wife demands to go to medical shop to get some supplies. They are accompanied by both Ganga and Krishnan. Balettan says that he wants to stop his criminal activity and simply wants to live happily with his family in Kammattippaadam by starting a travel agency. During their conversation about Anitha, Balan mentions his wish to see Krishnan marry her and this causes Ganga and Balan to end up in a fight. Ganga gets out of the car. Later, Balan, Krishnan and Balan's wife Rosamma reach the nearby medical shop. Rosamma and Krishnan get out of the car and walk towards the medical shop.

He also appreciated the brilliant performance of actors in the movie. Rajeev Ravi wrote in an article in \u2018Deshabhimani\u2019 few days after the release of the movie that that the word \u2018Pulayan\u2019 was not allowed to be used even once in the movie by the Censor Board. Ernakulam was a small town during the early 1950s, and during the first communist government of EMS Namboodiripad in 1957, small tracts of farm land were given to all landless community, mainly to the Dalit community, under the Land Reforms Ordinance Act. But following the Economic Liberalisation of 1991, Kochi boomed into a metro city, and real estate skyrocketed. The then government set up Greater Cochin Development Authority, which helped the real estate boom, all the while paddy fields were converted to housing boards, luxury villas and apartments. Kammatipadam shows how the Dalits were forced to sell out their lands to the real estate mafia.\n\nGowtham VS of ''[[The Indian Express]]'' wrote: \"Rajiv Ravi has dismantled all conventional concepts of Malayali aesthetics by capturing the unadulterated beauty of black skin through characters who portrayed the lives of Dalits. The director has continued to use his anarchic concepts of visualisation, which include shaky shots, blurred frames and sometimes abrupt sequences. The realistic and daring approach of Rajiv Ravi deserves standing ovation at times when the paper tigers in this industry still fear to come up with something different from the old mould.\"<ref>Gowtham VS (21 May 2016).

He also appreciated the brilliant performance of actors in the movie. Rajeev Ravi wrote in an article in \u2018Deshabhimani\u2019 few days after the release of the movie that that the word \u2018Pulayan\u2019 was not allowed to be used even once in the movie by the Censor Board. Ernakulam was a small town during the early 1950s, and during the first communist government of EMS Namboodiripad in 1957, small tracts of farm land were given to all landless community, mainly to the Dalit community, under the Land Reforms Ordinance Act. But following the Economic Liberalisation of 1991, Kochi boomed into a metro city, and real estate skyrocketed. The then government set up Greater Cochin Development Authority, which helped the real estate boom, all the while paddy fields were converted to housing boards, luxury villas and apartments. Kammatipadam shows how the Dalits were forced to sell out their lands to the real estate mafia.\n\nGowtham VS of ''[[The Indian Express]]'' wrote: \"Rajiv Ravi has dismantled all conventional concepts of Malayali aesthetics by capturing the unadulterated beauty of black skin through characters who portrayed the lives of Dalits. The director has continued to use his anarchic concepts of visualisation, which include shaky shots, blurred frames and sometimes abrupt sequences. The realistic and daring approach of Rajiv Ravi deserves standing ovation at times when the paper tigers in this industry still fear to come up with something different from the old mould.\"<ref>Gowtham VS (21 May 2016).

His books have been published in over twenty languages worldwide. He has written nine works of non-fiction, a thriller, two comic novels and three books for young children. He is best known for his 1999 best-selling title, ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'', a historical account of the violent struggle between the English and Dutch for control of the world supply of nutmeg in the early 17th century.\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in [[Buckinghamshire]], Milton was educated at [[Latymer Upper School]] and the [[University of Bristol]]. He lives in London and Burgundy and is married to the artist and illustrator, [[Alexandra Milton]]. He has three daughters.\n\n==Works==\nHe is best known for his 1999 best-selling title, ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'', a historical account of the violent struggle between the English and Dutch for control of the world supply of nutmeg in the early 17th century. The book was serialised by BBC Radio 4.<ref>''[[Book of the Week]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 26\u201330 April 1999, read by [[Ben Onwukwe]].</ref> ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' was followed by ''Big Chief Elizabeth'', ''Samurai William'' and ''White Gold'', books of narrative non-fiction that took as their subject matter the pioneering English adventurers in Asia, North Africa and the New World, and then by his 2008, ''Paradise Lost, Smyrna 1922: The Destruction of Islam's City of Tolerance'', which investigated the bloody sacking of [[Smyrna]] in September 1922. This was followed by ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'', 2012, and ''Russian Roulette: How British Spies Thwarted Lenin's Global Plot'', which was published in the summer of 2013 in the UK and in April, 2014 in North America.''Fascinating Footnotes from History'' was published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] on 24 September 2015.\n\nMilton's book \"'Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'', was published by John Murray in the UK (June 2016). It became a Sunday Times Top Ten bestseller in its first week. It tells the story of [[Winston Churchill]]'s inner circle of experts on [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]] - six men who planned all the most audacious behind-enemy-lines attacks of the [[Second World War]]. The book is published by [[Picador]] in the US.\n\nMilton sits on the board of trustees of the [[London Library]].\n\n== Interests and influences ==\nThe author's early non-fiction titles display a particular interest in the lesser known adventurers of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the ill-treatment of indigenous populations as the first English merchants and traders moved into newly colonized lands. More recent titles have been concerned with 20th century history.\n\nThe early books draw on unpublished source material \u2013 diaries, journals and private letters \u2013 as well as archival documentation kept by the [[East India Company]] and now housed in the British Library. He also cites contemporary published accounts, notably the 1589 anthology, ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation'' by [[Richard Hakluyt]] and ''Purchas, his Pilgrimage; or, Relations of the World and the Religions observed in all Ages'', 1613, by [[Samuel Purchas]]. In researching his 2008 work, ''Paradise Lost, Smyrna 1922'', he collected an extensive archive of unpublished diaries and private letters written by the Levantines of Smyrna.<ref>The author has expressed his intention to deposit this archive in Exeter University Library.</ref>\n\nHis book, ''Russian Roulette'' was an account of a small group of British spies smuggled into [[Moscow]], [[Petrograd]] and [[Tashkent]] in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]]. It was drawn from previously unpublished sources held in the archives of [[Indian Political Intelligence]].\n\n== ''D-Day: The Soldiers' Story'' ==\n\n''D-Day: The Soldiers' Story'' is Milton's eleventh work of narrative history. It narrates the events of [[D-Day]] - 6 June 1944 - through the tales of survivors from all sides: teenage Allied conscripts, German defenders and French resistance fighters.\n\nThe narrative reveals the terror of those trapped in the frontline of [[Operation Overlord]]. It also gives voice to some who have hitherto remained unheard \u2013 the French butcher's daughter, the Panzer Commander's wife, the chauffeur to the General Staff.\n\nThe research was drawn from original source material: oral interviews, handwritten diaries and typescript accounts. Milton's gave voice to the raw, unvarnished experiences of those who were there. The book was published on 20 September 2018 in the UK and in 2019 in the USA.\n\n== ''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'' ==\n\n''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'' is Milton's tenth work of narrative history. It became an immediate bestseller, entering the [[Sunday Times]] bestseller list in the week of publication.\n\nIt tells the story of a secret irregular warfare organisation that was founded in London in the spring of 1939. Its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler's war machine through acts of sabotage. Starting as two separate but linked organisations, Section D and MI(R), it was later expanded into two new organisations, the [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MD1]]. These worked together, with SOE plotting missions and training saboteurs and MD1 producing bespoke weaponry.\n\nSix key individuals worked at the heart of these two guerrilla units: [[Colin Gubbins]], [[Millis Jefferis]], [[Cecil Vandepeer Clarke]], [[Eric A. Sykes]], [[William Fairbairn]] and George Rheam. These gentleman mavericks, who were all creative in their approach to warfare, planned most of the most spectacular acts of sabotage of the Second World War. Their missions included [[Operation Josephine B]], [[Operation Postmaster]], [[Operation Chariot]], [[Operation Anthropoid]], [[Operation Gunnerside]], the destruction of the [[Peugeot]] factory at Sochaux and many smaller missions conducted in the weeks prior to the [[Normandy landings]].\n\nTheir work was hailed by General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as playing \"a very considerable part in our complete and final victory\".<ref>\"Documents 12618: SHAEF report into the Special Operations Executive's work\", ''Imperial War Museum'', June 1944.</ref>\n\n== ''Fascinating Footnotes From History'' ==\n''Fascinating Footnotes From History'' is Milton's ninth narrative history book. Published in 2015 in the UK, it is a collection of little-known stories from world history previously published as 4 e-books (''When Hitler Took Cocaine'', ''When Stalin Robbed a Bank'', ''When Lenin Lost His Brain'', and ''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Fascinating Footnotes from History \u2013 with Giles Milton |url=http://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/fascinating-footnotes-from-history/ |website=Rakuten Kobo, an eReading service by Rakuten, Inc |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> The true stories come from Milton's own research and include topics like [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[cocaine]] use, criminal experience of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[assassination]] of [[Grigori Rasputin]] and different information about [[Winston Churchill]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Agatha Christie]] and other 20th century famous people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fascinating Footnotes from History \u2013 with Giles Milton |url=http://dublinfestivalofhistory.ie/event/fascinating-footnotes-from-history-with-giles-milton/ |website=The Dublin Festival of History |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The book is only available in the United States as 2 separate novels: ''When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain: History's Unknown Chapters'' and ''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed A Bank''.<ref>{{cite web |title=amazon.com entry for Giles Milton\n |url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=giles+milton |website=amazon.com |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== ''Russian Roulette'' ==\n\n''Russian Roulette'' is Milton's eighth work of narrative history.\n\nIt is an historical account of a small group of British spies smuggled into Soviet Russia in the aftermath of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The spies were sent to Russia by [[Mansfield Cumming]], the first director of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]. The aim was to thwart Lenin's Bolshevik-Islamic plot to topple British India and, ultimately, the Western democracies.\n[[File:19170704 Riot on Nevsky prosp Petrograd.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Street demonstration on [[Nevsky Prospekt]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] just after troops of the Provisional Government opened fire in the July Days.

They worked undercover and in disguise, operating out of [[Moscow]] and [[Petrograd]].\n\nA second group of British agents was simultaneously sent into [[Central Asia]] (notably [[Tashkent]]). [[Frederick Marshman Bailey|Frederick Bailey]] and [[Wilfrid Malleson]] were employed by [[Indian Political Intelligence]], a body working closely with the Secret Intelligence Service.\n\nIn the period between 1918 and 1921 the spies in Moscow infiltrated Soviet commissariats, the [[Red Army]] and [[Cheka]] (secret police). They were variously involved in murder, deception and duplicity and, together with the British diplomat [[Robert Bruce Lockhart]], were also implicated in a botched attempt to assassinate Lenin.\n\nThe spies in Tashkent and Kashgar saw themselves as playing the final chapter of the [[Great Game]], the struggle for political mastery of Central Asia. \nMilton argues that the greatest achievement of these two groups of spies was to infiltrate the [[Comintern]] and unpick Lenin's plan for global revolution. \nThe spies in Russian Roulette laid the foundation stones for today's professional secret services and were the inspiration for many fictional heroes, from [[James Bond]] to [[Jason Bourne]].\n\nMilton's book also gives a detailed account of [[Winston Churchill]]'s chemical weapon campaign against [[Bolshevik]] forces in northern Russia in 1919.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/sep/01/winston-churchill-shocking-use-chemical-weapons |title=Winston Churchill's shocking use of chemical weapons |first=Giles |last=Milton |date=1 September 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Russian Roulette'' is drawn from previously unknown secret documents held in the Indian Political Intelligence archives and in the [[National Archives]].\n\n== ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'' ==\n\n''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'' is Milton's seventh work of narrative non-fiction. It recounts the early life of [[Wolfram Aichele]], a young artist whose formative years were spent in the shadow of the [[Third Reich]].\n\nWolfram Aichele's parents were deeply hostile to the [[Nazis]]. Many of their interests, including [[freemasonry]] and the philosophy of [[Rudolf Steiner]], conflicted with the politics of [[Nazism]]. Wolfram's father, the artist [[Erwin Aichele]], managed to avoid joining the Nazi Party. But he could do nothing to prevent his son being drafted into the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] or Reich Labour Service in 1942, the first step into the [[Wehrmacht]].\n\n[[File:American Soldiers Landing at Utah Beach.jpg|thumb|right|American forces move inland from Utah Beach. Wolfram Aichele's regiment was sent to halt their advance.]]\n\nAichele was sent to the [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]], where he contracted a life-threatening strain of [[diphtheria]]. In 1944 he was sent to [[Normandy]] in France, where he served in the [[77th Infantry Division (Germany)|77th Infantry Division]] as a 'funker' or [[Morse code]] operator. He took part in the German army's doomed attempt to halt American troops from breaking out of their beachhead on [[Utah Beach]].\n\nWolfram Aichele survived a massive aerial bombardment in June 1944. Two months later, he surrendered to American forces and was a prisoner of war, first in England and then in America, where he was interned at [[Camp Gruber]] in [[Oklahoma]]. When he returned to Germany in 1946, he discovered that his home town, [[Pforzheim]], had been more than 80% destroyed in the [[Royal Air Force]]'s firestorm raid of 23 February 1945.\n\nMilton's book received widespread critical acclaim for its use of original unpublished source material and its account of the lives of ordinary Germans. In America, the book is published under the title ''The Boy Who Went to War: The Story of a Reluctant German Soldier in World War II''.\n\n== ''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' ==\n\n[[File:Smyrna-burn-13d17h-start.jpg|thumb|The start of the fire, seen from Bella Vista. 13.Sep.1922]]\n[[File:Smyrna-burn-13t14d-quay-buildings2-1922.jpg|thumb|Buildings on fire and people trying to escape.]]\n\n''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' is Milton's sixth work of narrative history. It is a graphic account of the bloody sacking of [[Smyrna]] (modern [[Izmir]]) in September 1922, and subsequent expulsion of 1,300,000 Orthodox Greeks from Turkey and 350,000 Muslims from Greece is recounted through the eyes of the Levantine community.

Cosmopolitan, rich and tolerant in matters of religion, it was the only city in Turkey with a majority Christian population. Her unusual demographic had earned her the epithet '[[giaour]]' or 'infidel'. Tensions between Smyrna's Christians and Muslims had first been inflamed by the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913. These tensions were to increase dramatically during the [[First World War]]. The majority of Smyrna's population \u2013 including the city's politically astute governor, Rahmi Bey \u2013 favoured the Allied cause. They hoped that Turkey, along with her [[Central Powers]] partners, would lose the war. The city's political position was to be a subject of intense debate at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. Greece's Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], had long dreamed of incorporating the city into a newly revived Greek Empire in [[Asia Minor]] \u2013 the so-called [[Megali Idea]] or Great Idea, and argued his case with considerable aplomb: American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Britain's Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] eventually consented to Greek troops being landed in Smyrna.\n\n''Paradise Lost'' chronicles the violence that followed the Greek landing through the eyewitness accounts of the Levantine community. The author offers a reappraisal of Smyrna's first Greek governor, [[Aristidis Stergiadis]], whose impartiality towards both Greeks and Turks won him considerable enmity amongst the local Greek population.\n\nThe Greek army was despatched into the interior of [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to crush the fledgling army of the Turkish Nationalists, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]]. The book provides a graphic account of this doomed military campaign: by the summer of 1922, the Greek army was desperately short of supplies, weaponry and money. Kemal seized the moment and attacked.\n\n[[File:Great Fire of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Fire of Smyrna]], 14 September 1922]]\n\nThe third section of ''Paradise Lost'' is a day-by-day account of what happened when the Turkish army entered Smyrna. The narrative is constructed from accounts written principally by [[Levant]]ines and Americans who witnessed the violence first hand, in which the author seeks to apportion blame and discover who started the conflagration that was to cause the city's near-total destruction. The book' also investigates the cynical role played by the commanders of the 21 Allied battleships in the bay of Smyrna, who were under orders to rescue only their own nationals, abandoning to their fate the hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Armenian refugees gathered on the quayside.\n\nMany were saved only when a lone American charity worker named Asa Jennings commandeered a fleet of Greek ships and ordered them to sail into the bay of Smyrna. Jennings mission was, contends Milton, one of the greatest humanitarian rescue missions of the 20th century.\n\n''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' ends with the exodus of two million Greeks from Turkey and the expulsion of 400,000 Turks from Greece \u2013 an exchange of population that was enshrined in law in the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].\n\n== ''White Gold'' ==\n\n[[File:Geromeslavemarket.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Slave Market'' (c. 1884), painting by [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] conception of a North African slave market.]]\n\n''White Gold'' investigates the slave trade in North Africa \u2013 the [[Barbary slave trade|enslavement of white people]] that saw almost one million Europeans enslaved between 1600 and 1800, and mirrored its black counterpart in the cruelty and degradation of individuals. Milton focuses on the Moroccan slave markets of [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Meknes]], where slaves were fattened up before being sold at auction. The author reconstructs the voyage of an English ship, the ''Francis'', which was captured by [[Barbary corsairs]] in 1716. He investigates the fate of the captured crew, focusing on the cabin boy, [[Thomas Pellow]], who was to be enslaved at the court of the Moroccan sultan for the next twenty three years.\n\nThe sultan, [[Mulay Ismail]], a cruel and capricious master: was in the midst of constructing a vast imperial palace to adorn his capital, [[Meknes]]. The palace was being built as a conscious attempt by Mulay Ismail to outshine his French contemporary, King Louis XIV, whose [[Palace of Versailles]] had been completed a few years earlier. The sultan's slaves \u2013 among them Pellow and his 51 shipmates \u2013 were compelled to work on the palace's construction. It was gruelling physical labour made worse by the brutal slave drivers who beat any slave who slacked in his work.\n\n[[File:Mulay Ismail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sultan Mulay Ismail'' of Morocco, reigned 1672\u20131727.]]\n\nMilton's narrative draws on original documents, unpublished diaries and manuscript letters housed in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] and the [[British Library]] manuscript collection. ''White Gold'' also makes use of the published narrative written by Pellow himself.<ref>''The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow in South Barbary'', London, 1740. The book was republished in 1890 under the title: ''The Adventures of Thomas Pellow of Penryn, Mariner'', edited by Robert Brown. A more recent edition is Magali Morsy's annotated French edition, ''La Relation de Thomas Pellow''.</ref>\n\nOne English slave, Abraham Browne, left a detailed account of his life in the days prior to being sold. He was fed \"fresh vitteles [victuals] once a daye and sometimes twice in abondance, with good white breade from the market place.\" Browne correctly surmised that the bread was \"to feed us up for the markett [so] that we might be in some good plight agaynst the day wee weare to be sold.\"<ref>Quoted in ''White Gold'', p.68.</ref> Once bought, most slaves never again saw freedom. The vast majority were to die in captivity.\n\nThomas Pellow had a different fate: he would eventually escape and make his return to England. He found passage aboard a ship bound for [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. When he arrived home in 1738, 23 years after leaving home, Pellow's parents did not recognise their son.\n\n== ''Samurai William'' ==\n\n[[File:LiefdeShip.jpg|thumb|From left to right: ''Blijde Bootschap'', ''Trouwe'', '' 't Gelooue'', ''Liefde'' or ''Love'' \u2013 William Adams' vessel \u2013 and ''Hoope''. 17th-century engraving.]]\n[[File:HiradoVOCfactory(montanus-1669).jpg|thumb|The Dutch [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] trading factory in Hirado (depicted here) was said to have been much larger than the neighbouring English one. 17th-century engraving.]]\n\n''Samurai William'' is an historical portrayal of the life and adventures of [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams (sailor)]] \u2013 an Elizabethan adventurer who was shipwrecked in Japan in 1600. William Adams's story inspired the 1975 best-selling novel, [[Sh\u014dgun (novel)|Sh\u014dgun]] by [[James Clavell]]., recounting the history of early European contacts with the Japanese sh\u014dgun and the ultimately doomed attempts of the English [[East India Company]] to forge profitable trading links with Japan.\n\nWilliam Adams set sail from Rotterdam in 1598, having been employed as pilot on the Dutch ship ''Liefde'' (Love). The ''Liefde'' was one of five vessels whose ostensible purpose was to head for the Spice Islands or [[Maluku Islands]] of the [[East Indies]]. But the expedition's financiers also encouraged their captains to attack and ransack Spanish possessions on the coast of South America. The fleet was scattered as it emerged through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and into the Pacific Ocean. The captain and crew of the ''Liefde'' \u2013 concerned that their cargo of broadcloth would not have a ready market in the tropical Spice Islands \u2013 took the extraordinary decision to head to Japan, a land of which they were wholly ignorant.\n\nThe voyage was fraught with hardship and suffering: atrocious weather and diminishing supplies soon have a deleterious effect on the men's health. On 12 April 1600, William Adams sighted the coast of Japan: by this time, only 24 crew members were still alive.\n\n[[File:AdamsLetter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Excerpt from a letter written by William Adams at Hirado in Japan to the East India Company in London, 1 December 1613. [[British Library]].]]\n\nThe book makes use of original source documents \u2013 including manuscript letters and journals \u2013 to portray of Adams's two decades in Japan. The book reveals Adams's personal skill in dealing the Japanese and suggests that he was adept at adapting to Japanese culture. He helped his cause by deliberately creating a divide between himself and the Portuguese [[Jesuit missionaries]] who were becoming increasingly unpopular in Japanese courtly circles.\n\nHe soon came to the attention of the ruling shogun, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], for whom he built two European style sailing vessels. Ieyasu rewarded Adams with gifts \u2013 including a country estate near the imperial capital of [[Edo]]. Adams was also honoured with the title of ''hatamoto'' or ''bannerman'', a prestigious position that made him a direct retainer of the shogun's court. It also linked Adams to the warrior class that had dominated Japanese history for centuries: all of Adams's fellow hatamoto were samurai. Adams was by now living like the native Japanese. He spoke the language fluently, wore a courtly [[kimono]] and changed his name to Miura Anjin (Mr Pilot). He also married a Japanese woman of good birth, even though he had left behind a wife and daughter in England.\n\nMuch of ''Samurai William'' deals with the ultimately doomed attempts of the [[East India Company]] to make use of Adams's influence at court in order to open a trading station at [[Hirado]] in south-west Japan. The account of life in [[Hirado]] is told through original sources \u2013 notably the personal diary of [[Richard Cocks]], head of the factory in Hirado, and the journal of Captain [[John Saris]], commander of the ship that brought the East India Company merchants to Japan.\nThe author quotes widely from original documents now housed in the [[British Library]]: these were edited and published by Anthony Farrington in his ''The English Factory in Japan''.\n\n''Samurai William'' provides an account of Adams's death in May 1620, and the sorry decline of the doomed trading post. It ends with the brutal suppression of Christianity in Japan and the closure of the country to foreign trade for more than two centuries.\n\n== ''Big Chief Elizabeth'' ==\n\n[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|thumb|Sketch by John White of [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]] Indians]]\n\n[[File:Sir Walter Raleigh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of Walter Raleigh, near age 32, by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], [[Circa|c.]] 1585|[[Portrait miniature]] of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], ca. 1585]]\n\n''Big Chief Elizabeth'' relates the early attempts by Elizabethan adventurers to colonise the North American continent; the book takes its title from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] Indian word 'weroanza', used by the indigenous population in reference to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It focuses on the pioneering expedition of 1585 to colonise [[Roanoke Island]] in what is now [[North Carolina]] \u2013 an expedition that was financed and backed by the Elizabethan courtier and adventurer, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].\n\nThe historical reconstruction of the attempted settlement makes extensive use of eyewitness accounts written by those who occupied senior positions in Raleigh's expedition \u2013 notably [[Sir Richard Grenville]], [[Ralph Lane]], [[John White (colonist and artist)]] and [[Thomas Harriot]], and details the hardships faced by the colonists as they struggled to survive an increasingly hostile environment. It also seeks to explain the enduring mystery of the lost colonists \u2013 115 men, women and children left behind on Roanoke Island when John White returned to England for help.\n\nMilton's 2013 children's book, ''Children of the Wild'', is a fictional recreation of the Roanoke colony. It uses some of the same original sources, notably Thomas Harriot and John White, for background material.\n\n== ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' ==\n\n[[File:AmboynaFort1655.jpg|thumb|The Dutch and English enclaves at Amboyna (top) and the Banda Islands (bottom). 1655 engraving.]]\n\n''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' follows the battles between English and Dutch merchant adventurers as they competed for control of the world supply of nutmeg, which commanded fabulous prices in the 17th century, because it was widely (and wrongly) thought to cure diseases such as [[bubonic plague|the plague]]. (Nutmeg may in fact have some medicinal properties,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12616960 | volume=24 | title=Pharmacological studies on Myristica fragrans--antidiarrheal, hypnotic, analgesic and hemodynamic (blood pressure) parameters | year=2002 | journal=Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol | pages=675\u201380 | last1 = Grover | first1 = JK | last2 = Khandkar | first2 = S. | last3 = Vats | first3 = V. | last4 = Dhunnoo | first4 = Y. | last5 = Das | first5 = D. | doi=10.1358/mf.2002.24.10.802317}}</ref> but it does not possess the powers attributed to it in the seventeenth century.)\n\n[[File:Myristica fragrans - K\u00f6hler\u2013s Medizinal-Pflanzen-097.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[nutmeg]] plant is native to Indonesia's [[Banda Islands]]. At that time one of the world's most valuable commodities, it drew the first European colonial adventurers to the East Indies, among them Nathaniel Courthope.]]\n\nBy 1616, the Dutch had seized all of the principal islands, leaving [[Run (island)|Run]] as the only one not in their control. On Christmas Day, 1616, the English adventurer (and East India Company employee) [[Nathaniel Courthope]] arrived with two ships and persuaded the native islanders to grant him an exclusive monopoly over their annual nutmeg harvest. The agreement that was signed with the local chieftains did far more than that: the document effectively ceded the islands of Run and Ai to England in perpetuity.  \"And whereas King James by the grace of God is King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, is also by the mercy of God King of Pooloway (Ai Island) and Poolarun (Run Island).\"<ref>Cited in Giles Milton's ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'', p.273.</ref>\n\nFor the next five years, Courthope and his band of starving followers were besieged by a Dutch force one hundred times greater. The Dutch eventually captured Run, destroyed the plantations, and killed Courthope. According to Milton, the English, smarting over their loss of Run, \"responded\" 48 years later (in 1664) by attacking and annexing [[New Netherland]], which they renamed [[Province of New York|New York]].<!--Did he really write that? It sounds just a bit too unlikely.-->\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667, ending the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland and largely agreed to maintain the colonial [[status quo]]. In Milton's narrative, this was in return for the English relinquishing their territorial claim to the island of Run.\n\n== ''The Riddle and the Knight'' ==\n\n[[File:JohnMandeville.jpg|thumb|upright|Full-page portrait of Sir [[John Mandeville]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript version of his work ''Travels''. Created circa 1459.]]\n\nMilton's debut non fiction title, ''The Riddle and the Knight'', is a work of historical detection. It follows the trail of [[Sir John Mandeville]], a medieval knight who claimed to have undertaken a thirty-four year voyage through scores of little known lands, including Persia, Arabia, Ethiopia, India, Sumatra and China. Mandeville subsequently wrote a book about his odyssey: it is widely known as ''The Travels''.\n\n''The Riddle and the Knight'' investigates Sir John Mandeville's purported voyage and the shadowy personal biography of the knight himself. It contends that the widely held assertion<ref>See, for example, the 1883 edition of ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' which says: \"On investigating the sources of the book it will presently be obvious that part at least of the personal history of Mandeville is mere invention. Under these circumstances, the truth of any part of that history, and even the genuineness of the compiler's name, become matter for serious doubt.\"</ref> \u2013 that Mandeville's real identity was John de Bourgogne \u2013 is based on a flawed testimony of the chronicler [[John d'Outremeuse]].\n\nThe book asserts that Mandeville's autobiographical portrait \u2013 in which he claims to be a knight living in [[St Albans]] \u2013 is probably correct. It also contends that Mandeville was forced to flee his native England when his overlord, Humphrey de Bohun, led a troubled rebellion against King Edward II.\n\n''The Riddle and the Knight'' concludes that the greater part of Mandeville's voyage is fabricated or compiled from earlier sources, notably [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] and [[Vincent de Beauvais]]. In spite of Mandeville's extensive borrowings from other works, Milton offers a reappraisal of Mandeville's place in the history of exploration. Mandeville's ''Travels'' captured the imagination of the medieval world and was a source of inspiration to [[Christopher Columbus]] as well as notable figures from the Elizabethan era, including [[Sir Walter Ralegh]] and [[Sir Martin Frobisher]].\n\nMilton assesses Mandeville's influence on English literature. [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], and [[John Keats]] turned to the ''Travels'' for inspiration and until the Victorian era it was Sir John Mandeville, not [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] who was known as the 'father of English prose'. Milton's book seeks to restore Mandeville to his literary pedestal, as well as advancing the thesis that he should also be considered the father of exploration.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n\n* ''The Riddle and the Knight: In Search of Sir [[John Mandeville]]'', 1996\n* ''[[Nathaniel's Nutmeg]]: How One Man's Courage Changed the Course of History'', 1999\n* ''Big Chief Elizabeth: The Adventures and Fate of the First English Colonists in America'', 2000\n* ''Samurai William: The Englishman Who Opened Japan'', 2002\n* ''White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of [[Thomas Pellow]] and North Africa's One Million European Slaves'', 2005, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-79469-2}}\n* ''[[Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922]]'', 2008, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-83786-3}}\n* ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War'', 2011, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-83788-7}}\n* ''Russian Roulette: A Deadly Game: How British Spies Thwarted Lenin's Global Plot'', 2013, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-1-444-73702-8}}\n* ''Fascinating Footnotes from History'', 2015, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].\n*''When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain'', 2016, [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-07877-3}}\n*''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed a Bank'', 2016, [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-07875-9}}\n*''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'', 2016, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]. {{ISBN|978-1-444-79895-1}}\n*''Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day'', 2019, [[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt & Company]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-13492-9}}\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''Edward Trencom's Nose: A Novel of History, Dark Intrigue, and Cheese'', 2007\n* ''According to Arnold: A Novel of Love and Mushrooms'', 2009\n* ''The Perfect Corpse'', September 2014, [[Prospero Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-992-8972-2-2}}\n\n=== Children's books ===\n* ''Call Me Gorgeous'', 2009, [[Alexandra Milton]], illustrator.\n* ''Zebedee's Zoo'', 2009, Kathleen McEwen, illustrator.\n* ''Good Luck Baby Owls'', 2012, [[Alexandra Milton]], illustrator.\n* ''Children of the Wild'', 2013.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.gilesmilton.com/ The official website of Giles Milton]\n* [http://surviving-history.blogspot.com/ Surviving History; Giles Milton's history blog]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milton, Giles}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:People from Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British children's writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century British novelists]]\n[[Category:British historians]]\n[[Category:British male novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century British male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British writer and historian}}\n{{COI|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name          = Giles Milton\n| image         =\n| imagesize     = 280px\n| caption       = Giles Milton\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1966|01|15}}\n| birth_place   = Buckinghamshire\n| occupation    = Writer and Historian\n| nationality   = British\n| children      = Three daughters\n| portaldisp    =\n}}\n'''Giles Milton''' (born 15 January 1966) is a British writer who specialises in [[narrative history]].

The book was serialised by BBC Radio 4.<ref>''[[Book of the Week]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 26\u201330 April 1999, read by [[Ben Onwukwe]].</ref> ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' was followed by ''Big Chief Elizabeth'', ''Samurai William'' and ''White Gold'', books of narrative non-fiction that took as their subject matter the pioneering English adventurers in Asia, North Africa and the New World, and then by his 2008, ''Paradise Lost, Smyrna 1922: The Destruction of Islam's City of Tolerance'', which investigated the bloody sacking of [[Smyrna]] in September 1922. This was followed by ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'', 2012, and ''Russian Roulette: How British Spies Thwarted Lenin's Global Plot'', which was published in the summer of 2013 in the UK and in April, 2014 in North America.''Fascinating Footnotes from History'' was published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] on 24 September 2015.\n\nMilton's book \"'Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'', was published by John Murray in the UK (June 2016). It became a Sunday Times Top Ten bestseller in its first week. It tells the story of [[Winston Churchill]]'s inner circle of experts on [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]] - six men who planned all the most audacious behind-enemy-lines attacks of the [[Second World War]]. The book is published by [[Picador]] in the US.\n\nMilton sits on the board of trustees of the [[London Library]].\n\n== Interests and influences ==\nThe author's early non-fiction titles display a particular interest in the lesser known adventurers of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the ill-treatment of indigenous populations as the first English merchants and traders moved into newly colonized lands. More recent titles have been concerned with 20th century history.\n\nThe early books draw on unpublished source material \u2013 diaries, journals and private letters \u2013 as well as archival documentation kept by the [[East India Company]] and now housed in the British Library. He also cites contemporary published accounts, notably the 1589 anthology, ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation'' by [[Richard Hakluyt]] and ''Purchas, his Pilgrimage; or, Relations of the World and the Religions observed in all Ages'', 1613, by [[Samuel Purchas]]. In researching his 2008 work, ''Paradise Lost, Smyrna 1922'', he collected an extensive archive of unpublished diaries and private letters written by the Levantines of Smyrna.<ref>The author has expressed his intention to deposit this archive in Exeter University Library.</ref>\n\nHis book, ''Russian Roulette'' was an account of a small group of British spies smuggled into [[Moscow]], [[Petrograd]] and [[Tashkent]] in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]]. It was drawn from previously unpublished sources held in the archives of [[Indian Political Intelligence]].\n\n== ''D-Day: The Soldiers' Story'' ==\n\n''D-Day: The Soldiers' Story'' is Milton's eleventh work of narrative history. It narrates the events of [[D-Day]] - 6 June 1944 - through the tales of survivors from all sides: teenage Allied conscripts, German defenders and French resistance fighters.\n\nThe narrative reveals the terror of those trapped in the frontline of [[Operation Overlord]]. It also gives voice to some who have hitherto remained unheard \u2013 the French butcher\u2019s daughter, the Panzer Commander\u2019s wife, the chauffeur to the General Staff.\n\nThe research was drawn from original source material: oral interviews, handwritten diaries and typescript accounts. Milton's gave voice to the raw, unvarnished experiences of those who were there. The book was published on 20 September 2018 in the UK and in 2019 in the USA.\n\n== ''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'' ==\n\n''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'' is Milton's tenth work of narrative history. It became an immediate bestseller, entering the [[Sunday Times]] bestseller list in the week of publication.\n\nIt tells the story of a secret irregular warfare organisation that was founded in London in the spring of 1939. Its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler's war machine through acts of sabotage. Starting as two separate but linked organisations, Section D and MI(R), it was later expanded into two new organisations, the [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MD1]]. These worked together, with SOE plotting missions and training saboteurs and MD1 producing bespoke weaponry.\n\nSix key individuals worked at the heart of these two guerrilla units: [[Colin Gubbins]], [[Millis Jefferis]], [[Cecil Vandepeer Clarke]], [[Eric A. Sykes]], [[William Fairbairn]] and George Rheam. These gentleman mavericks, who were all creative in their approach to warfare, planned most of the most spectacular acts of sabotage of the Second World War. Their missions included [[Operation Josephine B]], [[Operation Postmaster]], [[Operation Chariot]], [[Operation Anthropoid]], [[Operation Gunnerside]], the destruction of the [[Peugeot]] factory at Sochaux and many smaller missions conducted in the weeks prior to the [[Normandy landings]].\n\nTheir work was hailed by General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as playing \"a very considerable part in our complete and final victory\".<ref>\"Documents 12618: SHAEF report into the Special Operations Executive's work\", ''Imperial War Museum'', June 1944.</ref>\n\n== ''Fascinating Footnotes From History'' ==\n''Fascinating Footnotes From History'' is Milton's ninth narrative history book. Published in 2015 in the UK, it is a collection of little-known stories from world history previously published as 4 e-books (''When Hitler Took Cocaine'', ''When Stalin Robbed a Bank'', ''When Lenin Lost His Brain'', and ''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Fascinating Footnotes from History \u2013 with Giles Milton |url=http://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/fascinating-footnotes-from-history/ |website=Rakuten Kobo, an eReading service by Rakuten, Inc |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> The true stories come from Milton's own research and include topics like [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[cocaine]] use, criminal experience of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[assassination]] of [[Grigori Rasputin]] and different information about [[Winston Churchill]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Agatha Christie]] and other 20th century famous people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fascinating Footnotes from History \u2013 with Giles Milton |url=http://dublinfestivalofhistory.ie/event/fascinating-footnotes-from-history-with-giles-milton/ |website=The Dublin Festival of History |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The book is only available in the United States as 2 separate novels: ''When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain: History's Unknown Chapters'' and ''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed A Bank''.<ref>{{cite web |title=amazon.com entry for Giles Milton\n |url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=giles+milton |website=amazon.com |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== ''Russian Roulette'' ==\n\n''Russian Roulette'' is Milton's eighth work of narrative history.\n\nIt is an historical account of a small group of British spies smuggled into Soviet Russia in the aftermath of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The spies were sent to Russia by [[Mansfield Cumming]], the first director of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]. The aim was to thwart Lenin's Bolshevik-Islamic plot to topple British India and, ultimately, the Western democracies.\n[[File:19170704 Riot on Nevsky prosp Petrograd.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Street demonstration on [[Nevsky Prospekt]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] just after troops of the Provisional Government opened fire in the July Days. British spies were already working undercover in the city.]]\nThe spies included [[Sidney Reilly]], [[Arthur Ransome]], [[George Alexander Hill|George Hill]], [[Somerset Maugham]], [[Paul Dukes]] and [[Augustus Agar]]. They worked undercover and in disguise, operating out of [[Moscow]] and [[Petrograd]].\n\nA second group of British agents was simultaneously sent into [[Central Asia]] (notably [[Tashkent]]). [[Frederick Marshman Bailey|Frederick Bailey]] and [[Wilfrid Malleson]] were employed by [[Indian Political Intelligence]], a body working closely with the Secret Intelligence Service.\n\nIn the period between 1918 and 1921 the spies in Moscow infiltrated Soviet commissariats, the [[Red Army]] and [[Cheka]] (secret police). They were variously involved in murder, deception and duplicity and, together with the British diplomat [[Robert Bruce Lockhart]], were also implicated in a botched attempt to assassinate Lenin.\n\nThe spies in Tashkent and Kashgar saw themselves as playing the final chapter of the [[Great Game]], the struggle for political mastery of Central Asia. \nMilton argues that the greatest achievement of these two groups of spies was to infiltrate the [[Comintern]] and unpick Lenin's plan for global revolution. \nThe spies in Russian Roulette laid the foundation stones for today's professional secret services and were the inspiration for many fictional heroes, from [[James Bond]] to [[Jason Bourne]].\n\nMilton's book also gives a detailed account of [[Winston Churchill]]'s chemical weapon campaign against [[Bolshevik]] forces in northern Russia in 1919.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/sep/01/winston-churchill-shocking-use-chemical-weapons |title=Winston Churchill's shocking use of chemical weapons |first=Giles |last=Milton |date=1 September 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Russian Roulette'' is drawn from previously unknown secret documents held in the Indian Political Intelligence archives and in the [[National Archives]].\n\n== ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'' ==\n\n''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War'' is Milton's seventh work of narrative non-fiction. It recounts the early life of [[Wolfram Aichele]], a young artist whose formative years were spent in the shadow of the [[Third Reich]].\n\nWolfram Aichele's parents were deeply hostile to the [[Nazis]]. Many of their interests, including [[freemasonry]] and the philosophy of [[Rudolf Steiner]], conflicted with the politics of [[Nazism]]. Wolfram's father, the artist [[Erwin Aichele]], managed to avoid joining the Nazi Party. But he could do nothing to prevent his son being drafted into the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] or Reich Labour Service in 1942, the first step into the [[Wehrmacht]].\n\n[[File:American Soldiers Landing at Utah Beach.jpg|thumb|right|American forces move inland from Utah Beach. Wolfram Aichele's regiment was sent to halt their advance.]]\n\nAichele was sent to the [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]], where he contracted a life-threatening strain of [[diphtheria]]. In 1944 he was sent to [[Normandy]] in France, where he served in the [[77th Infantry Division (Germany)|77th Infantry Division]] as a 'funker' or [[Morse code]] operator. He took part in the German army's doomed attempt to halt American troops from breaking out of their beachhead on [[Utah Beach]].\n\nWolfram Aichele survived a massive aerial bombardment in June 1944. Two months later, he surrendered to American forces and was a prisoner of war, first in England and then in America, where he was interned at [[Camp Gruber]] in [[Oklahoma]]. When he returned to Germany in 1946, he discovered that his home town, [[Pforzheim]], had been more than 80% destroyed in the [[Royal Air Force]]'s firestorm raid of 23 February 1945.\n\nMilton's book received widespread critical acclaim for its use of original unpublished source material and its account of the lives of ordinary Germans. In America, the book is published under the title ''The Boy Who Went to War: The Story of a Reluctant German Soldier in World War II''.\n\n== ''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' ==\n\n[[File:Smyrna-burn-13d17h-start.jpg|thumb|The start of the fire, seen from Bella Vista. 13.Sep.1922]]\n[[File:Smyrna-burn-13t14d-quay-buildings2-1922.jpg|thumb|Buildings on fire and people trying to escape.]]\n\n''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' is Milton's sixth work of narrative history. It is a graphic account of the bloody sacking of [[Smyrna]] (modern [[Izmir]]) in September 1922, and subsequent expulsion of 1,300,000 Orthodox Greeks from Turkey and 350,000 Muslims from Greece is recounted through the eyes of the Levantine community.

Cosmopolitan, rich and tolerant in matters of religion, it was the only city in Turkey with a majority Christian population. Her unusual demographic had earned her the epithet '[[giaour]]' or 'infidel'. Tensions between Smyrna's Christians and Muslims had first been inflamed by the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913. These tensions were to increase dramatically during the [[First World War]]. The majority of Smyrna's population \u2013 including the city's politically astute governor, Rahmi Bey \u2013 favoured the Allied cause. They hoped that Turkey, along with her [[Central Powers]] partners, would lose the war. The city's political position was to be a subject of intense debate at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. Greece's Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], had long dreamed of incorporating the city into a newly revived Greek Empire in [[Asia Minor]] \u2013 the so-called [[Megali Idea]] or Great Idea, and argued his case with considerable aplomb: American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Britain's Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] eventually consented to Greek troops being landed in Smyrna.\n\n''Paradise Lost'' chronicles the violence that followed the Greek landing through the eyewitness accounts of the Levantine community. The author offers a reappraisal of Smyrna's first Greek governor, [[Aristidis Stergiadis]], whose impartiality towards both Greeks and Turks won him considerable enmity amongst the local Greek population.\n\nThe Greek army was despatched into the interior of [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to crush the fledgling army of the Turkish Nationalists, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]]. The book provides a graphic account of this doomed military campaign: by the summer of 1922, the Greek army was desperately short of supplies, weaponry and money. Kemal seized the moment and attacked.\n\n[[File:Great Fire of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Fire of Smyrna]], 14 September 1922]]\n\nThe third section of ''Paradise Lost'' is a day-by-day account of what happened when the Turkish army entered Smyrna. The narrative is constructed from accounts written principally by [[Levant]]ines and Americans who witnessed the violence first hand, in which the author seeks to apportion blame and discover who started the conflagration that was to cause the city's near-total destruction. The book' also investigates the cynical role played by the commanders of the 21 Allied battleships in the bay of Smyrna, who were under orders to rescue only their own nationals, abandoning to their fate the hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Armenian refugees gathered on the quayside.\n\nMany were saved only when a lone American charity worker named Asa Jennings commandeered a fleet of Greek ships and ordered them to sail into the bay of Smyrna. Jennings mission was, contends Milton, one of the greatest humanitarian rescue missions of the 20th century.\n\n''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922'' ends with the exodus of two million Greeks from Turkey and the expulsion of 400,000 Turks from Greece \u2013 an exchange of population that was enshrined in law in the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].\n\n== ''White Gold'' ==\n\n[[File:Geromeslavemarket.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Slave Market'' (c. 1884), painting by [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] conception of a North African slave market.]]\n\n''White Gold'' investigates the slave trade in North Africa \u2013 the [[Barbary slave trade|enslavement of white people]] that saw almost one million Europeans enslaved between 1600 and 1800, and mirrored its black counterpart in the cruelty and degradation of individuals. Milton focuses on the Moroccan slave markets of [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Meknes]], where slaves were fattened up before being sold at auction. The author reconstructs the voyage of an English ship, the ''Francis'', which was captured by [[Barbary corsairs]] in 1716. He investigates the fate of the captured crew, focusing on the cabin boy, [[Thomas Pellow]], who was to be enslaved at the court of the Moroccan sultan for the next twenty three years.\n\nThe sultan, [[Mulay Ismail]], a cruel and capricious master: was in the midst of constructing a vast imperial palace to adorn his capital, [[Meknes]]. The palace was being built as a conscious attempt by Mulay Ismail to outshine his French contemporary, King Louis XIV, whose [[Palace of Versailles]] had been completed a few years earlier. The sultan's slaves \u2013 among them Pellow and his 51 shipmates \u2013 were compelled to work on the palace's construction. It was gruelling physical labour made worse by the brutal slave drivers who beat any slave who slacked in his work.\n\n[[File:Mulay Ismail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sultan Mulay Ismail'' of Morocco, reigned 1672\u20131727.]]\n\nMilton's narrative draws on original documents, unpublished diaries and manuscript letters housed in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] and the [[British Library]] manuscript collection. ''White Gold'' also makes use of the published narrative written by Pellow himself.<ref>''The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow in South Barbary'', London, 1740. The book was republished in 1890 under the title: ''The Adventures of Thomas Pellow of Penryn, Mariner'', edited by Robert Brown. A more recent edition is Magali Morsy's annotated French edition, ''La Relation de Thomas Pellow''.</ref>\n\nOne English slave, Abraham Browne, left a detailed account of his life in the days prior to being sold. He was fed \"fresh vitteles [victuals] once a daye and sometimes twice in abondance, with good white breade from the market place.\" Browne correctly surmised that the bread was \"to feed us up for the markett [so] that we might be in some good plight agaynst the day wee weare to be sold.\"<ref>Quoted in ''White Gold'', p.68.</ref> Once bought, most slaves never again saw freedom. The vast majority were to die in captivity.\n\nThomas Pellow had a different fate: he would eventually escape and make his return to England. He found passage aboard a ship bound for [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. When he arrived home in 1738, 23 years after leaving home, Pellow's parents did not recognise their son.\n\n== ''Samurai William'' ==\n\n[[File:LiefdeShip.jpg|thumb|From left to right: ''Blijde Bootschap'', ''Trouwe'', '' 't Gelooue'', ''Liefde'' or ''Love'' \u2013 William Adams' vessel \u2013 and ''Hoope''. 17th-century engraving.]]\n[[File:HiradoVOCfactory(montanus-1669).jpg|thumb|The Dutch [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] trading factory in Hirado (depicted here) was said to have been much larger than the neighbouring English one. 17th-century engraving.]]\n\n''Samurai William'' is an historical portrayal of the life and adventures of [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams (sailor)]] \u2013 an Elizabethan adventurer who was shipwrecked in Japan in 1600. William Adams's story inspired the 1975 best-selling novel, [[Sh\u014dgun (novel)|Sh\u014dgun]] by [[James Clavell]]., recounting the history of early European contacts with the Japanese sh\u014dgun and the ultimately doomed attempts of the English [[East India Company]] to forge profitable trading links with Japan.\n\nWilliam Adams set sail from Rotterdam in 1598, having been employed as pilot on the Dutch ship ''Liefde'' (Love). The ''Liefde'' was one of five vessels whose ostensible purpose was to head for the Spice Islands or [[Maluku Islands]] of the [[East Indies]]. But the expedition's financiers also encouraged their captains to attack and ransack Spanish possessions on the coast of South America. The fleet was scattered as it emerged through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and into the Pacific Ocean. The captain and crew of the ''Liefde'' \u2013 concerned that their cargo of broadcloth would not have a ready market in the tropical Spice Islands \u2013 took the extraordinary decision to head to Japan, a land of which they were wholly ignorant.\n\nThe voyage was fraught with hardship and suffering: atrocious weather and diminishing supplies soon have a deleterious effect on the men's health. On 12 April 1600, William Adams sighted the coast of Japan: by this time, only 24 crew members were still alive.\n\n[[File:AdamsLetter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Excerpt from a letter written by William Adams at Hirado in Japan to the East India Company in London, 1 December 1613. [[British Library]].]]\n\nThe book makes use of original source documents \u2013 including manuscript letters and journals \u2013 to portray of Adams's two decades in Japan. The book reveals Adams's personal skill in dealing the Japanese and suggests that he was adept at adapting to Japanese culture. He helped his cause by deliberately creating a divide between himself and the Portuguese [[Jesuit missionaries]] who were becoming increasingly unpopular in Japanese courtly circles.\n\nHe soon came to the attention of the ruling shogun, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], for whom he built two European style sailing vessels. Ieyasu rewarded Adams with gifts \u2013 including a country estate near the imperial capital of [[Edo]]. Adams was also honoured with the title of ''hatamoto'' or ''bannerman'', a prestigious position that made him a direct retainer of the shogun's court. It also linked Adams to the warrior class that had dominated Japanese history for centuries: all of Adams's fellow hatamoto were samurai. Adams was by now living like the native Japanese. He spoke the language fluently, wore a courtly [[kimono]] and changed his name to Miura Anjin (Mr Pilot). He also married a Japanese woman of good birth, even though he had left behind a wife and daughter in England.\n\nMuch of ''Samurai William'' deals with the ultimately doomed attempts of the [[East India Company]] to make use of Adams's influence at court in order to open a trading station at [[Hirado]] in south-west Japan. The account of life in [[Hirado]] is told through original sources \u2013 notably the personal diary of [[Richard Cocks]], head of the factory in Hirado, and the journal of Captain [[John Saris]], commander of the ship that brought the East India Company merchants to Japan.\nThe author quotes widely from original documents now housed in the [[British Library]]: these were edited and published by Anthony Farrington in his ''The English Factory in Japan''.\n\n''Samurai William'' provides an account of Adams's death in May 1620, and the sorry decline of the doomed trading post. It ends with the brutal suppression of Christianity in Japan and the closure of the country to foreign trade for more than two centuries.\n\n== ''Big Chief Elizabeth'' ==\n\n[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|thumb|Sketch by John White of [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]] Indians]]\n\n[[File:Sir Walter Raleigh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of Walter Raleigh, near age 32, by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], [[Circa|c.]] 1585|[[Portrait miniature]] of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], ca. 1585]]\n\n''Big Chief Elizabeth'' relates the early attempts by Elizabethan adventurers to colonise the North American continent; the book takes its title from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] Indian word 'weroanza', used by the indigenous population in reference to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It focuses on the pioneering expedition of 1585 to colonise [[Roanoke Island]] in what is now [[North Carolina]] \u2013 an expedition that was financed and backed by the Elizabethan courtier and adventurer, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].\n\nThe historical reconstruction of the attempted settlement makes extensive use of eyewitness accounts written by those who occupied senior positions in Raleigh's expedition \u2013 notably [[Sir Richard Grenville]], [[Ralph Lane]], [[John White (colonist and artist)]] and [[Thomas Harriot]], and details the hardships faced by the colonists as they struggled to survive an increasingly hostile environment. It also seeks to explain the enduring mystery of the lost colonists \u2013 115 men, women and children left behind on Roanoke Island when John White returned to England for help.\n\nMilton's 2013 children's book, ''Children of the Wild'', is a fictional recreation of the Roanoke colony. It uses some of the same original sources, notably Thomas Harriot and John White, for background material.\n\n== ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' ==\n\n[[File:AmboynaFort1655.jpg|thumb|The Dutch and English enclaves at Amboyna (top) and the Banda Islands (bottom). 1655 engraving.]]\n\n''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'' follows the battles between English and Dutch merchant adventurers as they competed for control of the world supply of nutmeg, which commanded fabulous prices in the 17th century, because it was widely (and wrongly) thought to cure diseases such as [[bubonic plague|the plague]]. (Nutmeg may in fact have some medicinal properties,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12616960 | volume=24 | title=Pharmacological studies on Myristica fragrans--antidiarrheal, hypnotic, analgesic and hemodynamic (blood pressure) parameters | year=2002 | journal=Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol | pages=675\u201380 | last1 = Grover | first1 = JK | last2 = Khandkar | first2 = S. | last3 = Vats | first3 = V. | last4 = Dhunnoo | first4 = Y. | last5 = Das | first5 = D. | doi=10.1358/mf.2002.24.10.802317}}</ref> but it does not possess the powers attributed to it in the seventeenth century.)\n\n[[File:Myristica fragrans - K\u00f6hler\u2013s Medizinal-Pflanzen-097.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[nutmeg]] plant is native to Indonesia's [[Banda Islands]]. At that time one of the world's most valuable commodities, it drew the first European colonial adventurers to the East Indies, among them Nathaniel Courthope.]]\n\nBy 1616, the Dutch had seized all of the principal islands, leaving [[Run (island)|Run]] as the only one not in their control. On Christmas Day, 1616, the English adventurer (and East India Company employee) [[Nathaniel Courthope]] arrived with two ships and persuaded the native islanders to grant him an exclusive monopoly over their annual nutmeg harvest. The agreement that was signed with the local chieftains did far more than that: the document effectively ceded the islands of Run and Ai to England in perpetuity.  \"And whereas King James by the grace of God is King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, is also by the mercy of God King of Pooloway (Ai Island) and Poolarun (Run Island).\"<ref>Cited in Giles Milton's ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg'', p.273.</ref>\n\nFor the next five years, Courthope and his band of starving followers were besieged by a Dutch force one hundred times greater. The Dutch eventually captured Run, destroyed the plantations, and killed Courthope. According to Milton, the English, smarting over their loss of Run, \"responded\" 48 years later (in 1664) by attacking and annexing [[New Netherland]], which they renamed [[Province of New York|New York]].<!--Did he really write that? It sounds just a bit too unlikely.-->\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667, ending the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland and largely agreed to maintain the colonial [[status quo]]. In Milton's narrative, this was in return for the English relinquishing their territorial claim to the island of Run.\n\n== ''The Riddle and the Knight'' ==\n\n[[File:JohnMandeville.jpg|thumb|upright|Full-page portrait of Sir [[John Mandeville]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript version of his work ''Travels''. Created circa 1459.]]\n\nMilton's debut non fiction title, ''The Riddle and the Knight'', is a work of historical detection. It follows the trail of [[Sir John Mandeville]], a medieval knight who claimed to have undertaken a thirty-four year voyage through scores of little known lands, including Persia, Arabia, Ethiopia, India, Sumatra and China. Mandeville subsequently wrote a book about his odyssey: it is widely known as ''The Travels''.\n\n''The Riddle and the Knight'' investigates Sir John Mandeville's purported voyage and the shadowy personal biography of the knight himself. It contends that the widely held assertion<ref>See, for example, the 1883 edition of ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' which says: \"On investigating the sources of the book it will presently be obvious that part at least of the personal history of Mandeville is mere invention. Under these circumstances, the truth of any part of that history, and even the genuineness of the compiler's name, become matter for serious doubt.\"</ref> \u2013 that Mandeville's real identity was John de Bourgogne \u2013 is based on a flawed testimony of the chronicler [[John d'Outremeuse]].\n\nThe book asserts that Mandeville's autobiographical portrait \u2013 in which he claims to be a knight living in [[St Albans]] \u2013 is probably correct. It also contends that Mandeville was forced to flee his native England when his overlord, Humphrey de Bohun, led a troubled rebellion against King Edward II.\n\n''The Riddle and the Knight'' concludes that the greater part of Mandeville's voyage is fabricated or compiled from earlier sources, notably [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] and [[Vincent de Beauvais]]. In spite of Mandeville's extensive borrowings from other works, Milton offers a reappraisal of Mandeville's place in the history of exploration. Mandeville's ''Travels'' captured the imagination of the medieval world and was a source of inspiration to [[Christopher Columbus]] as well as notable figures from the Elizabethan era, including [[Sir Walter Ralegh]] and [[Sir Martin Frobisher]].\n\nMilton assesses Mandeville's influence on English literature. [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], and [[John Keats]] turned to the ''Travels'' for inspiration and until the Victorian era it was Sir John Mandeville, not [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] who was known as the 'father of English prose'. Milton's book seeks to restore Mandeville to his literary pedestal, as well as advancing the thesis that he should also be considered the father of exploration.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n\n* ''The Riddle and the Knight: In Search of Sir [[John Mandeville]]'', 1996\n* ''[[Nathaniel's Nutmeg]]: How One Man's Courage Changed the Course of History'', 1999\n* ''Big Chief Elizabeth: The Adventures and Fate of the First English Colonists in America'', 2000\n* ''Samurai William: The Englishman Who Opened Japan'', 2002\n* ''White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of [[Thomas Pellow]] and North Africa's One Million European Slaves'', 2005, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-79469-2}}\n* ''[[Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922]]'', 2008, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-83786-3}}\n* ''Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War'', 2011, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-0-340-83788-7}}\n* ''Russian Roulette: A Deadly Game: How British Spies Thwarted Lenin's Global Plot'', 2013, Sceptre, {{ISBN|978-1-444-73702-8}}\n* ''Fascinating Footnotes from History'', 2015, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].\n*''When Hitler Took Cocaine and Lenin Lost His Brain'', 2016, [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-07877-3}}\n*''When Churchill Slaughtered Sheep and Stalin Robbed a Bank'', 2016, [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-07875-9}}\n*''Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'', 2016, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]. {{ISBN|978-1-444-79895-1}}\n*''Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day'', 2019, [[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt & Company]], {{ISBN|978-1-250-13492-9}}\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''Edward Trencom's Nose: A Novel of History, Dark Intrigue, and Cheese'', 2007\n* ''According to Arnold: A Novel of Love and Mushrooms'', 2009\n* ''The Perfect Corpse'', September 2014, [[Prospero Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-992-8972-2-2}}\n\n=== Children's books ===\n* ''Call Me Gorgeous'', 2009, [[Alexandra Milton]], illustrator.\n* ''Zebedee's Zoo'', 2009, Kathleen McEwen, illustrator.\n* ''Good Luck Baby Owls'', 2012, [[Alexandra Milton]], illustrator.\n* ''Children of the Wild'', 2013.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.gilesmilton.com/ The official website of Giles Milton]\n* [http://surviving-history.blogspot.com/ Surviving History; Giles Milton's history blog]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milton, Giles}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:People from Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British children's writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century British novelists]]\n[[Category:British historians]]\n[[Category:British male novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century British male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e''D-Day: The Soldiers' Story'':Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Milton"}

By 1980, Tayburn employed 18 people and began growing a blue chip client book across the UK. In 1981 turnover was \u00a31million and profit \u00a3100,000 and offices were opened in London and Aberdeen.\n\nA management buyout led by Erick Davidson in 1988 meant a majority ownership for the executive directors. Tayburn was by this stage established as a respected design consultancy with many creative awards to its name. During the 1980s their clients included [[BP]], [[Bank of Scotland]], [[B & Q]] and The Scottish Development Agency. The latter was rebranded by Tayburn to become Scottish Enterprise, and they also handled the privatisation of Scottish Electricity for Scottish Hydro-Electric, who, as [[Scottish and Southern Energy plc]], are still a client today. Tayburn was also the inaugural winner of The Scottish Design Consultancy of the Year Award in 1992.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s Tayburn became the only ever Scotland-based winner of Best Annual Report prize from the Stock Exchange for Grampian Holdings. They were also listed in the UK's Top Ten Design Consultancies for the first time.\n\nBy the late 1990s Tayburn had more business from outside Scotland than within it, which led to the establishment of their first international office in [[Istanbul]].\n\nAt the turn of the century, Tayburn was awarded 'Design Company of the Decade' by Trade magazine 'The Drum'.  In 2006, Simon Farrell joined Tayburn as Managing Director and Erick Davidson became Chairman.

However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/>\n\nThe rooms on the north and east sides of the third floor were accessed via the private staircase.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> Both were connected via a [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] at the top of the private staircase.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/>\n\nThe room on the south side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was accessed via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/>\n\nAbove the small family/chaplain's room on the third floor, was the servant's room with a corner fireplace and two windows on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floor, accessed via the main staircase.<ref name=\"Hugill60\"/><ref name=\"Emery108\"/> Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe.<ref name=\"Hugill60\"/><ref name=\"Emery109\">Emery, p.109</ref> There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.<ref name=\"Emery109\"/>\n\n==Heraldry==\nThe castle and chapel are adorned with [[heraldry|heraldic]] devices and shields of arms, providing information as to when the castle was constructed.\n\n===West fa\u00e7ade===\nAbove the main entrance on the western fa\u00e7ade of the castle, there are twenty shields of arms.

stone [[castle]] in the [[North Hylton]] area of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. Originally built from wood by the [[Baron Hylton|Hilton (later Hylton) family]] shortly after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in 1066, it was later rebuilt in stone in the late 14th to early 15th century.<ref name=\"Whittaker83\">Whittaker, p.83</ref> The castle underwent major changes to its interior and exterior in the 18th century and it remained the principal seat of the Hylton family until the death of the last Baron in 1746.<ref name=\"Fry\">Fry, p.246</ref> It was then [[Gothic architecture|Gothicised]] but neglected until 1812, when it was revitalised by a new owner. Standing empty again until the 1840s, it was briefly used as a school until it was purchased again in 1862. The site passed to a local coal company in the early 20th century and was taken over by the [[Sovereign state|state]] in 1950.\n\nOne of the castle's main features is the range of [[heraldry|heraldic]] devices found mainly on the west [[fa\u00e7ade]], which have been retained from the castle's original construction. They depict the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] belonging to local gentry and peers of the late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date of the castle's reconstruction from wood to stone.\n\nToday, the castle is owned by [[English Heritage]], a charity which manages the historical environment of England.

However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/>\n\nThe rooms on the north and east sides of the third floor were accessed via the private staircase.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/> Both were connected via a [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] at the top of the private staircase.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/><ref name=\"Hugill59\"/>\n\nThe room on the south side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was accessed via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.<ref name=\"Emery108\"/>\n\nAbove the small family/chaplain's room on the third floor, was the servant's room with a corner fireplace and two windows on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floor, accessed via the main staircase.<ref name=\"Hugill60\"/><ref name=\"Emery108\"/> Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe.<ref name=\"Hugill60\"/><ref name=\"Emery109\">Emery, p.109</ref> There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.<ref name=\"Emery109\"/>\n\n==Heraldry==\nThe castle and chapel are adorned with [[heraldry|heraldic]] devices and shields of arms, providing information as to when the castle was constructed.\n\n===West fa\u00e7ade===\nAbove the main entrance on the western fa\u00e7ade of the castle, there are twenty shields of arms.
