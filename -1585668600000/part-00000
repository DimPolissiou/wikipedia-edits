The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n==Geography==\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from {{convert|450|to|720|m|abbr=off}}.\n\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep [[Longmen Mountains]] in the north-west and in the west by the [[Qionglai Mountains]], the elevation of which exceeds {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} and includes Miao Jiling ({{convert|5364|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) and Xiling Snow Mountain ({{convert|5164|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a [[giant panda]] habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low [[Longquan Mountains]] and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]], an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\n\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and sits on the [[Chengdu Plain]]; the dominating terrain is plains. The [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture]] ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for {{convert|192|km}} from east to west and {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} south to north, administering {{convert|12390|km2}} of land. Neighbouring prefectures are [[Deyang]] (NE), [[Ziyang, Sichuan|Ziyang]] (SE), [[Meishan]] (S), [[Ya'an]] (SW), and the [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] (N). The urban area, with an elevation of {{convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, features a few rivers, three of them being the [[Jin River (Sichuan)|Jin]], [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu]], and [[Sha River]]s. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the [[Longquan Mountains]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109}}) and the Penzhong Hills ({{lang|zh|\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675}}); to the west lie the [[Qionglai Mountains]], which rise to {{convert|5364|m|abbr=on}} in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at {{convert|378|m|abbr=on}}, lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n===Climate===\nChengdu has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely warm with high [[relative humidity]] all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold [[Siberian anticyclone|Siberian winds]] in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|5.6|\u00b0C|1}}, and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"[[Three Furnaces]]\" cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Nanjing]], all which lie in the Yangtze basin.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5\n|script-title = zh:\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u91cd\u5e86\u3001\u6b66\u6c49\u3001\u5357\u4eac\u6709\"\u4e09\u5927\u706b\u7089\"\u4e4b\u79f0\uff1f\n|publisher = Guangzhou Popular Science News Net ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5e7f\u5dde\u79d1\u666e\u8d44\u8baf\u7f51}})\n| language = zh-hans\n|date = 12 September 2007\n|accessdate = 29 November 2010\n|url-status = dead\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5\n|archivedate = 12 November 2014\n|df = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around {{convert|25|\u00b0C}}, with afternoon highs sometimes reaching {{convert|33|\u00b0C}}; sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November).

In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\n\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).<ref>\"Man on a Mission\" by Stanley Crawford</ref>\n\nThe Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Pastor Wang Yi]]. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |title=Chinese pastor's wife accused of subversion, held in unknown location |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215213043/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=13 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |title=Members of unofficial Chinese church vow to keep meeting |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213082423/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=11 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |title=Minitrue: No Reports on Chengdu Church Crackdown \u2013 China Digital Times (CDT) |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164908/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From a photo of {{M|s|link=y}}.

Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda.

Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\n\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and sits on the [[Chengdu Plain]]; the dominating terrain is plains. The [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture]] ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for {{convert|192|km}} from east to west and {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} south to north, administering {{convert|12390|km2}} of land. Neighbouring prefectures are [[Deyang]] (NE), [[Ziyang, Sichuan|Ziyang]] (SE), [[Meishan]] (S), [[Ya'an]] (SW), and the [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] (N). The urban area, with an elevation of {{convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, features a few rivers, three of them being the [[Jin River (Sichuan)|Jin]], [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu]], and [[Sha River]]s. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the [[Longquan Mountains]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109}}) and the Penzhong Hills ({{lang|zh|\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675}}); to the west lie the [[Qionglai Mountains]], which rise to {{convert|5364|m|abbr=on}} in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at {{convert|378|m|abbr=on}}, lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n===Climate===\nChengdu has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely warm with high [[relative humidity]] all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold [[Siberian anticyclone|Siberian winds]] in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|5.6|\u00b0C|1}}, and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"[[Three Furnaces]]\" cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Nanjing]], all which lie in the Yangtze basin.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5\n|script-title = zh:\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u91cd\u5e86\u3001\u6b66\u6c49\u3001\u5357\u4eac\u6709\"\u4e09\u5927\u706b\u7089\"\u4e4b\u79f0\uff1f\n|publisher = Guangzhou Popular Science News Net ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5e7f\u5dde\u79d1\u666e\u8d44\u8baf\u7f51}})\n| language = zh-hans\n|date = 12 September 2007\n|accessdate = 29 November 2010\n|url-status = dead\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5\n|archivedate = 12 November 2014\n|df = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around {{convert|25|\u00b0C}}, with afternoon highs sometimes reaching {{convert|33|\u00b0C}}; sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is {{convert|16.27|\u00b0C|1}}, and extremes have ranged from {{convert|\u22124.6|\u00b0C|0}} to {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y

The city has been home to literary giants, such as [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], two masters of [[Fu (poetry)|Fu]], a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; [[Li Bai]] and [[Su Shi]], the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; [[Yang Shen'an]], a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Ba Jin]], two well-known modern writers. [[Chang Qu]], a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the [[Record of Hua Yang State]]. [[Zhao Chongzuo]], a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited [[Among the Flowers]], the first anthology of [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] in China's history. [[Meng Chang]], the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n===Fine art===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the [[Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school]] with other painters.

In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\n\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).<ref>\"Man on a Mission\" by Stanley Crawford</ref>\n\nThe Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Pastor Wang Yi]]. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |title=Chinese pastor's wife accused of subversion, held in unknown location |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215213043/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=13 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |title=Members of unofficial Chinese church vow to keep meeting |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213082423/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=11 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |title=Minitrue: No Reports on Chengdu Church Crackdown \u2013 China Digital Times (CDT) |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164908/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From a photo of {{M|s|link=y}}.

In addition to that, Montenegro obtained a second place in the prestigious \"Festimagico Infantil\" (\"Magic Children's Festival\") [[talent show]], which was held by [[Venevision]].\n\nBy 1986, Montenegro would embark in a [[fashion model|modeling]] career, making some [[television]] commercials and appearing on some [[Mail-order catalog|catalog]]s. He made three telenovelas and one film that year. One of the telenovelas he made that year was \"La Intrusa\", considered a classic by [[Latin American]] critics.\n\nIn 1987, Montenegro began exploring his singing abilities, as he was cast on three [[musical theater|musicals]]. He also became active in a national campaign against [[brain stroke]] that year.\n\n1988 was a year of firsts for Montenegro, as he debuted on [[radio]] with a [[talk show]] named \"Tren Fantasia\" (\"Fantasy Train\"), and also as a show host, on Radio Caracas Television's \"Festival Fantastico Infantil\" (\"Children's Fantastic Festival\"). Montenegro's popularity in Venezuela helped for the directors of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]'s annual \"[[Festival de la Calle 8]]\", a very popular festival among Hispanics, to invite him for the festival's 1989 version.\n\nThat same year, Montenegro participated in a television [[comedy]] show, a [[game show]], a mini-series and another [[soap opera]]. He was also discovered by [[Edgardo Diaz]], who saw the eleven-year-old actor participate alongside Menudo in \"Los Ultimos Heroes\", a soap opera based on Menudo's latest album, \"[[Los Ultimos Heroes]]\".\n\nIn 1990, Montenegro acted alongside [[Antonio Banderas]] in a film named [[Terranova (film)|Terranova]]. On December 10 of that year, Montenegro signed with Menudo, becoming the first [[Venezuela]]n and first [[South America]]n member of the band. He joined [[Mexico]]'s [[Adrian Olivares]], who had previously become the first non-[[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] member of Menudo.\n\nIn 1991 Montenegro left the group. He has never mentioned any specific reasons as to why he left, but by the time he did, he had already become a teen idol across Latin America and in [[Spain]], where he toured and had to schedule a special [[autograph]] and photo session with his [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]] fans before leaving the [[Europe]]an country.\n\nMontenegro spent two years in Venezuela after that, recording four telenovelas. In 1993 he was cast in telenovela ''Dulce Ilusi\u00f3n''. From 1994 to 1995, Montenegro left show business periodically, concentrating on getting his [[high school]] diploma and taking [[English language|English]] classes in the [[United States]].\n\nMontenegro returned to acting in 1996, by participating in \"Sol de Tentacion\". He participated in two television shows that year.\n\nBy 1997, Montenegro was a full-fledged member of the Venevision roster. He participated in two Venevision soap operas between then and 1998, including \"Samantha\", where he played a [[drug addict]]. That characterization earned him an award as Venezuela's \"Best young television actor\".\n\nIn 1999, Montenegro left acting to become a [[Radio producer|producer]], once again, on radio. He began to produce \"Tu Generacion\", a radio show geared towards Venezuelan [[Heavy Metal music]] fans. The show has remained on the air, but without Montenegro since the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2000, Montenegro resumed acting in television series ''Mis 3 hermanas''.\n\nIn 2002, Montenegro was in telenovela ''[[Juana la virgen]]''.\n\nIn 2003, Montenegro was in television series ''La Cuaima''.\n\nIn 2005, Montenegro was in television series ''Due\u00f1a y Se\u00f1ora'' in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 2006, Montenegro was in television series ''Voltea pa' que te enamores''.\n\nJonathan Montenegro later embarked on a solo singing career, releasing a total of two [[CD]]'s.

The [[Boston Celtics]], top-seeded champions of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], top-seeded champions of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], four games to two in a best-of-seven series. This was Boston's first title since 1986 during the [[Larry Bird]] era and 17th overall.\n\n2008 marked the first time since {{nbafy|2000}} that the top seeds from both conferences met in the Finals and the first time since 2003 that any top seeded team played in the NBA finals. The Lakers appeared in the Finals for the first time since {{nbafy|2004}} and a record 29th time overall. The Celtics appeared in the Finals for the first time since {{nbafy|1987}} and second-best 20th time overall.\n\nThe 2008 Boston Celtics championship team was famously led by the organization's \"Big 3\" in [[Paul Pierce]], [[Ray Allen]], and [[Kevin Garnett]]. Prior to acquiring Allen from the Seattle SuperSonics and Garnett from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a blockbuster 7-to-1 player trade, Boston had won just 24 of its 82 games in the 2006-07 NBA regular season. The formation of the All-Star trifecta in the summer of 2007 positioned the new-look Celtics as a popular favorite to win the 2008 NBA Finals.\n\nGoing into the series, the Celtics had won the most championships of all-time with 16, and the Lakers were second with 14. The two most successful teams in NBA history looked to renew a longstanding [[Lakers\u2013Celtics rivalry|rivalry]] 21 years after their last Finals meeting in 1987. They narrowly missed meeting each other in [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]], when the Lakers advanced to the Finals, but the Celtics, who led 2\u20131 in the Conference Finals, eventually fell to the favored [[New Jersey Nets]] 4\u20132. This was the 11th time the teams met in the championship round; the Celtics won eight of their previous ten Finals meetings against the Lakers, winning in {{nbafy|1959}}, {{nbafy|1962}}, {{nbafy|1963}}, {{nbafy|1965}}, {{nbafy|1966}}, {{nbafy|1968}}, {{nbafy|1969}} and {{nbafy|1984}}\u2014the Lakers won in {{nbafy|1985}} and {{nbafy|1987}}.\n\nThe Celtics' 66\u201316 record gave them [[Home advantage|home court advantage]] over Los Angeles (57\u201325). This was the first time since {{nbafy|1997}}, when the [[Chicago Bulls]] beat the [[Utah Jazz]] for the championship, and the only time in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]] that an [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] team had the home court advantage. This was also the first NBA Finals series since 1998 to not feature [[Tim Duncan]] (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007) or [[Shaquille O'Neal]] (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006).\n\nRodd Houston narrated the Boston Celtics' championship season documentary on [[NBA Entertainment]].

Over the next 20 years the Celtics would suffer through several lean years, not making the playoffs in nine of those years. Following the departures of [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] the Celtics suffered through several tragedies such as the passing of [[Reggie Lewis]] in 1993, a franchise-worst 15-win [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], the ill-fated hiring of head coach [[Rick Pitino]], and the deaths of franchise patriarch [[Red Auerbach]] and former player [[Dennis Johnson]] that culminated in a 24-win [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], highlighted by a franchise-worst 18 straight losses.\n\nThe 2007 off-season saw Celtics GM [[Danny Ainge]] acquire [[Ray Allen]] and [[Kevin Garnett]] to join franchise star [[Paul Pierce]]. This new formation was widely regarded as the most talent the Boston Celtics team possessed since the duo of [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Paul Pierce]] graced the floor of the TD Garden in the early 2000s. The newly formed 'Big Three' led the Celtics to a dramatic 42-game turnaround, finishing with 66 wins. In the playoffs the Celtics were pushed to the brink by the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and despite not winning on the road, they managed to prevail in a pair of Game 7s on their [[TD Garden|home court]]. The Celtics would finally break their road woes in a six-game win against the perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse [[Detroit Pistons]], earning their first finals berth since 1987.\n\nAfter losing to the Pistons in the [[2004 NBA Finals]] despite a talent-laden roster, [[Phil Jackson]] abruptly retired. Soon after the Lakers decided to rebuild by trading away [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Lamar Odom]], [[Caron Butler]] and [[Brian Grant]]. The [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] saw the Lakers miss the playoffs for only the fifth time in team history. Even though he had written a book called ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', going as far as calling [[Kobe Bryant]] \"uncoachable\", Jackson returned to the Lakers for the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. Jackson and Bryant would patch their differences, but after a pair of first-round exits, Bryant demanded, but later retracted, a trade in the off-season.\n\nThe Lakers' 2007\u201308 season saw the team win 57 games, along the way adding [[Spain|Spanish]] forward [[Pau Gasol]] in mid-season while [[Andrew Bynum]] was recovering from a mid-season knee injury. The Lakers eliminated the [[Denver Nuggets]] 4\u20130, then the [[Utah Jazz]] 4\u20132 and then dethroned the erstwhile defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]] 4\u20131 in the conference finals, making their 29th NBA Finals appearance.\n\n===2008 NBA Playoffs===\n{{main|2008 NBA Playoffs}}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=top\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] ([[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion) !! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|[[Boston Celtics]] ([[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion)\n|-\n|align=right|{{2007\u201308 NBA West standings|team=LAL}}1st seed in the West, 3rd best league record\n!colspan=2|[[2007\u201308 NBA season|Regular season]]\n|{{2007\u201308 NBA East standings|team=BOS}}1st seed in the East, best league record\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (8) [[Denver Nuggets]], 4\u20130\n!colspan=2|First Round\n|Defeated the (8) [[Atlanta Hawks]], 4\u20133\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (4) [[Utah Jazz]], 4\u20132\n!colspan=2|Conference Semifinals\n|Defeated the (4) [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], 4\u20133\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (3) [[San Antonio Spurs]], 4\u20131\n!colspan=2|Conference Finals\n|Defeated the (2) [[Detroit Pistons]], 4\u20132\n|}\n\n===Regular season series===\nThe [[Boston Celtics]] won both games in the regular season series:\n{{basketballbox\n | bg=#fff\n | date = November 23, 2007\n | report = {{NBA Recap|2007|1123|id=LALBOS}}\n | team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=94\n | team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]] |score2=107'''\n | place = [[TD Garden|TD Banknorth Garden]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n | TV = [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]], [[CSN New England|CSN]]\n }}\n{{basketballbox\n | date = December 30, 2007\n | report = {{NBA Recap|2007|1230|id=BOSLAL}}\n | team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]] |score1=110'''\n | team2 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score2=91\n | place = [[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]\n | TV = [[NBA TV]]\n}}\n\n==Game summaries==\n{{see also|Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry#2008 NBA Finals}}\nAll times listed below are [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]].<ref name=schedule>{{cite news |title=2008 NBA Finals Schedule |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3418220 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2008-05-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602012624/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3418220| archivedate= 2 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #eee\n | date = June 5\n | time = 9:00 pm\n | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20080605/LALBOS/recap.html Recap]<br />{{YouTube|_oQfMYu3fAk|Video highlights}}\n | team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]]\n | score1 = 88\n | score2 = '''98'''\n | team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]'''\n | Q1 = 21\u2013'''23''' | Q2 = '''30'''\u201323 | Q3 = 22\u2013'''31''' | Q4 = 15\u2013'''21'''\n | points1 = [[Kobe Bryant]] 24\n | points2 = [[Kevin Garnett]] 24\n | rebounds1 = [[Pau Gasol]] 8\n | rebounds2 = [[Kevin Garnett]] 13\n | assist1 = [[Kobe Bryant|Bryant]], [[Derek Fisher|Fisher]] 6 each\n | assist2 = [[Rajon Rondo]] 7\n | otherstat1 = '''FT:''' [[Kobe Bryant]] 6/6 | otherstat2 = '''Stls:''' [[James Posey]] 2\n | place = [[TD Garden|TD Banknorth Garden]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n | attendance = 18,624\n | referee =<br />\n* No. 27 [[Dick Bavetta]]\n* No. 48 [[Scott Foster (referee)|Scott Foster]]\n* No. 32 [[Eddie F.

Despite what Pierce's reaction suggested was a highly debilitating injury, he returned to action minutes later to raucous cheering from the crowd.

Maintaining a lead of more than 25 points, the Celtics' Big Three performed phenomenally, while the whole team smothered the Lakers' offense with their tight defense. Boston dominated in numerous statistical categories, including rebounds (48\u201329, with a 14\u20132 disparity in offensive boards), turnovers (7\u201319), steals (18\u20134), assists (33\u201316) and blocks (4\u20130). Five Celtics finished in double figures. [[Ray Allen]] hit seven three-pointers to tie what was then the Finals record (which he subsequently broke during the [[2010 NBA Finals]] against the Lakers during game two), [[Rajon Rondo]] had an all-around spectacular performance (21 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, 6 steals), the Celtics only turned the ball over seven times and set a Finals record with 18 steals, and every Boston player who saw action scored.<ref name=globe>{{cite news|title=NBA Basketball|url=http://boston.stats.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2008061702&home=2&vis=13&meta=true|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130208191901/http://boston.stats.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2008061702&home=2&vis=13&meta=true|archive-date=February 8, 2013|date=June 18, 2008|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2008-06-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe 39-point margin of victory was the largest ever in an NBA championship-clinching game, breaking the old record of 33, also set by the Celtics over the Lakers in Game Five of the [[1965 NBA Finals]], 129\u201396.<ref name=\"cnnsi-2008\"/> This lead was close to the Finals point-spread record set in Game 3 in {{nbafy|1998}} where a [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[Chicago Bulls]] team beat the [[Utah Jazz]] by 42 points, 96\u201354.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25227077/|title=Largest margins of victory in NBA Finals|publisher=NBCSports.com|accessdate=19 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205181257/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25227077/|archive-date=5 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetfm.com/srn/finals98.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605185029/http://www.internetfm.com/srn/finals98.htm|url-status=dead|title=1998 NBA Finals<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/nba/longterm/1998/finals/articles/nba8.htm|title=Bulls Roll to Game 3 Victory, 96\u201354|date=June 8, 1998|first=Ric|last=Bucher|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref> The Celtics also improved their overall record against the Lakers to 9\u20132 in Finals meetings, beating them in the Finals for the first time since [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]].<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nThis was the Celtics' 17th championship, their first since {{nbafy|1986}}, extending their [[List of NBA champions|record]] for most NBA championships won by a single team.

The Celtics won 62 games, but the absence of Garnett affected the team as they were eliminated in seven games by the [[Orlando Magic]] in the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|Eastern Conference Semifinals]].\n\nThe Lakers rebounded to win 65 games in the aforementioned season, then proceeded to [[2009 NBA Finals|win the NBA title]] in five games over the Magic. Even though another mid-season injury to [[Andrew Bynum]] threatened their title drive, he did come back late in the season. The Lakers became the first team since the [[1988-89 Detroit Pistons season|1988\u201389 Pistons]] to win the NBA Finals after losing it in the previous year.\n\nBoth teams would eventually meet again in [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]] where the Lakers defeated the Celtics in seven games.\n\nThe Celtics' 17th championship raised the total of [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] championships in [[Boston]] to 32, and it continued a string of championships for the city this decade. The [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New England Patriots]] won the [[Super Bowl]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2003]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2004]], and nearly won a fourth on [[Super Bowl XLII]], only to have a perfect season denied by the [[New York Giants]] four months earlier. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Boston Red Sox]] won their second [[World Series]] title of the decade [[2007 World Series|eight months earlier]], adding their total to seven. With the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]] winning the [[2011 Stanley Cup Finals]], the city of Boston became the first city to win championships in all four major sports in a seven-year span. The city's total title tally now stands at 37.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry]]\n* [[Sports-related curses#Curse of Len Bias|Curse of Len Bias]] \u2013 the alleged curse that had kept the Celtics from winning the NBA Finals since 1986, which was broken in this series.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|2008 NBA Finals}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2008/ |title=Official site |accessdate=2008-05-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501235742/http://www.nba.com/finals2008/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 }}\n\n{{NBA Finals}}\n{{Boston Celtics 2007\u201308 NBA champions}}\n{{Boston Celtics}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers}}\n{{2007\u201308 NBA season by team}}\n{{NBA on ABC}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball Association Finals]]\n[[Category:2007\u201308 NBA season|Finals]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Lakers games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Boston Celtics games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Boston]]\n[[Category:2008 in Boston]]\n[[Category:2008 in sports in California|NBA Finals]]\n[[Category:2008 in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:June 2008 sports events in the United States]]\n[[Category:2008 in sports in Massachusetts|NBA Finals]]\n\n[[it:NBA Playoffs 2008#NBA Finals: Boston Celtics - Los Angeles Lakers]]\n", "text_old": "{{NBA Finals summary\n| image = 2008 NBA Finals.png\n| caption =\n| league = NBA\n| year = 2008\n| runnerup = [[Los Angeles Lakers]]\n| runnerup_coach = [[Phil Jackson]]\n| runnerup_games = 2\n| champion = [[Boston Celtics]]\n| champion_coach = [[Doc Rivers]]\n| champion_games = 4\n| date=June 5\u201317\n| MVP = [[Paul Pierce]]<br>(Boston Celtics)\n| television = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n| announcers = [[Mike Breen]], [[Jeff Van Gundy]] and [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]]\n| HOFers = '''Celtics:'''<br>[[Ray Allen]] (2018)<br>'''Coaches:'''<br>Phil Jackson (2007)<br>[[Tex Winter]] (2011)<br>'''Officials:'''<br>[[Dick Bavetta]] (2015)\n| radio_network = [[NBA on ESPN Radio|ESPN]]\n| radio_announcers = [[Mike Tirico]], [[Jim Durham]] (Game 4) and [[Hubie Brown]]\n| referees_1 = [[Dick Bavetta]], [[Scott Foster (referee)|Scott Foster]], [[Eddie F.

The [[Boston Celtics]], top-seeded champions of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], top-seeded champions of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], four games to two in a best-of-seven series. This was Boston's first title since 1986 during the [[Larry Bird]] era and 17th overall.\n\n2008 marked the first time since {{nbafy|2000}} that the top seeds from both conferences met in the Finals and the first time since 2003 that any top seeded team played in the NBA finals. The Lakers appeared in the Finals for the first time since {{nbafy|2004}} and a record 29th time overall. The Celtics appeared in the Finals for the first time since {{nbafy|1987}} and second-best 20th time overall.\n\nThe 2008 Boston Celtics championship team was famously led by the organization's \"Big 3\" in [[Paul Pierce]], [[Ray Allen]], and [[Kevin Garnett]]. Prior to acquiring Allen from the Seattle SuperSonics and Garnett from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a blockbuster 7-to-1 player trade, Boston had won just 24 of its 82 games in the 2006-07 NBA regular season. The formation of the All-Star trifecta in the summer of 2007 positioned the new-look Celtics as a popular favorite to win the 2008 NBA Finals.\n\nGoing into the series, the Celtics had won the most championships of all-time with 16, and the Lakers were second with 14. The two most successful teams in NBA history looked to renew a longstanding [[Lakers\u2013Celtics rivalry|rivalry]] 21 years after their last Finals meeting in 1987. They narrowly missed meeting each other in [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]], when the Lakers advanced to the Finals, but the Celtics, who led 2\u20131 in the Conference Finals, eventually fell to the favored [[New Jersey Nets]] 4\u20132. This was the 11th time the teams met in the championship round; the Celtics won eight of their previous ten Finals meetings against the Lakers, winning in {{nbafy|1959}}, {{nbafy|1962}}, {{nbafy|1963}}, {{nbafy|1965}}, {{nbafy|1966}}, {{nbafy|1968}}, {{nbafy|1969}} and {{nbafy|1984}}\u2014the Lakers won in {{nbafy|1985}} and {{nbafy|1987}}.\n\nThe Celtics' 66\u201316 record gave them [[Home advantage|home court advantage]] over Los Angeles (57\u201325). This was the first time since {{nbafy|1997}}, when the [[Chicago Bulls]] beat the [[Utah Jazz]] for the championship, and the only time in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]] that an [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] team had the home court advantage. This was also the first NBA Finals series since 1998 to not feature [[Tim Duncan]] (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007) or [[Shaquille O'Neal]] (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006).\n\nRodd Houston narrated the Boston Celtics' championship season documentary on [[NBA Entertainment]]. The made-for-TV version of this documentary is narrated by [[Kevin Harlan]].\n\n==Series summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Game !! Date !! Away Team !! Result !!

Over the next 20 years the Celtics would suffer through several lean years, not making the playoffs in nine of those years. Following the departures of [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] the Celtics suffered through several tragedies such as the passing of [[Reggie Lewis]] in 1993, a franchise-worst 15-win [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], the ill-fated hiring of head coach [[Rick Pitino]], and the deaths of franchise patriarch [[Red Auerbach]] and former player [[Dennis Johnson]] that culminated in a 24-win [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], highlighted by a franchise-worst 18 straight losses.\n\nThe 2007 off-season saw Celtics GM [[Danny Ainge]] acquire [[Ray Allen]] and [[Kevin Garnett]] to join franchise star [[Paul Pierce]]. This new formation was widely regarded as the most talent the Boston Celtics team possessed since the duo of [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Paul Pierce]] graced the floor of the TD Garden in the early 2000's. The newly formed 'Big Three' led the Celtics to a dramatic 42-game turnaround, finishing with 66 wins. In the playoffs the Celtics were pushed to the brink by the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and despite not winning on the road, they managed to prevail in a pair of Game 7s on their [[TD Garden|home court]]. The Celtics would finally break their road woes in a six-game win against the perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse [[Detroit Pistons]], earning their first finals berth since 1987.\n\nAfter losing to the Pistons in the [[2004 NBA Finals]] despite a talent-laden roster, [[Phil Jackson]] abruptly retired. Soon after the Lakers decided to rebuild by trading away [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Lamar Odom]], [[Caron Butler]] and [[Brian Grant]]. The [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] saw the Lakers miss the playoffs for only the fifth time in team history. Even though he had written a book called ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', going as far as calling [[Kobe Bryant]] \"uncoachable\", Jackson returned to the Lakers for the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. Jackson and Bryant would patch their differences, but after a pair of first-round exits, Bryant demanded, but later retracted, a trade in the off-season.\n\nThe Lakers' 2007\u201308 season saw the team win 57 games, along the way adding [[Spain|Spanish]] forward [[Pau Gasol]] in mid-season while [[Andrew Bynum]] was recovering from a mid-season knee injury. The Lakers eliminated the [[Denver Nuggets]] 4\u20130, then the [[Utah Jazz]] 4\u20132 and then dethroned the erstwhile defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]] 4\u20131 in the conference finals, making their 29th NBA Finals appearance.\n\n===2008 NBA Playoffs===\n{{main|2008 NBA Playoffs}}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=top\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] ([[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion) !! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|[[Boston Celtics]] ([[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion)\n|-\n|align=right|{{2007\u201308 NBA West standings|team=LAL}}1st seed in the West, 3rd best league record\n!colspan=2|[[2007\u201308 NBA season|Regular season]]\n|{{2007\u201308 NBA East standings|team=BOS}}1st seed in the East, best league record\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (8) [[Denver Nuggets]], 4\u20130\n!colspan=2|First Round\n|Defeated the (8) [[Atlanta Hawks]], 4\u20133\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (4) [[Utah Jazz]], 4\u20132\n!colspan=2|Conference Semifinals\n|Defeated the (4) [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], 4\u20133\n|-\n|align=right|Defeated the (3) [[San Antonio Spurs]], 4\u20131\n!colspan=2|Conference Finals\n|Defeated the (2) [[Detroit Pistons]], 4\u20132\n|}\n\n===Regular season series===\nThe [[Boston Celtics]] won both games in the regular season series:\n{{basketballbox\n | bg=#fff\n | date = November 23, 2007\n | report = {{NBA Recap|2007|1123|id=LALBOS}}\n | team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=94\n | team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]] |score2=107'''\n | place = [[TD Garden|TD Banknorth Garden]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n | TV = [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]], [[CSN New England|CSN]]\n }}\n{{basketballbox\n | date = December 30, 2007\n | report = {{NBA Recap|2007|1230|id=BOSLAL}}\n | team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]] |score1=110'''\n | team2 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score2=91\n | place = [[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]\n | TV = [[NBA TV]]\n}}\n\n==Game summaries==\n{{see also|Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry#2008 NBA Finals}}\nAll times listed below are [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]].<ref name=schedule>{{cite news |title=2008 NBA Finals Schedule |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3418220 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2008-05-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602012624/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3418220| archivedate= 2 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #eee\n | date = June 5\n | time = 9:00 pm\n | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20080605/LALBOS/recap.html Recap]<br />{{YouTube|_oQfMYu3fAk|Video highlights}}\n | team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]]\n | score1 = 88\n | score2 = '''98'''\n | team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]'''\n | Q1 = 21\u2013'''23''' | Q2 = '''30'''\u201323 | Q3 = 22\u2013'''31''' | Q4 = 15\u2013'''21'''\n | points1 = [[Kobe Bryant]] 24\n | points2 = [[Kevin Garnett]] 24\n | rebounds1 = [[Pau Gasol]] 8\n | rebounds2 = [[Kevin Garnett]] 13\n | assist1 = [[Kobe Bryant|Bryant]], [[Derek Fisher|Fisher]] 6 each\n | assist2 = [[Rajon Rondo]] 7\n | otherstat1 = '''FT:''' [[Kobe Bryant]] 6/6 | otherstat2 = '''Stls:''' [[James Posey]] 2\n | place = [[TD Garden|TD Banknorth Garden]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n | attendance = 18,624\n | referee =<br />\n* No. 27 [[Dick Bavetta]]\n* No. 48 [[Scott Foster (referee)|Scott Foster]]\n* No. 32 [[Eddie F.

[[Kobe Bryant]] had 24 points.\n\t\nPierce apparently injured his knee by falling awkwardly on Kendrick Perkins' leg, and was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Despite what Pierce's reaction suggested was a highly debilitating injury, he returned to action minutes later to raucous cheering from the crowd. It was later noted that Pierce just had to use the bathroom. He soon hit two three-pointers on consecutive offensive possessions that gave Boston the lead for good and finished with 22 points.

[[Paul Pierce]] and [[James Posey]] then closed out the game with two free throws each. The Lakers had a chance to cut into Boston's four-point lead with 14 seconds left, but the ball failed to get into the hands of [[Kobe Bryant]], resulting in a shot by [[Sa\u0161a Vuja\u010di\u0107]] that was blocked by Pierce.

Then days after the [[2009 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] [[Kevin Garnett]] injured his right knee, and was lost for the season. The Celtics won 62 games, but the absence of Garnett affected the team as they were eliminated in seven games by the [[Orlando Magic]] in the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|Eastern Conference Semifinals]].\n\nThe Lakers rebounded to win 65 games in the aforementioned season, then proceeded to [[2009 NBA Finals|win the NBA title]] in five games over the Magic. Even though another mid-season injury to [[Andrew Bynum]] threatened their title drive, he did come back late in the season. The Lakers became the first team since the [[1988-89 Detroit Pistons season|1988\u201389 Pistons]] to win the NBA Finals after losing it in the previous year.\n\nBoth teams would eventually meet again in [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]] where the Lakers defeated the Celtics in seven games.\n\nThe Celtics' 17th championship raised the total of [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] championships in [[Boston]] to 32, and it continued a string of championships for the city this decade. The [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New England Patriots]] won the [[Super Bowl]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2003]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2004]], and nearly won a fourth on [[Super Bowl XLII]], only to have a perfect season denied by the [[New York Giants]] four months earlier. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Boston Red Sox]] won their second [[World Series]] title of the decade [[2007 World Series|eight months earlier]], adding their total to seven. With the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]] winning the [[2011 Stanley Cup Finals]], the city of Boston became the first city to win championships in all four major sports in a seven-year span. The city's total title tally now stands at 37.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry]]\n* [[Sports-related curses#Curse of Len Bias|Curse of Len Bias]] \u2013 the alleged curse that had kept the Celtics from winning the NBA Finals since 1986, which was broken in this series.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|2008 NBA Finals}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2008/ |title=Official site |accessdate=2008-05-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501235742/http://www.nba.com/finals2008/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 }}\n\n{{NBA Finals}}\n{{Boston Celtics 2007\u201308 NBA champions}}\n{{Boston Celtics}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers}}\n{{2007\u201308 NBA season by team}}\n{{NBA on ABC}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball Association Finals]]\n[[Category:2007\u201308 NBA season|Finals]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Lakers games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Boston Celtics games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Boston]]\n[[Category:2008 in Boston]]\n[[Category:2008 in sports in California|NBA Finals]]\n[[Category:2008 in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:June 2008 sports events in the United States]]\n[[Category:2008 in sports in Massachusetts|NBA Finals]]\n\n[[it:NBA Playoffs 2008#NBA Finals: Boston Celtics - Los Angeles Lakers]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_NBA_Finals"}

The '''steelhead''' (sometimes called \"steelhead trout\") is an [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] (sea-run) form of the '''coastal rainbow trout''' {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}} or [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} that usually returns to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Great Lakes]] and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.\n\nAdult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between {{convert|1|and|5|lb|1|abbr=on}}, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Coloration varies widely based on [[subspecies]], forms and [[habitat]]. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the [[lateral line]], from [[gill]]s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.\n\nWild-caught and [[Fish hatchery|hatchery]]-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), [[Southern Europe]], Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as [[whirling disease]]), or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout is included in the [[List of globally invasive species|list of the top 100 globally invasive species]]. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created [[Recreational fishing|sport fisheries]] such as the Great Lakes and [[Wyoming]]'s [[Firehole River]].\n\nSome local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, [[distinct population segment]]s, are listed as either [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The steelhead is the official [[state fish]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/symbols/pages/default.aspx |title=Symbols of Washington State |publisher=Washington State Legislature |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref><!-- note web site specifies Salmo gairdnerii, just to further confuse matters -->\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the rainbow trout is {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}}.<ref name=Behnke2002-67>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |others=Tomelleri, Joseph R.

Stock rainbow trout of ages 1, 2, and 4 years had their heart and brain mitochondria isolated and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The tissues showed an overall similar percentage of total phospholipids but differed in the types and proportions of phospholipids. With age, the heart showed more unsaturated phospholipids, which are more susceptible to peroxidation, and thus, damage. The brain mitochondria of rainbow trout show decreased levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] and a lower peroxidation index, suggesting a lower susceptibility of damage by oxidative stress and a different reaction to growth compared to heart mitochondria. During the trout development into an adult, a time of intense growth, the mitochondrial membranes composition and fluidity changes, which can cause defects in the [[electron transport chain]]. These defects combined with altered machinery repair and reactive oxygen species may cause more detrimental effects to the mitochondria in the fish as it matures. {{clear}}\n\n==Feeding==\nRainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as [[Piscivore|piscivorous]] or aggressive as brown trout or [[Salvelinus|chars]]. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, [[crayfish]], shrimp, and other [[crustacean]]s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become [[plankton]]ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, [[mountain whitefish]] and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, [[squid]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |title=BC Fish Facts-Steelhead |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Fisheries |accessdate=2013-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718071122/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Steelhead Global Range Map.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Map of native range of anadromous form-steelhead|Native range of steelhead, the anadromous form of ''O. mykiss'']]\nThe native range of {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}} is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the [[Aleutian Islands]], throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico.

The '''steelhead''' (sometimes called \"steelhead trout\") is an [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] (sea-run) form of the '''coastal rainbow trout''' {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}} or [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} that usually returns to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Great Lakes]] and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.\n\nAdult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between {{convert|1|and|5|lb|1|abbr=on}}, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Coloration varies widely based on [[subspecies]], forms and [[habitat]]. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the [[lateral line]], from [[gill]]s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.\n\nWild-caught and [[Fish hatchery|hatchery]]-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), [[Southern Europe]], Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as [[whirling disease]]), or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout is included in the [[List of globally invasive species|list of the top 100 globally invasive species]]. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created [[Recreational fishing|sport fisheries]] such as the Great Lakes and [[Wyoming]]'s [[Firehole River]].\n\nSome local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, [[distinct population segment]]s, are listed as either [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]].

Stock rainbow trout of ages 1, 2, and 4 years had their heart and brain mitochondria isolated and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The tissues showed an overall similar percentage of total phospholipids but differed in the types and proportions of phospholipids. With age, the heart showed more unsaturated phospholipids, which are more susceptible to peroxidation, and thus, damage. The brain mitochondria of rainbow trout show decreased levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] and a lower peroxidation index, suggesting a lower susceptibility of damage by oxidative stress and a different reaction to growth compared to heart mitochondria. During the trout development into an adult, a time of intense growth, the mitochondrial membranes composition and fluidity changes, which can cause defects in the [[electron transport chain]]. These defects combined with altered machinery repair and reactive oxygen species may cause more detrimental effects to the mitochondria in the fish as it matures. {{clear}}\n\n==Feeding==\nRainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as [[Piscivore|piscivorous]] or aggressive as brown trout or [[Salvelinus|chars]]. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, [[crayfish]], shrimp, and other [[crustacean]]s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become [[plankton]]ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, [[mountain whitefish]] and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, [[squid]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |title=BC Fish Facts-Steelhead |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Fisheries |accessdate=2013-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718071122/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Steelhead Global Range Map.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Map of native range of anadromous form-steelhead|Native range of steelhead, the anadromous form of ''O. mykiss'']]\nThe native range of {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}} is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the [[Aleutian Islands]], throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico.

Once the chemicals have dissipated, native trout are released into the river. Another method is to use [[electrofishing]] which enable the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re-located. This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since. They are hoping to re-establish native brook trout in at least some of the 2100-mile river system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/native-trout-are-returning-to-americas-rivers-160317057/?no-ist|title=Native Trout Are Returning to America's Rivers|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> Neither method of control is 100% effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species.\n\n===Steelhead declines===\n[[File:Zymoetz (Copper) River Steelhead.jpg|thumb|A large Steelhead caught on the [[Zymoetz River|Zymoetz (Copper) River]] in British Columbia]]\n{{see also|Steelhead and salmon distinct population segments|Conservation status of British Columbia salmonids}}\nSteelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes.
