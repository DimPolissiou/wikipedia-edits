Wesley attempts to speak to her to see if Fred is still there but Illyria states Fred is just the \"shell\" she's inhabiting. She then throws him across the room and says that if humans are in charge, she has a lot of work to do. Meanwhile, Angel and Spike fly back home, frustrated and disconsolate. However, Angel believes that since the body houses the soul, there is still hope for Fred. Meanwhile, Gunn and Harmony have Knox tied up in Angel's office. When Wesley arrives, they tell him that Knox was involved with what happened to Fred. Wesley then announces that Fred is dead.\n\nAngel and Spike return from England and Wesley suggests that Willow could help them, but in the meantime, they have to keep Illyria contained. However, at that moment, Illyria bursts into Angel's office, knocks Harmony out and takes Knox to the lab as he is her Qwa'ha Xahn, her guide in this world. Angel calls Giles to find Willow, but Giles does not trust Wolfram & Hart and hangs up on him. Harmony then arrives and informs the gang of Illyria's presence. They try to stop Illyria and Knox from leaving the building, but she slows down time to escape.\n\nAfterwards, speaking with Spike, Angel vows he will not lose Fred like he did with Cordelia. In the science lab, Wesley smashes the sarcophagus and takes a crystal from it. Harmony finds Knox's cell phone and Wesley discovers that he has three missed calls from Dr. Sparrow, whom Gunn is questioning. Gunn begs Sparrow to take back the legal knowledge in exchange for Fred, but Sparrow explains Fred's soul was destroyed in resurrecting Illyria. Wesley arrives, having overheard their conversation and knocks out Sparrow and stabs Gunn with a scalpel, as punishment for his part in Fred's death.\n\nAs Gunn recovers in the hospital, Angel asks Wesley to put aside his feelings to focus on dealing with Illyria. The team discovers that Illyria is trying to open a portal to her temple which is entombed with an army that has been waiting for her return. Knox finishes performing a spell to open the gateway for Illyria, just as Angel, Spike, and Wesley arrive. Knox tells them that they can't win this battle, but Angel offers to have mercy on him if he surrenders. However, Wesley shoots Knox. The gang fight Illyria, who beats them easily until Angel pulls out the crystal Wesley grabbed from the sarcophagus, which makes him unaffected by Illyria's time-altering powers. The portal opens and Illyria runs to her temple, followed by Wesley. However, her army is dead and her temple has been destroyed. Defeated, she returns with Wesley to the gang.\n\nBack in Angel's office, Angel says that they need to close the portal to make sure that Illyria does not try to raise another army. Spike decides to stay in L.A., since that is what Fred would have wanted. While Wesley packs up Fred's office, Illyria finds him. She explains to Wesley that there are still fragments of Fred inside her. Using Fred's voice, she repeats to him Fred's last words, \"Wesley, why can't I stay?\", which nearly causes him to break down, and she asks him to stay as she is stuck in this world and needs a guide. Wesley agrees because she looks like Fred but makes her promise not to kill anymore. She asks him if there is anything in this life but grief. Wesley replies by speaking of love and hope. Illyria asks him if that is enough to live on, but he can't answer her.\n\nThe last scene is the whole team mourning over the death of Fred and a flashback to Texas, Fred packs up her car, says goodbye to her parents, and heads to L.A.\n\n==Production details==\n===Acting===\nWhile writing the episode \"[[A Hole in the World]]\", [[Joss Whedon]] thought about using the character of [[Rupert Giles]] in the Deeper Well scene, but it would have been too expensive to fly in [[Anthony Stewart Head]] to guest star.<ref name=\"DVDReview\">{{Citation|first=Kristy |last=Bratton |accessdate=2007-10-24 |title=ANGEL Season Five DVD Collection REVIEW |url=http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts5/S5dvdReview1.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020164640/http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts5/S5dvdReview1.html |archivedate=2007-10-20 }}</ref> In this episode Angel instead speaks to Giles over the phone.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Angel (TV series)#Shells|Shells}}\n* {{imdb episode|0512896|Shells}}\n* {{tv.com episode|angel/shells-276673|Shells}}\n\n\n{{Angel episodes}}\n\n[[Category:Angel (season 5) episodes]]\n[[Category:2004 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes set in Texas]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Shells (''Angel'')}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|Television|date=June 2011}}\n{{original research|date=June 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2011}}\n{{all plot|date=June 2011}}\n}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Shells\n| series       = Angel\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 5\n| episode      = 16\n| airdate      = March 3, 2004\n| production   = 5ADH16\n| writer       = Steven S.

The series revolves around Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), an immature but talented [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective in [[Brooklyn]]'s fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The rest of the cast features [[Stephanie Beatriz]] as Rosa Diaz, [[Terry Crews]] as Terry Jeffords, [[Melissa Fumero]] as Amy Santiago, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Charles Boyle, [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Gina Linetti, [[Dirk Blocker]] as Michael Hitchcock, and [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Norm Scully.\n\nProduced as a [[single-camera]] comedy, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox canceled the series after five seasons. The following day, [[NBC]] picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on January 10, 2019.

The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the stoic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe only funny characters in the show are hitchcock and terry detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.

The series revolves around Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), an immature but talented [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective in [[Brooklyn]]'s fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The rest of the cast features [[Stephanie Beatriz]] as Rosa Diaz, [[Terry Crews]] as Terry Jeffords, [[Melissa Fumero]] as Amy Santiago, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Charles Boyle, [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Gina Linetti, [[Dirk Blocker]] as Michael Hitchcock, and [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Norm Scully.\n\nProduced as a [[single-camera]] comedy, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox canceled the series after five seasons. The following day, [[NBC]] picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on January 10, 2019. On February 27, NBC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on February 6, 2020. The series was renewed for an eighth season in November 2019, ahead of the premiere of its seventh season.\n\nThe series has been acclaimed by critics for its cast, especially Samberg, Beatriz, Fumero, and Braugher. It has won two [[Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. Samberg has won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy]], while Braugher has been nominated for three consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] and has won two [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. The series has also received particular praise for its portrayal of serious issues whilst retaining a sense of humor. For its portrayal of [[LGBTQ+]] people, the series won a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Comedy Series. <!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the fictional 99th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] in [[Brooklyn]], ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the stoic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.
