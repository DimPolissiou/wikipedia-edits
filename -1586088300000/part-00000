In the 1862 the Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum that would not only serve as an office but also could be used to house, preserve and display the collections.\n\nThe Museum was officially opened in 1868 and popularly known as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building) or sometimes called ''Gedung Arca'' (The house of Statues). It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871.

The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council).

The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948.

Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the [[champion]] of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. [[David]], bringing food for his elder brothers on the battlefield, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. \"The Philistine cursed David by his gods\", but David replies: \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.\"\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]\". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, \"I am the son of your servant [[Jesse]] the [[Bethlehem]]ite.\"\n\n===Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative===\nThe [[Books of Samuel]], together with the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the [[Deuteronomistic history]]. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King [[Josiah]] (late 7th century BCE) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century BCE), with further revisions in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn6}}{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10\u201311}} Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=262 fn62}} The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=259-260 fn58}} \n:''Original story''\n*The Israelites and Philistines face each other; Goliath makes his challenge to single combat;\n*David volunteers to fight Goliath;\n*David selects five smooth stones from a creek-bed to be used in his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]];\n*David defeats Goliath, the Philistines flee the battlefield.\n:''Additions''\n*David is sent by his father to bring food to his brothers, hears the challenge, and expresses his desire to accept; \n*Details of the account of the battle;\n*Saul asks who David is, and he is introduced to the king through Abner.{{sfn|Johnson|2015|p=10-11}}{{efn|[http://kukis.org/Samuel/1Sam_17.htm#The%20LXX%20%E2%82%AC%20of%20I%20Samuel%2017%20(with%20the%20Missing%20Portions%20in%20Magenta) Compare texts of short and long versions of 1 Samuel 17].}}\n\n==Textual considerations==\n\n=== Goliath's height ===\n[[File:David and Goliath.jpg|thumb|''Goliath laughs at David'', 1915, by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[File:Andrea Vaccaro - David with the Head of Goliath.jpg|thumb|''David with the Head of Goliath'', circa 1635, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]]]\n\nThe oldest manuscripts, namely the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] text of Samuel from the late 1st century BCE, the 1st-century CE historian [[Josephus]], and the major Septuagint manuscripts, all give it as \"four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (unit)|span]]\" ({{convert|6|ft|9|in|disp=or}}), whereas the [[Masoretic Text]] has \"six cubits and a span\" ({{convert|9|ft|9|in|disp=or}}).<ref>Ehrlich, C.

Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Saul is a very tall man, but Goliath is a giant. Saul's exact height is not given, but he was a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet, David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). \"David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel).\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\n=== Elhanan and Goliath ===\n2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the [[Gittite]] was killed by \"[[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim]], the Bethlehemite.\" Some scholars believe that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic_history|Deutoronomic history]] changed the original text to displace the deed from the obscure Elhanan onto the more famous David.<ref name=Halperin>{{cite book |last1=Halpern |first1=Baruch |title=David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King |date=2003 |publisher=Wm.

The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names \"alwt\" and \"wlt\". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (\"glyt\"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name \"Goliath\" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.<ref>[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

[[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.</ref>\n\nThe Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers.

And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&nbsp;...\" After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says \"Hurry and kill me and rejoice.\" and David replies \"Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.\" Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.<ref>Charlesworth, James H. 1983.

He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).\n\nThe four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:\n \n* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]\n* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]\n* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]\n* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]\n\nThe name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. ''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules film called ''The Revenge of Hercules''.\n\n=={{anchor|David and Goliath}} Modern usage of \"David and Goliath\"==\n{{redirect|David and Goliath}}\nIn modern usage, the phrase \"David and Goliath\" has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref name=\"macmillan\">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Macmillan Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} \"used for describing a situation in which a small person or organization defeats a much larger one in a surprising way\"</ref> It is arguably the most famous underdog story.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/main-articles/david-and-goliath.aspx | title=David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Bodner, Keith}}</ref>\n\n[[Theology]] professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, \"David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages\", explains that \"most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ...

Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the [[champion]] of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. [[David]], bringing food for his elder brothers on the battlefield, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. \"The Philistine cursed David by his gods\", but David replies: \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.\"\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]\". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him.

The designation of Goliath as a {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}, \"man of the in-between\" (a longstanding difficulty in translating 1 Samuel 17) appears to be a borrowing from Greek \"man of the ''{{transl|grc|metaikhmion}}'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}})\", i.e. the space between two opposite army camps where [[Champion warfare|champion combat]] would take place.<ref>[http://berlinarchaeology.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/yadin-goliaths-armor.pdf Azzan Yadin, \"Goliath's Armor and the Israelite Collective Memory\"].

In each case an older and more experienced father figure (Nestor's own father, David's patron Saul) tells the boy that he is too young and inexperienced, but in each case the young hero receives divine aid and the giant is left sprawling on the ground.

The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names \"alwt\" and \"wlt\". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (\"glyt\"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name \"Goliath\" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.<ref>[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

[[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.</ref>\n\nThe Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.<ref>For a brief overview of Talmudic traditions on Goliath, see [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia, \"Goliath\"].</ref>\n\nIn [[Pseudo-Philo]], believed to have been composed between 135&nbsp;BC and 70&nbsp;AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says \"Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&nbsp;...\" After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says \"Hurry and kill me and rejoice.\" and David replies \"Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.\" Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.<ref>Charlesworth, James H. 1983.

This film includes the King of the Philistines saying, \"Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.\" It is then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.\n\nThe PBS series ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'' featured Goliath in its first-season episode \"Little Big Dog\".\n\nBig Idea's popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode was called \"[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]\", where [[Phil Vischer]] voiced Goliath.\n\nIn 1972, [[Toho]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] collaborated on a film called ''[[Daigoro vs. Goliath]]'', which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as [[Kaiju]].\n\nIn 1975, Israeli band [[Poogy]] release a song called ''Golyat'' on the album [[Crowded in the Ear|''Tzafoof BaOzen'']], loosely and humorously based on the story.\n\n[[Suzanne Vega]]'s song ''Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)'' on the album [[99.9F\u00b0|''99.9\u00b0F'']] is based on the story.\n\nIn 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled \"One Smooth Stone\", which was later changed to \"David and Goliath\".

He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).\n\nThe four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:\n \n* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]\n* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]\n* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]\n* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]\n\nThe name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. ''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules film called ''The Revenge of Hercules''.\n\n=={{anchor|David and Goliath}} Modern usage of \"David and Goliath\"==\n{{redirect|David and Goliath}}\nIn modern usage, the phrase \"David and Goliath\" has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref name=\"macmillan\">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Macmillan Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} \"used for describing a situation in which a small person or organization defeats a much larger one in a surprising way\"</ref> It is arguably the most famous underdog story.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/main-articles/david-and-goliath.aspx | title=David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Bodner, Keith}}</ref>\n\n[[Theology]] professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, \"David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages\", explains that \"most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ...

She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Palestine]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained notoriety for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=\":0\">Bosworth, Patricia. Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story (1998)</ref>\n\nIn California, Bosworth had been educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nPatricia died on April 2, 2020 from the [[COVID-19]] virus. &nbsp;She was 86.\n\n==Acting career==\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>Garfield, David (1980). \"Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980\". A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. p. 277. {{ISBN|0-02-542650-8}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Journalist==\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>The X-Rated Emperor, Vanity Fair, February 2005</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n==Author==\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>Bosworth, Patricia. Diane Arbus: A Biography. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1984</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n== Death ==\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to pneumonia and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

She was a faculty member of [[Columbia University]]\u2019s [[Columbia University School of Journalism|school of journalism]] as well as [[Barnard College]], and was a winner of the [[Front Page Award]] for her journalistic achievement in writing about the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Blacklist]].<ref name=\"Bosworth\">\n{{Cite journal\n| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/patricia-bosworth-dead-hollywood-actress-turned-chronicler-dies-coronavirus-complications-at-86-1288456 \n| title=Patricia Bosworth, Hollywood Actress-Turned-Chronicler, Dies From Coronavirus Complications at 86 \n| journal=The Hollywood Reporter\n| date = 2 April 2020\n| accessdate= 3 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=Anything>\n{{cite book\n| first = Patricia\n| last = Bosworth\n| authorlink = Patricia Bosworth\n| title = Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story\n| publisher = Simon and Schuster\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G_mPAAAAMAAJ\n| date = 1997\n| accessdate = 4 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=Men>\n{{cite book\n| first = Patricia\n| last = Bosworth\n| authorlink = Patricia Bosworth\n| title = The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan\n| publisher = HarperCollins\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wXM1DAAAQBAJ\n| date = 31 January 2017\n| accessdate = 4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn '''Patricia Crum''' in Oakland, California, Bosworth was the daughter of prominent attorney [[Bartley Crum]] and novelist Anna Gertrude Bosworth. She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Palestine]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained notoriety for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=\":0\">Bosworth, Patricia. Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story (1998)</ref>\n\nIn California, Bosworth had been educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nPatricia died on April 2, 2020 from the [[COVID-19]] virus. &nbsp;She was 86.\n\n==Acting career==\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>Garfield, David (1980). \"Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980\". A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. p. 277. {{ISBN|0-02-542650-8}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Journalist==\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>The X-Rated Emperor, Vanity Fair, February 2005</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n==Author==\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>Bosworth, Patricia. Diane Arbus: A Biography. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1984</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n== Death ==\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to pneumonia and complications from the novel [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.
