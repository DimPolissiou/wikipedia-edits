It also drains the north side of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] while its main tributary, the [[Aras (river)|Aras]], drains the south side of those mountains. Starting in northeastern Turkey, it flows through Turkey to Georgia, then to Azerbaijan, where it receives the Aras as a right tributary, and enters the Caspian Sea at [[Neft\u00e7ala]]. The total length of the river is {{convert|1515|km|mi}}.\n\nPeople have inhabited the Caucasus region for thousands of years, and first established [[agriculture]] in the Kura Valley over 4,500 years ago. Large, complex civilizations eventually grew up on the river, but by 1200 CE, most were reduced to ruin by natural disasters and foreign invaders. The increasing human use, and eventual damage, of the watershed\u2019s forests and grasslands contributed to a rising intensity of [[flood]]s through the 20th century. In the 1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] started building many dams and canals on the river. Previously navigable up to [[Tbilisi]] in Georgia, it is now much slower and shallower, as it has been harnessed by irrigation projects and [[hydroelectric]] [[power station]]s. The river is now moderately polluted by major industrial centers like Tbilisi and [[Rustavi]] in Georgia.\n\n==Name==\nThe name Kura is related either to [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] ''kur'' 'water, river' or to an ancient [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] term for 'reservoir'. The [[Georgian language|Georgian]] name of Kura is ''Mt'k'vari'' (in old Georgian ''Mt'k'uari''), either from Georgian \"good water\" or a Georgianized form of [[Megrelian]] ''tkvar-ua'' \"gnaw\" (as in, \"river that eats its way through the mountains\").<ref name=\"E.M.

The Kura River area is considered as part of the Kura-South Caspian Sea Drainages [[ecoregion]]. Some portions of the river flow through a semi-[[desert]] environment. Forest cover is sparse. Almost 60 species of fish inhabit the Kura River and its tributaries. Some common families include [[loach]], [[Alburnus|bleak]], [[trout]] and [[nase]], and many of these fish are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the region. Among rivers of the Caucasus, the Kura has the largest number of endemic species. The upper section of the river supports much more biodiversity than the lower half, which is typically more [[Turbidity|turbid]] and polluted. This pattern is also apparent in most of its tributaries, especially the larger ones that span more climate zones, such as the Aras and Alazani. There are many lakes and [[wetland]]s along the Kura's lower course, most of which are formed by flooding, and some of which are formed by irrigation runoff water. Many lakes also form at the mouths of small tributaries that do not reach the ultimate destination in the Caspian most of the time.

It also drains the north side of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] while its main tributary, the [[Aras (river)|Aras]] drains the south side of those mountains. Starting in northeastern Turkey, it flows through Turkey to Georgia, then to Azerbaijan, where it receives the Aras as a right tributary, and enters the Caspian Sea at [[Neft\u00e7ala]]. The total length of the river is {{convert|1515|km|mi}}.\n\nPeople have inhabited the Caucasus region for thousands of years, and first established [[agriculture]] in the Kura Valley over 4,500 years ago. Large, complex civilizations eventually grew up on the river, but by 1200 CE, most were reduced to ruin by natural disasters and foreign invaders. The increasing human use, and eventual damage, of the watershed\u2019s forests and grasslands contributed to a rising intensity of [[flood]]s through the 20th century. In the 1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] started building many dams and canals on the river. Previously navigable up to [[Tbilisi]] in Georgia, it is now much slower and shallower, as it has been harnessed by irrigation projects and [[hydroelectric]] [[power station]]s. The river is now moderately polluted by major industrial centers like Tbilisi and [[Rustavi]] in Georgia.\n\n==Name==\nThe name Kura is related either to [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] ''kur'' 'water, river' or to an ancient [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] term for 'reservoir'. The [[Georgian language|Georgian]] name of Kura is ''Mt'k'vari'' (in old Georgian ''Mt'k'uari''), either from Georgian \"good water\" or a Georgianized form of [[Megrelian]] ''tkvar-ua'' \"gnaw\" (as in, \"river that eats its way through the mountains\").<ref name=\"E.M.

Many forested areas in the mountains have been replaced by thin grassland because of logging. These habitat changes have been detrimental to the ecology of the Kura basin.

In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.

Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H.

Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to the Town of Cornwall.  In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the local post office.  In 1902, the company was in financial trouble and defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership of the company.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|title=Cornwall Street Railway Light & Power Co.|last=|first=|date=|website=trainweb.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990828230041/http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|archive-date=1999-08-28|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10|alt=]]In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.
