It is a member of the [[Rugby Group]] and though originally a major boys' public school in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular, [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed, re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. In memory of Haileyburians who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], a war memorial [[obelisk]] made of portland stone and decorated with bronze, was erected on the main axis of the school's entrance front in 1903. It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, also designed by Sir Reginald, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity.

Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997, the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by German organ builder, [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing.

{"title_page": "Rear admiral", "text_new": "{{short description|Naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{Military ranks}}\n{{Navalranks}}\n'''Rear admiral''' is a senior [[naval]] [[flag officer]] rank, equivalent to a [[major general]] and [[air vice marshal]] and above that of a [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and [[Captain (naval)|captain]], but below that of a [[vice admiral]]. It is regarded as a two star \"[[admiral]]\" rank. In many navies it is referred to as (OF-7)/(O-7).\n\nIt originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the [[Royal Navy]].  Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head, who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron.  The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle.  In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals. This has survived into the modern age, with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies.\n\nIn some European navies (e.g., that of [[French Navy|France]]), and in the Canadian Forces' French rank translations, the rank of rear admiral is known as ''[[contre-amiral]]''. In the [[German Navy]] the rank is known as [[Konteradmiral]], superior to the [[flotilla admiral]] (Commodore in other navies). In the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], this rank is known as ''[[schout-bij-nacht]]'' (lit.: supervisor during night), denoting the role junior to the squadron admiral, and fleet admiral.\n\n==Australia==\n{{main|Rear admiral (Australia)}}\n{{Infobox military rank\n| name           = Rear admiral (Australia)\n| image          = Royal Australian Navy OF-7.svg\n| image_size     = 60px\n| caption        = The RADM insignia\n| image2         = Royal Australian Navy (sleeves) OF-7.svg\n| image_size2    = 60px\n| caption2       =\n| country        = {{flag|Australia}}\n| service branch = {{navy|Australia}}\n| abbreviation   = RADM\n| rank           = [[two-star rank|Two-star]]\n| NATO rank      = [[Ranks and insignia of NATO armies officers#Officers (OF 1\u201310)|O-9]]\n| Non-NATO rank  =\n| formation      =\n| abolished      =\n| higher rank    = [[Vice admiral (Australia)|Vice admiral]]\n| lower rank     = [[Commodore (Australia)|Commodore]]\n| equivalents    = {{bulleted list|{{nowrap|[[Major general (Australia)|Major general]] ([[Australian Army|Army]])}}|{{nowrap|[[Air vice-marshal (Australia)|Air vice-marshal]] ([[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]) }}  }} \n| history        =\n}}\nThe [[Royal Australian Navy]] maintains a rank of rear admiral; refer to [[Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia]]. The abbreviation is RADM.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the insignia of a Royal Australian Navy rear admiral is the [[Crown of St. Edward]] above a crossed sword and baton, above two silver stars, above the word \"Australia\". Like the [[Royal Navy]] version, the sword is a traditional naval [[cutlass]]. The stars have eight points, unlike the four pointed [[Order of the Bath]] stars used by the army (which are often referred to as \"pips\"). Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Royal Navy]] shoulder board. The Royal Navy shoulder board changed again in 2001 and the Australian and UK shoulder boards are now identical except for the word \"Australia\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/about/organisation/uniform-ranks |title=Uniform Ranks |work=Royal Australian Navy |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |accessdate=17 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124133502/http://www.navy.gov.au/about/organisation/uniform-ranks |archivedate=24 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRear Admiral [[Robyn Walker]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AM|RAN}} became the first female admiral in the Royal Australian Navy when she was appointed Surgeon-General of the [[Australian Defence Force]] on 16 December 2011.<ref>{{ cite news |title=First female Admiral for the Royal Australian Navy |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2011/dec/1216.htm |date= 6 December 2011 |publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Australian Government]] |work=Defence News }}</ref>\n\n==Canada==\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], the rank of rear-admiral (RAdm) (''contre-amiral'' or ''CAm'' in [[French language|French]]) is the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Navy]] rank equivalent to [[major-general]] of the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Army]] and [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Air Force]]. A rear-admiral is a [[flag officer]], the naval equivalent of a [[general officer]]. A rear-admiral is senior to a [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and [[brigadier-general]], and junior to a [[vice-admiral]] and [[lieutenant-general]].\n\nThe rank insignia for a rear-admiral is two silver maple leaves beneath a silver crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by [[St Edward's Crown]], worn on gold shoulder boards on the white short-sleeved shirt or the tropical white tunic.

Interpreted as \"watch-at-night\", the ''schout-bij-nacht'' was the officer who supervised the ship when the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] was asleep.\n\nIn later times the ''schout-bij-nacht'' was also the officer who supervised an entire naval squadron, in the absence of a senior [[admiral]], and by the 17th century ''schout-bij-nacht'' was the common rank held by the naval commander of a battle fleet's rear squadron.\n\nIn the 17th century the navies of [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark-Norway]] adopted the rank as ''schoutbynacht'' and the early [[Imperial Russian Navy]] as \u0448\u0430\u0443\u0442\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0442 (\"shautbenakht\").

It is regarded as a two star \"[[admiral]]\" rank. In many navies it is referred to as (OF-7)/(O-7).\n\nIt originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the [[Royal Navy]].  Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head, who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron.  The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle.  In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals. This has survived into the modern age, with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies.\n\nIn some European navies (e.g., that of [[French Navy|France]]), and in the Canadian Forces' French rank translations, the rank of rear admiral is known as ''[[contre-amiral]]''. In the [[German Navy]] the rank is known as [[Konteradmiral]], superior to the [[flotilla admiral]] (Commodore in other navies). In the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], this rank is known as ''[[schout-bij-nacht]]'' (lit.: supervisor during night), denoting the role junior to the squadron admiral, and fleet admiral.\n\n==Australia==\n{{main|Rear admiral (Australia)}}\n{{Infobox military rank\n| name           = Rear admiral (Australia)\n| image          = Royal Australian Navy OF-7.svg\n| image_size     = 60px\n| caption        = The RADM insignia\n| image2         = Royal Australian Navy (sleeves) OF-7.svg\n| image_size2    = 60px\n| caption2       =\n| country        = {{flag|Australia}}\n| service branch = {{navy|Australia}}\n| abbreviation   = RADM\n| rank           = [[two-star rank|Two-star]]\n| NATO rank      = [[Ranks and insignia of NATO armies officers#Officers (OF 1\u201310)|O-9]]\n| Non-NATO rank  =\n| formation      =\n| abolished      =\n| higher rank    = [[Vice admiral (Australia)|Vice admiral]]\n| lower rank     = [[Commodore (Australia)|Commodore]]\n| equivalents    = {{bulleted list|{{nowrap|[[Major general (Australia)|Major general]] ([[Australian Army|Army]])}}|{{nowrap|[[Air vice-marshal (Australia)|Air vice-marshal]] ([[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]) }}  }} \n| history        =\n}}\nThe [[Royal Australian Navy]] maintains a rank of rear admiral; refer to [[Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia]].

Like the [[Royal Navy]] version, the sword is a traditional naval [[cutlass]]. The stars have eight points, unlike the four pointed [[Order of the Bath]] stars used by the army (which are often referred to as \"pips\"). Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Royal Navy]] shoulder board.

He argued that alongside ''Splatoon'', there was \"plenty of room for more colorful, poppy, kid-friendly multiplayer games\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/ninjala-is-cute-in-concept-but-it-s-certainly-no-splatoon-507889.phtml|title=Ninjala is cute in concept but it's certainly no Splatoon|work=Destructoid|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref> ''[[IGN.com]]'' similarly noted that its concept felt like \"''Splatoon'' meets ''[[Arms (video game)|Arms]]''\", and that \"if GungHo makes good on delivering creative weaponry and polishes up the combat, ''Ninjala'' might just have what it takes to beat Nintendo at its own game.\"<ref name=\"ign-e3tease\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/19/ninjala-splatoon-meets-arms-on-nintendo-switch|title=Ninjala - Splatoon Meets ARMS on Nintendo Switch|last=Miucin|first=Filip|date=2018-06-19|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|http://ninjalathegame.com}}\n\n[[Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2020]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Ninja video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch-only games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Versus fighting games]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: widely- \u2192 widely", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjala"}

Graysmith saw the letters arriving at ''The Chronicle'' and became intrigued. For years the cartoonist kept his own scrapbook of evidence, from which he independently attempted to determine the Zodiac's identity. When asked why he began working on the book, Graysmith replied, \"I saw it going into obscurity. Nobody is sharing all the different jurisdictions, and all this information. What if I as a private citizen went around and got all this information?\"  This led to a 10-year period to collect information, and eventually the book was published in 1986 after a number of delays.<ref>{{cite web| website=Zodiac Killer Facts| url=http://www.zodiackillerfacts.com/graysmith.htm#book |title=Zodiac Killer - Robert Graysmith Unmasked|accessdate=October 16, 2010|author=Graysmith, Robert}}</ref>\n\n==Film==\nThe film adaptation ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' (2007) is roughly based on Graysmith's books, ''Zodiac'' (1986) and ''Zodiac Unmasked'' (2002).
