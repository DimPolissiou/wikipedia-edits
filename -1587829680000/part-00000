The type possessed low operational costs and initially had scant competition in the 100-seat short-range [[regional jet]] class, contributing to strong sales upon introduction in the late 1980s.\n\nAn increasing number of similar airliners were brought to market by competitors during the 1990s, leading to a substantial decline in both sales and long-term prospects for the 100. Fokker also encountered financial difficulties and was acquired by [[DASA|Deutsche Aerospace AG]], which had financial troubles of its own, restricting its ability to support multiple regional airliner programmes. In 1997, production of the Fokker 100 was terminated after 283 airframes had been delivered.\n\nBy July 2019, a total of 101 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 19 airlines around the world.<ref>Thisdell and Seymour ''Flight International'' 30 July \u20135 August 2019, p. 46.</ref> Since the 2000s, airlines are retiring the aircraft, but there are still large numbers in operation in Australia and Iran.<ref name=\"nyt-dec-26-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Troianovsky |first1=Anton |last2=Victor |first2=Daniel |title=At Least 9 Killed in Plane Crash in Kazakhstan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/asia/plane-crash-almaty-kazakhstan.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2019 |date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\nThe ''F28 Mark 0100'' \u201cFokker 100\u201d is based on the [[Fokker F28]] Mark 4000 [[re-engine]]d with two [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay]] high by-pass ratio turbofans and a [[fuselage stretch]]ed by {{cvt|18.83|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nIts wing is wider by {{cvt|9.8|ft}}, has new flaps and larger ailerons, and extended leading and trailing edges improve aerodynamics and increase the [[chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]].<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe landing gear is strengthened and has new wheels and brakes, and the [[horizontal stabilizer]] is widened by {{cvt|4.6|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nMaximum weights are increased while fuel capacity, max speed and ceiling remain the same, and passenger capacity went from 85 to 109.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe flight deck went digital with a [[flight management system]], an autopilot/[[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] including CAT III [[autoland]], [[Autothrust|thrust management]] system, [[Electronic flight instrument system|electronic flight instrument]] displays and full [[ARINC]] avionics.<ref name=TCDS>{{cite web |url= https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/TCDS_EASA.A.037_Fokker_F28_Iss_07_20180903%20FINAL.PDF |title= Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A.037 for Fokker F28 |publisher= EASA |date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new wing was claimed to be 30% more efficient in cruise, while retaining the simplicity of a fixed [[leading edge]]. The cockpit was updated with a [[Rockwell Collins]] DU-1000 EFIS. Like the Fokker Fellowship, the Fokker 100 retained the twin rear fuselage-mounted engines and [[T-tail]] configuration, like the [[Douglas DC-9]] family.

The type possessed low operational costs and initially had scant competition in the 100-seat short-range [[regional jet]] class, contributing to strong sales upon introduction in the late 1980s.\n\nAn increasing number of similar airliners were brought to market by competitors during the 1990s, leading to a substantial decline in both sales and long-term prospects for the 100. Fokker also encountered financial difficulties and was bought up by [[DASA|Deutsche Aerospace AG]], which had financial troubles of its own, restricting its ability to support multiple regional airliner programmes. In 1997, production of the Fokker 100 was terminated after 283 airframes had been delivered.\n\nBy July 2019, a total of 101 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 19 airlines around the world.<ref>Thisdell and Seymour ''Flight International'' 30 July \u20135 August 2019, p. 46.</ref> Since the 2000s, airlines are retiring the aircraft, but there are still large numbers in operation in Australia and Iran.<ref name=\"nyt-dec-26-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Troianovsky |first1=Anton |last2=Victor |first2=Daniel |title=At Least 9 Killed in Plane Crash in Kazakhstan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/asia/plane-crash-almaty-kazakhstan.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2019 |date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\nThe ''F28 Mark 0100'' \u201cFokker 100\u201d is based on the [[Fokker F28]] Mark 4000 [[re-engine]]d with two [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay]] high by-pass ratio turbofans and a [[fuselage stretch]]ed by {{cvt|18.83|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nIts wing is wider by {{cvt|9.8|ft}}, has new flaps and larger ailerons, and extended leading and trailing edges improve aerodynamics and increase the [[chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]].<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe landing gear is strengthened and has new wheels and brakes, and the [[horizontal stabilizer]] is widened by {{cvt|4.6|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nMaximum weights are increased while fuel capacity, max speed and ceiling remain the same, and passenger capacity went from 85 to 109.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe flight deck went digital with a [[flight management system]], an autopilot/[[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] including CAT III [[autoland]], [[Autothrust|thrust management]] system, [[Electronic flight instrument system|electronic flight instrument]] displays and full [[ARINC]] avionics.<ref name=TCDS>{{cite web |url= https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/TCDS_EASA.A.037_Fokker_F28_Iss_07_20180903%20FINAL.PDF |title= Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A.037 for Fokker F28 |publisher= EASA |date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new wing was claimed to be 30% more efficient in cruise, while retaining the simplicity of a fixed [[leading edge]].

It is {{convert|55|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[Belfast]] and {{convert|30|mi|km|1}} east of [[Derry]], both of which are linked by major roads and railway connections. It is part of [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] district.\n\n== Description ==\nColeraine had a population of 24,634 people in the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]].<ref name=\"NISRA2011Census\"/> [[Disposable income]] is well above the Northern Ireland average. The North Coast (Coleraine and [[Limavady]]) area has the highest property prices in Northern Ireland, higher even than those of affluent South Belfast.<ref>University of Ulster Quarterly House Price Index report produced in partnership with Bank of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive \u2013 March 2006</ref> Golf courses, countryside and leisure facilities and attractions are to be found. It also contains a [[marina]]. Coleraine during the day is a busy town, however, at night the town is relatively quiet, with much of the nightlife in the area located in the nearby seaside towns of [[Portrush]] and [[Portstewart]]. Coleraine is also home to one of the largest Polish communities in Northern Ireland.\n\nColeraine is situated at the lowest bridgeable point of the River Bann, where the river is 90 metres wide. The town square is called 'The Diamond' and is the location of the Town Hall. St. Patrick's [[Church of Ireland]] is situated nearby. The [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|University of Ulster campus]] was built in the 1960s and has brought a theatrical space to the town in the form of the [[Riverside Theatre, Coleraine|Riverside Theatre]].\n\nColeraine has been designated as a major growth area in the Northern Ireland Development Strategy. Although the population of the town is only 25,000, Coleraine has a large catchment area. In 2002, Coleraine won the Best Kept Town and Ulster in Bloom awards. In 2003, it was selected to represent Northern Ireland in the prestigious [[Britain in Bloom]] competition. In the 2010 SuperValu Best Kept Awards, Coleraine was named the Best Kept Large Town in Northern Ireland; this is a prestigious award which commends towns throughout Northern Ireland for their work to improve the local environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has its own local radio station: [[Q97.2FM]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Diamond, Coleraine, circa 1890?

When [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] arrived in the neighbourhood, he was received with great honour and hospitality by the local chieftain, Nadslua, who offered him a piece of ground on which to build a church. The spot was next to the river Bann and was overgrown with ferns, which were being burned by some boys to amuse themselves. This incident led to the area being called ''C\u00fail Raithin'' (\"nook of ferns\"), which was later anglicised as '''Colrain''', '''Colerain''' and '''Coleraine'''. It was translated by [[John Colgan|Colgan]] into Latin as ''Secessus Filicis''.\n\nThe town was one of the two urban communities developed by the London Companies in County Londonderry in the [[Plantation of Ulster]] at the start of the 17th century. The slightly skewed street pattern of Coleraine's town centre is legacy of that early exercise in town planning, along with traces of the lines of the ramparts that provided the Plantation town with its defences. In 1637 the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of customs due from each port and their \"subsidiary creeks\". Of the Ulster ports on the list, [[Carrickfergus]] was first, followed by [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], [[Donaghadee]], and [[Strangford]]. [[Carlingford, County Louth|Carlingford]] and Coleraine each had \u00a3244 customs due and had equal ranking.<ref name=\"OB\">{{cite book |author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin| year=2007 |title=Maritime Ireland.

[[Richard Hamilton (officer)|Richard Hamilton]]'s [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] made an attempt to seize the town but was repulsed. The Protestants were forced to abandon the town shortly afterwards and withdrew to [[Derry]]. Later the same year, following the failed [[Siege of Derry]], Sir [[Charles Carney (Jacobite)|Charles Carney]] and his Jacobite garrison fled the town on receiving news of the advance of [[Percy Kirke]]'s [[Enniskillen]] forces and the [[Siege of Carrickfergus (1689)|landing at Carrickfergus]] of [[Marshal Schomberg]]. The [[Williamite]]s controlled Coleraine for the remainder of the war.\n\nWith some industrialisation, the expansion of the river port, and the development of the railway, the town expanded significantly throughout the 19th century and into the early part of the 20th century, especially after the Second World War.  The population doubled due to a number of factors: major industrial development on extensive suburban sites; the decision to site the New University of Ulster (now known as the [[Ulster University]]) in the town; the expansion of commerce; and the development of sporting and recreational facilities. There has been a steady expansion of the urban area from the mid 20th-century compact town of less than 2\u00bc&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (3&nbsp;km\u00b2), to the present much more dispersed area of about 7&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (11&nbsp;km\u00b2). During the [[Northern Irish Troubles]] 13 people were killed in or near Coleraine, ten of them in two separate car bomb explosions.\n\nSince 1980 growth has continued but at a slightly more modest pace. In the twenty years to 2001 the town's population increased by 22% to approximately 25,000 but the rate of increase fell from 12% in the 1980s to 8% in the 1990s.<ref name=\"NAP2016\">{{cite web |format=PDF \n|title= Northern Area Plan 2016 \u2013 Technical Supplement 1 (Population and Housing)\n|url=https://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/dev_plans/devplans_az/northern_2016/northern2016-techsupp-01-population.pdf |publisher= The Planning Service |website= planningni.gov.uk |date= May 2005 |accessdate= 1 February 2018}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n=== The Troubles ===\n{{main|The Troubles in Coleraine}}\n\n== In Literature ==\n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L.

In 2014, the residents elected 3 [[Democratic Unionist Party]], 2 [[Ulster Unionist Party]], 1 [[Progressive Unionist Party]], 1 [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]] and 1 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] councillors.\n\n== Tourism ==\nColeraine is close to the [[Causeway Coast]] tourist route, which attracts over three million visitors per year, spending in excess of \u00a347&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web | title=Investing in Coleraine | work=Capital of the Causeway Coast | url=http://www.coleraine.co.uk/htmlsite/investing.asp?step=2&id=4&pstring=4 | accessdate=14 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607212748/http://www.coleraine.co.uk/htmlsite/investing.asp?step=2&id=4&pstring=4 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 June 2007}}</ref> A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the [[Giant's Causeway]], is a twenty\u2013five-minute bus ride away.

It also contains a [[marina]]. Coleraine during the day is a busy town, however, at night the town is relatively quiet, with much of the nightlife in the area located in the nearby seaside towns of [[Portrush]] and [[Portstewart]]. Coleraine is also home to one of the largest Polish communities in Northern Ireland.\n\nColeraine is situated at the lowest bridgeable point of the River Bann, where the river is 90 metres wide. The town square is called 'The Diamond' and is the location of the Town Hall. St. Patrick's [[Church of Ireland]] is situated nearby. The [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|University of Ulster campus]] was built in the 1960s and has brought a theatrical space to the town in the form of the [[Riverside Theatre, Coleraine|Riverside Theatre]].\n\nColeraine has been designated as a major growth area in the Northern Ireland Development Strategy. Although the population of the town is only 25,000, Coleraine has a large catchment area. In 2002, Coleraine won the Best Kept Town and Ulster in Bloom awards. In 2003, it was selected to represent Northern Ireland in the prestigious [[Britain in Bloom]] competition. In the 2010 SuperValu Best Kept Awards, Coleraine was named the Best Kept Large Town in Northern Ireland; this is a prestigious award which commends towns throughout Northern Ireland for their work to improve the local environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has its own local radio station: [[Q97.2FM]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Diamond, Coleraine, circa 1890?

When [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] arrived in the neighbourhood, he was received with great honour and hospitality by the local chieftain, Nadslua, who offered him a piece of ground on which to build a church. The spot was next to the river Bann and was overgrown with ferns, which were being burned by some boys to amuse themselves. This incident led to the area being called ''C\u00fail Raithin'' (\"nook of ferns\"), which was later anglicised as '''Colrain''', '''Colerain''' and '''Coleraine'''. It was translated by [[John Colgan|Colgan]] into Latin as ''Secessus Filicis''.\n\nThe town was one of the two urban communities developed by the London Companies in County Londonderry in the [[Plantation of Ulster]] at the start of the 17th century. The slightly skewed street pattern of Coleraine's town centre is legacy of that early exercise in town planning, along with traces of the lines of the ramparts that provided the Plantation town with its defences. In 1637 the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of customs due from each port and their \"subsidiary creeks\". Of the Ulster ports on the list, [[Carrickfergus]] was first, followed by [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], [[Donaghadee]], and [[Strangford]]. [[Carlingford, County Louth|Carlingford]] and Coleraine each had \u00a3244 customs due and had equal ranking.<ref name=\"OB\">{{cite book |author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin| year=2007 |title=Maritime Ireland.

[[Richard Hamilton (officer)|Richard Hamilton]]'s [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] made an attempt to seize the town but was repulsed. The Protestants were forced to abandon the town shortly afterwards and withdrew to [[Derry]]. Later the same year, following the failed [[Siege of Derry]], Sir [[Charles Carney (Jacobite)|Charles Carney]] and his Jacobite garrison fled the town on receiving news of the advance of [[Percy Kirke]]'s [[Enniskillen]] forces and the [[Siege of Carrickfergus (1689)|landing at Carrickfergus]] of [[Marshal Schomberg]]. The [[Williamite]]s controlled Coleraine for the remainder of the war.\n\nWith some industrialisation, the expansion of the river port, and the development of the railway, the town expanded significantly throughout the 19th century and into the early part of the 20th century, especially after the Second World War.  The population doubled due to a number of factors: major industrial development on extensive suburban sites; the decision to site the New University of Ulster (now known as the [[Ulster University]]) in the town; the expansion of commerce; and the development of sporting and recreational facilities. There has been a steady expansion of the urban area from the mid 20th-century compact town of less than 2\u00bc&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (3&nbsp;km\u00b2), to the present much more dispersed area of about 7&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (11&nbsp;km\u00b2). During the [[Northern Irish Troubles]] 13 people were killed in or near Coleraine, ten of them in two separate car bomb explosions.\n\nSince 1980 growth has continued but at a slightly more modest pace. In the twenty years to 2001 the town's population increased by 22% to approximately 25,000 but the rate of increase fell from 12% in the 1980s to 8% in the 1990s.<ref name=\"NAP2016\">{{cite web |format=PDF \n|title= Northern Area Plan 2016 \u2013 Technical Supplement 1 (Population and Housing)\n|url=https://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/dev_plans/devplans_az/northern_2016/northern2016-techsupp-01-population.pdf |publisher= The Planning Service |website= planningni.gov.uk |date= May 2005 |accessdate= 1 February 2018}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n=== The Troubles ===\n{{main|The Troubles in Coleraine}}\n\n== In Literature ==\n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L.
