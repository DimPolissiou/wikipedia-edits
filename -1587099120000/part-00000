Directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]] with co-direction by [[Lee Unkrich]], the screenplay was written by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|David Reynolds]], and Stanton from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of [[Albert Brooks]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Alexander Gould]], and [[Willem Dafoe]]. It tells the story of an overprotective [[clownfish]] named Marlin, who, along with a [[regal blue tang]] named Dory searches for his missing son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.\n\n''Finding Nemo'' was released on May 30, 2003, to positive reviews with praise to its animation, story, characters, and voice acting. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].

Nemo, despite being hampered by a lame fin, is eager to explore life around the ocean. Marlin, however, is overprotective of him, having lost his wife Coral and all their other eggs in a barracuda attack, leaving Nemo as his only child. On Nemo, first day of school, Marlin (after Nemo talks him into letting him go to school) tells Nemo that school may not be a good idea (since he says to Nemo there is no problem if Nemo doesn't go to school). He says it's no problem if Nemo doesn't because he can always wait five or six millenniums. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin unintentionally embarrasses him, and while Marlin is distracted with the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo defiantly sneaks away from the reef toward a speedboat, where he is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin tries to chase the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from acute short term memory loss, who accompanies him. During an encounter with three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating other fish, Marlin notices a diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo. Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed, which sends one of the sharks into a feeding frenzy, and Marlin and Dory narrowly escape, but are knocked unconscious when the sharks accidentally set off an old mine.\n\nMeanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia, where he meets the Tank Gang, including yellow tang Bubbles, sea star Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and damselfish Deb, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's young niece, Darla, whose rough treatment has killed most of her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing the dentist to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank is cleaned, giving them the opportunity to roll out the window and into the harbour. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed, leaving Gill guilt-ridden.\n\nMarlin and Dory wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep sea trench. Swimming after it, Marlin is chased by an anglerfish, while Dory reads the address and recites it repeatedly to commit it to memory. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards their instructions to take what he believes is a safer route, leading them into a forest of jellyfish where they end up unconscious from all the jellyfish stings. Marlin and Dory wake up to find themselves on the East Australian Current with a group of friendly sea turtles including Crush and his son Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, impressing them, and news spreads across the ocean, all the way to the dentist's office, where a pelican named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds, and soon the aquarium's contents are covered in green algae.\n\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a blue whale. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel, who help the pair escape from a group of seagulls and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter, the AquaScum 2003, foiling the Tank Gang's escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist prepares to give Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel causes a disturbance, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain that leads to the ocean.\n\nThinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory (after thanking her and saying he's going home on his own) and begins his journey home. Marlin's departure causes Dory to lose her memory. She meets Nemo as he reaches the ocean, but does not remember him. However, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught by a fishing boat with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the boat's net so they can escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr. Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip. At the dentist\u2019s, the Aquascum 2003 has broken, and the gang, having been put in bag, roll out of the window and into the sea. Still stuck in bags, they ponder what happens next.\n\n==Voice cast{{anchor|Cast}}==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}<!-- All species need to be sourced -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Marlin, a [[clownfish]] and Nemo's father.\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[regal blue tang]] with short-term memory loss.\n* [[Alexander Gould]] as Nemo, Marlin's only surviving son, who is excited about life and exploring the ocean, but gets captured and domesticated as a pet.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Gill, a [[moorish idol]] fish living in an aquarium in a dentist clinic, and the leader of the Tank Gang.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bloat, the aquarium's [[porcupinefish]].\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Peach, the aquarium's [[starfish]].\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Bubbles, the aquarium's [[yellow tang]] fish.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Gurgle, the aquarium's [[royal gramma]] fish.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Deb/Flo, the aquarium's [[Dascyllus melanurus|striped damselfish]].\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Jacques, the aquarium's [[cleaner shrimp]].\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Nigel, an [[Australian pelican]], who often visits the dentist clinic and is friends with the aquarium fish.\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] as Crush, a [[green sea turtle]].\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Coral, Marlin's wife and Nemo's mother.\n* [[Nicholas Bird]] as Squirt, Crush's son.\n* [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] as Mr. Ray, a [[spotted eagle ray]] and Nemo's schoolteacher.\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bruce, a vegetarian [[great white shark]], who fights his instinctive wills to eat innocent fish and is friends with Anchor and Chum.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Anchor, a [[hammerhead shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Chum.\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Chum, a [[mako shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Anchor.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as The Dentist.\n* LuLu Ebeling as Darla, the dentist's rambunctious young niece.\n* Jordy Ranft as Tad, a [[butterfly fish]] fingerling and Nemo's school friend.\n* Erica Beck as Pearl, a young [[flapjack octopus]] and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Sheldon, a young [[seahorse]], and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as the school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]].\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name=\"commentary\">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[National Geographic|''National Geographic'' magazine]], Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:\n\n{{quote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish\u2014it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>\n}}\n\nIn addition, clownfish are colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called \"very unusual for an animated film\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nStanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died, but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nThe casting of [[Albert Brooks]], in Stanton's opinion, \"saved\" the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\n\nThe idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nStanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]\" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/megan%20mullally%20dropped%20from%20finding%20nemo|title=Megan Mullally&nbsp;\u2013 Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo|publisher=WENN|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography.

The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Additionally, it became the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]] at the time of its release, and was the [[2003 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2003]], earning a total of $871&nbsp;million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run.<ref name=BOinitial>{{cite web |title=Finding Nemo (2003) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=findingnemo.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831031932/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=findingnemo.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Finding Nemo'' is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold {{as of|2006|lc=y}},<ref>Boone, Louis E.''Contemporary Business 2006'', Thomson South-Western, page 4&nbsp;\u2013 {{ISBN|0-324-32089-2}}</ref> and was the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G-rated]] film of all time before Pixar's own ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' overtook it.

Nemo, despite being hampered by a lame fin, is eager to explore life around the ocean. Marlin, however, is overprotective of him, having lost his wife Coral and all their other eggs in a barracuda attack, leaving Nemo as his only child. On Nemo, first day of school, Marlin (after Nemo talks him into letting him go to school) tells Nemo that school may not be a good idea (since he says to Nemo there is no problem if Nemo doesn't go to school). He says it's no problem if Nemo doesn't because he can always wait five or six millenniums. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin unintentionally embarrasses him, and while Marlin is distracted with the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo defiantly sneaks away from the reef toward a speedboat, where he is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin tries to chase the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from acute short term memory loss, who accompanies him. During an encounter with three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating other fish, Marlin notices a diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo. Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed, which sends one of the sharks into a feeding frenzy, and Marlin and Dory narrowly escape, but are knocked unconscious when the sharks accidentally set off an old mine.\n\nMeanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia, where he meets the Tank Gang, including yellow tang Bubbles, sea star Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and damselfish Deb, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's young niece, Darla, whose rough treatment has killed most of her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing the dentist to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank is cleaned, giving them the opportunity to roll out the window and into the harbour. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed, leaving Gill guilt-ridden.\n\nMarlin and Dory wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep sea trench. Swimming after it, Marlin is chased by an anglerfish, while Dory reads the address and recites it repeatedly to commit it to memory. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards their instructions to take what he believes is a safer route, leading them into a forest of jellyfish where they end up unconscious from all the jellyfish stings. Marlin and Dory wake up to find themselves on the East Australian Current with a group of friendly sea turtles including Crush and his son Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, impressing them, and news spreads across the ocean, all the way to the dentist's office, where a pelican named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds, and soon the aquarium's contents are covered in green algae.\n\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a blue whale. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel, who help the pair escape from a group of seagulls and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter, the AquaScum 2003, foiling the Tank Gang's escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist prepares to give Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel causes a disturbance, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain that leads to the ocean.\n\nThinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory (after thanking her and saying he's going home on his own) and begins his journey home. Marlin's departure causes Dory to lose her memory. She meets Nemo as he reaches the ocean, but does not remember him. However, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught by a fishing boat with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the boat's net so they can escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr. Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip. At the dentist\u2019s, the Aquascum 2003 has broken, and the gang, having been put in bag, roll out of the window and into the sea. Still stuck in bags, they ponder what happens next.\n\n==Voice cast{{anchor|Cast}}==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}<!-- All species need to be sourced -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Marlin, a [[clownfish]] and Nemo's father.\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[regal blue tang]] with short-term memory loss.\n* [[Alexander Gould]] as Nemo, Marlin's only surviving son, who is excited about life and exploring the ocean, but gets captured and domesticated as a pet.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Gill, a [[moorish idol]] fish living in an aquarium in a dentist clinic, and the leader of the Tank Gang.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bloat, the aquarium's [[porcupinefish]].\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Peach, the aquarium's [[starfish]].\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Bubbles, the aquarium's [[yellow tang]] fish.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Gurgle, the aquarium's [[royal gramma]] fish.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Deb/Flo, the aquarium's [[Dascyllus melanurus|striped damselfish]].\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Jacques, the aquarium's [[cleaner shrimp]].\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Nigel, an [[Australian pelican]], who often visits the dentist clinic and is friends with the aquarium fish.\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] as Crush, a [[green sea turtle]].\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Coral, Marlin's wife and Nemo's mother.\n* [[Nicholas Bird]] as Squirt, Crush's son.\n* [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] as Mr. Ray, a [[spotted eagle ray]] and Nemo's schoolteacher.\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bruce, a vegetarian [[great white shark]], who fights his instinctive wills to eat innocent fish and is friends with Anchor and Chum.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Anchor, a [[hammerhead shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Chum.\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Chum, a [[mako shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Anchor.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as The Dentist.\n* LuLu Ebeling as Darla, the dentist's rambunctious young niece.\n* Jordy Ranft as Tad, a [[butterfly fish]] fingerling and Nemo's school friend.\n* Erica Beck as Pearl, a young [[flapjack octopus]] and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Sheldon, a young [[seahorse]], and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as the school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]].\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name=\"commentary\">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[National Geographic|''National Geographic'' magazine]], Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:\n\n{{quote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish\u2014it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>\n}}\n\nIn addition, clownfish are colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called \"very unusual for an animated film\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nStanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died, but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nThe casting of [[Albert Brooks]], in Stanton's opinion, \"saved\" the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\n\nThe idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nStanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]\" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/megan%20mullally%20dropped%20from%20finding%20nemo|title=Megan Mullally&nbsp;\u2013 Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo|publisher=WENN|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography.
