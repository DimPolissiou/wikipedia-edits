Throughout his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r battled rival claimants to the throne, permanently losing about half of his realm to a rival dynasty in the process. Although dethroned for nearly a decade, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r clawed his way back to regain control of a partitioned kingdom, and proceeded to project power into Ireland. Although originally opposed to the English invasion of Ireland, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r adeptly recognised the English ascendancy in the Irish Sea region and aligned himself with the English. All later kings of the [[Crovan dynasty]] descended from Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r.\n\nIn the last year of his father's reign, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was absent at the court of [[Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway]], forging closer ties with the [[Kingdom of Norway]]. When \u00d3l\u00e1fr was assassinated by rival members of the Crovan dynasty in 1153, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles, overthrew his usurping cousins, and seized the throne for himself. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r evidently pursued a more aggressive policy than his father, and the following year appears to have lent military assistance to [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] in the latter's bid for the high-kingship of Ireland. Not long afterwards, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r faced a dynastic challenge from his brother-in-law, [[Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll]], whose son, as a grandson of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, possessed a claim to the throne. Late in 1156, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r and Somaile fought an inconclusive sea-battle and partitioned the kingdom of the Isles between them. Two years later Somairle stuck again and forced Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r from the Isles altogether.\n\nGu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have spent his exile in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] before journeying to Norway. In about 1161, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r distinguished himself in the ongoing Norwegian civil wars at the final downfall of Ingi. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r made his return to the Isles in 1164, in the aftermath of Somairle's defeat and death at the hands of the Scots. Although he regained the kingship itself, the territories ceded to Somairle in 1156 were retained by the latter's descendants. At some point in his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r briefly held the kingship of Dublin. Although he was initially successful in fending off Muirchertach, the Dubliners eventually settled with the latter, and Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles. This episode may have bearing on Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's marriage to Findguala ingen N\u00e9ill, Muirchertach's granddaughter. In 1170, Dublin fell to an Anglo-Irish alliance. The following year the ousted King of Dublin attempted to retake the town, and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]] attempted to dislodge the English from Dublin. In both cases, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have provided military assistance against the English. In succeeding years, however, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r aligned himself with one of the most powerful English conquerors, [[John de Courcy]]. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's assistance to John, who had married Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's daughter, [[Affrica Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir|Affrica]], may have played a critical role in John's successful conquest of the [[Kingdom of Ulaid]]. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r died in 1187 and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson|R\u01ebgnvaldr]]. Although Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r may have attempted to avert any succession disputes between his descendants, R\u01ebgnvaldr and his younger brother, [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr svarti]], eventually fought each other over the throne, and the resulting conflict carried on into later generations.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of Britain and Ireland|Locations relating to Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's life and times.]]\n\nGu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was a son of [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson (died 1153)|\u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, King of the Isles]]<ref>[[#M19|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#O2|Oram (2011)]] pp. xv tab. 4, xvi tab. 5; [[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#W10|Williams, G (2007)]] p. 141 ill. 14; [[#P1|Power (2005)]] p. 34 tab.; [[#B4|Brown (2004)]] p. 77 tab. 4.1; [[#S4|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#M3|McDonald (1997)]] p. 259 tab.; [[#D1|Duncan; Brown (1956\u20131957)]] p. 200 tab. ii; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 467 n. 2 tab.</ref> and his wife Affraic ingen Fergusa.<ref>[[#M19|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#O2|Oram (2011)]] pp. xv tab. 4, xvi tab. 5; [[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#W10|Williams, G (2007)]] p. 141 ill. 14; [[#S4|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i.</ref> The men were members of the [[Crovan dynasty]], a Norse-Gaelic kindred descended from [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Crovan, King of Dublin and the Isles]].<ref name=\"M1-25t1\">[[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1.</ref> Following Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Crovan's death in 1095, there is a period of uncertainty in the history of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]].

Throughout his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r battled rival claimants to the throne, permanently losing about half of his realm to a rival dynasty in the process. Although dethroned for nearly a decade, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r clawed his way back to regain control of a partitioned kingdom, and proceeded to project power into Ireland. Although originally opposed to the English invasion of Ireland, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r adeptly recognised the English ascendancy in the Irish Sea region and aligned himself with the English. All later kings of the [[Crovan dynasty]] descended from Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r.\n\nIn the last year of his father's reign, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was absent at the court of [[Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway]], forging closer ties with the [[Kingdom of Norway]]. When \u00d3l\u00e1fr was assassinated by rival members of the Crovan dynasty in 1153, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles, overthrew his usurping cousins, and seized the throne for himself. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r evidently pursued a more aggressive policy than his father, and the following year appears to have lent military assistance to [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] in the latter's bid for the high-kingship of Ireland. Not long afterwards, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r faced a dynastic challenge from his brother-in-law, [[Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll]], whose son, as a grandson of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, possessed a claim to the throne. Late in 1156, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r and Somaile fought an inconclusive sea-battle and partitioned the kingdom of the Isles between them. Two years later Somairle stuck again and forced Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r from the Isles altogether.\n\nGu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have spent his exile in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] before journeying to Norway. In about 1161, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r distinguished himself in the ongoing Norwegian civil wars at the final downfall of Ingi. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r made his return to the Isles in 1164, in the aftermath of Somairle's defeat and death at the hands of the Scots. Although he regained the kingship itself, the territories ceded to Somairle in 1156 were retained by the latter's descendants. At some point in his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r briefly held the kingship of Dublin. Although he was initially successful in fending off Muirchertach, the Dubliners eventually settled with the latter, and Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles. This episode may have bearing on Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's marriage to Findguala ingen N\u00e9ill, Muirchertach's granddaughter. In 1170, Dublin fell to an Anglo-Irish alliance. The following year the ousted King of Dublin attempted to retake the town, and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]] attempted to dislodge the English from Dublin. In both cases, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have provided military assistance against the English. In succeeding years, however, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r aligned himself with one of the most powerful English conquerors, [[John de Courcy]]. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's assistance to John, who had married Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's daughter, [[Affrica Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir|Affrica]], may have played a critical role in John's successful conquest of the [[Kingdom of Ulaid]]. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r died in 1187 and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson|R\u01ebgnvaldr]]. Although Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r may have attempted to avert any succession disputes between his descendants, R\u01ebgnvaldr and his younger brother, [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr svarti]], eventually fought each other over the throne, and the resulting conflict carried on into later generations.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of Britain and Ireland|Locations relating to Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's life and times.]]\n\nGu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was a son of [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson (died 1153)|\u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, King of the Isles]]<ref>[[#M19|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#O2|Oram (2011)]] pp. xv tab. 4, xvi tab. 5; [[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#W10|Williams, G (2007)]] p. 141 ill. 14; [[#P1|Power (2005)]] p. 34 tab.; [[#B4|Brown (2004)]] p. 77 tab. 4.1; [[#S4|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#M3|McDonald (1997)]] p. 259 tab.; [[#D1|Duncan; Brown (1956\u20131957)]] p. 200 tab. ii; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 467 n. 2 tab.</ref> and his wife Affraic ingen Fergusa.<ref>[[#M19|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#O2|Oram (2011)]] pp. xv tab. 4, xvi tab. 5; [[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#W10|Williams, G (2007)]] p. 141 ill. 14; [[#S4|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i.</ref> The men were members of the [[Crovan dynasty]], a Norse-Gaelic kindred descended from [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Crovan, King of Dublin and the Isles]].<ref name=\"M1-25t1\">[[#M1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1.</ref> Following Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Crovan's death in 1095, there is a period of uncertainty in the history of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]].

When the legion's cavalry battalion was consolidated with the 4th South Carolina Battalion and became the [[2nd Regiment South Carolina Cavalry|2nd South Carolina Cavalry Regiment]] on August 22, 1862, Butler was elected its colonel. Participating in many major actions with Hampton's Legion and the 2nd SC Cavalry, Butler lost his right foot to rifle fire at [[Battle of Brandy Station]]. He attained the rank of brigadier general in February 1864 and was referred to as \"General Butler\" in the postwar period.\n\nButler led a brigade in [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]]'s division of the [[Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Cavalry Corps]].

The program premiered on July 3, 2006, and currently airs every weeknights from 10:50{{nbsp}}PM to 11:20{{nbsp}}PM. It also airs worldwide via [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]].<ref>September 2006 issue of ''PJR Reports'' Center of Media Freedom and Responsibility</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Sanchez-Diaz-Drilon era (2006\u20132009)===\n''Bandila'' debuted on July 3, 2006 replacing ''[[ABS-CBN Insider|Insider]]'', with [[Korina Sanchez]] returning to newscasting after nearly two years since she left ''[[TV Patrol]]''. She was joined by [[Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon]] (who was one of the final anchors for ''Insider'' with Atty. Dong Puno) and [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as the original news anchors. During the pilot episode, it aired a video of General [[Danilo Lim]] organizing a coup d'\u00e9tat against former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].\n\n[[Maria Ressa]], then-head of [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]], explained ''Bandila'' as \"three colors, three stars, three anchors\"<ref name=ban>{{cite news|title=Kapamilya revamps late-night newscast|date=17 June 2006|publisher=inquirer.net|url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20060617-5297}}</ref> referring that of the [[Philippine flag]] having three colors. On the other hand, [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]], then head of Current Affairs, said that the title also depicts the news as \"banner stories\".<ref name=ban /> They also said that they choose three anchors for the late-night newscast as referring to the three stars in the Philippine flag, and chooses Sanchez, Omaga-Diaz and Ore\u00f1a-Drilon as the news anchors because they are the three of the most seasoned and experienced broadcast journalist in the network.\n\nDuring this period, ''Bandila'' covered the New Year Countdown for 2008 and 2009, after failing to air the 2007 New Year Countdown when New Year's Eve of 2006 fell on Sunday as ''Bandila'' airs on Monday-Friday.\n\n===Diaz-Drilon era (2009\u20132010)===\nOn May 8, 2009, Sanchez took an indefinite leave from ''Bandila'' and her [[DZMM]] radio program ''[[Failon Ngayon (radio program)|Tambalang Failon at Sanchez]]'' in anticipation of her wedding to Senator [[Mar Roxas]] and his presidential bid for the 2010 Philippine elections,<ref>{{cite news|title=Korina says wedding day \u2018sooner than later\u2019|date=9 May 2009|publisher=abs-cbnnews.com|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/09/09/korina-says-wedding-day-%E2%80%98sooner-later%E2%80%99|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> leaving Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and Omaga-Diaz as the remaining news anchors, which would serve as a mini-reunion on television after they did the inaugural newscast of [[TV Patrol|TV Patrol Weekend]] in 2004.\n\nAlthough December 31, 2009 fell on Thursday, ''Bandila'' once again failed to air the 2010 New Year Countdown, as a separate Countdown broadcast anchored by [[Bernadette Sembrano]] and Jorge Cari\u00f1o was aired right after the newscast.\n\n===2010 Revamp (2010)===\nA new and improved ''Bandila'' was introduced in time for President-elect [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]]'s [[Inauguration of Benigno Aquino III|inauguration]], on June 30, 2010. This includes the logo, opening billboard, and studio setup that will accommodate augmented reality technology. This was the first time that ''[[TV Patrol]]'' and ''Bandila'' shared a common studio set-up.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon era (2010\u20132011)===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the appointment of outgoing ''[[TV Patrol]]'' anchors [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]] to ''Bandila''. Their arrival to the late-night newscast was scheduled to November 8, but was postponed when Babao was on a vacation that time. Instead, ''Bandila'' was given a new and enhanced studio set, which was exclusively done for ''TV Patrol''.\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Babao and Davila finally arrived to the newscast, replacing Omaga-Diaz who decided to return on field reporting.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/bandila/11/19/10/karen-julius-join-ces-bandila</ref> The same night, the program updated its graphics, opening billboard, and title card. ''Bandila'' started letting viewers send their reactions on each news through [[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]] and later read by the anchors after each news items, thus making ''Bandila'' more interactive.\n\nSanchez (from being one of the program's original news anchors) was moved to ''TV Patrol'' in turn. The addition of Babao and Davila in ''Bandila'' falsified the rumor that they will leave ABS-CBN and transfer to a different TV network after being \"removed\" from ''TV Patrol''.\n\n''Bandila'' covered the 2011 New Year Countdown Special, with Babao and Davila anchoring it from [[Luneta Park]], [[Manila]]. This was the third time the newscast covered the New Year Countdown; the first two being at the beginning of 2008 and 2009.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, ''Bandila'' stopped its delayed simulcast over [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]] in preparation for the DZMM schedule revamps that occurred three days later, leaving ''TV Patrol'' as the only TV program to simulcast on DZMM. It was later returned on-air as a standalone early edition which began on April 17, 2017 at 10:00PM, airing exclusively on the two stations before its main edition on ABS-CBN.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, ''Bandila'' launched its [https://archive.is/20130120223643/http://bandila.abs-cbnnews.com/ official webpage] as its additional online citizen journalism site.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon-Abunda era (2011\u20132014)===\nOn October 3, 2011, ''Bandila'' moved to an earlier timeslot with the addition of [[Boy Abunda]] as one of the anchors, upon which it focuses on entertainment. This resulted in updating their title card and a new opening billboard. Another innovation for the newscast is by sending reactions through text messaging. Another addition is the segments ''Trending Balita'' (which focuses on different showbiz personalities) and the popular ''Ikaw Na!'' (where Boy Abunda interviews showbiz personalities.)\n\nOn July 29, 2013, ''Bandila'', alongside ''[[TV Patrol]]'', changed their idents and looks, which was first revealed on their official Facebook account. The ''Bandila'' font logo was also replaced from [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]].\n\nOn February 7, 2014, Boy Abunda left the news program to host the late-night talk show ''[[Aquino & Abunda Tonight]]''.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon era (2014\u20132017)===\nOn February 10, 2014, the original ''Bandila'' 2013 opening billboard (OBB) was updated to show the three remaining news anchors prior to Abunda's exit, which was used until May 9, 2014. This time, the opening of the title card is animated in flag form. On May 12, 2014, the news program's OBB and graphics its segments were updated again.\n\nFrom June 25 to July 3, 2016, the main studio for ''[[TV Patrol]]'' and ''Bandila'' underwent major renovations, resulting in both programs to temporarily broadcast on the newsroom of ABS-CBN News.\n\nOn July 4, 2016, ''Bandila'' and ''TV Patrol'' revamped its opening billboards, graphics, lower thirds and ticker; while the logos for both programs remained the same (except that the logo for ''Bandila'' now uses [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]] typeface), the logos were presented in a 3D-like format. Both programs are also broadcast in a newly-renovated set, which includes a large screen display and green chroma set. The revamp coincides the 10th anniversary of ''Bandila''.\n\nOn April 17, 2017, ''Bandila'' returned to DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo while undergoing programming changes. It became a standalone broadcast and premiered at 10:00 PM, while the main edition on ABS-CBN will be retained unlike prior to 2011 when it was simulcasted on a slightly-delayed basis. The simulcast ended on May 20, 2019.\n\n===Babao-Davila era (2017\u20132020)===\nOn December 21, 2017, Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon announced that she will be leaving ''Bandila'' to focus on her new position in the network as \"lifestyle content head\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/12/22/17/watch-ces-orea-drilon-bids-bandila-goodbye|title=WATCH: Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon bids 'Bandila' goodbye|website=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> On December 25, 2017, the current ''Bandila'' 2016 OBB was still used showing the three news anchors prior to Drilon's exit. Few days after, the opening billboard becomes shortened to exclude Drilon.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' (along with the other news programs of ABS-CBN) has finally switched to high definition ([[1080i]], [[16:9]] [[HDTV]]) format, with a temporary background music replacing the news program's theme song \"''Isang Bandila''\". \n\nOn July 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' launched its new original theme song, entitled simply \"''Bandila''\", performed by [[Ebe Dancel]].\n\nOn April 21, 2019, the program temporarily transferred back to the ABS-CBN Newsroom when Studio 7 is being prepared for the coverage of [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 midterm election]] (titled as ''Halalan 2019''.) The newscast then returned to the newly renovated studio on May 13, 2019 during the election coverage, while retaining the current OBB, logo and graphics since 2016, and its theme song since 2018.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Bandila was temporarily replaced by the replay of ''[[TV Patrol]]'' on its timeslot as provisional programming due to the curfew caused by the quarantine done to reduce the spread of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|pandemic in the Philippines]]. Later on March 30, Bandila was temporarily replaced by Mission Possible on Mondays, My Puhunan on Tuesdays, #NoFilter on Wednesdays, Sports U on Thursdays, and Local Legends on Fridays wherein these programs are aired on the show\u2019s timeslot as provisional programming.\n\n==Format==\n===Original format===\nThe original format of ''Bandila'' features Sanchez situated in the news studio, while Drilon and Diaz situating in the newsroom, which the similar style on Korina-era ''TV Patrol''. The newscast begins with the segment \"''Sa Mga Balitang Bumabandila''\" (lit. In The Waving News) that discusses the top stories of the day. Usually, Sanchez would start the program by saying \"sa mga balitang bumabandila.\" This tagline was used by Drilon upon departure of Sanchez in 2009 and this continued until 2010, after which, Julius Babao would said it at the start of the newscast. In 2011, that tagline would only be said upon the start of headlines. Other segments include \"''Patok!''\" (lit. Popular) that sets aside serious news and discusses other features and news that do not deal with politics and public affairs on a lighter note.\n\n===2010 format===\nThe addition of Julius Babao and Karen Davila to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added a desk which allows better interaction shots and more discussions especially now that the newscast strengthens their [[citizen journalism]] campaign. The major change in the current format is the addition of [[interactivity]], which now lets television viewers send in their reactions to each news through the use of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items. The anchors also survey the people occasionally by asking a question that deals with one of the news stories (e.g. \"What are you going to do if you won the lottery?\").\n\n===2011 format===\nThe addition of Boy Abunda to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added another desk separate from the desk used by the three news anchors. The major change in the current format is the addition of sending their reaction through text messaging also through [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items.\n\n===Current format===\nOn May 12, 2014, the program introduced new segments such as \"''Selfie Balita''\" (wherein viewers could tape and record their own reports), \"''Yes or No''\" (wherein the anchors will interview a guest about current issues and then ask them, together with the viewers, with questions answerable only with Yes or No), and \"''Tatak Noypi''\" (wherein Tony Velasquez reports about the unusual and unique characteristics of the Filipino people.) These segments have been discontinued in 2016.\n\n==Anchors==\n===Main anchors===\n*[[Julius Babao]] <small>(2010\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Karen Davila]] <small>(2010\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former anchors===\n*[[Korina Sanchez]] <small>(main anchor, 2006\u20132009; returned to ''[[TV Patrol]]'' from 2010 to 2015)</small> \n*[[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] <small>(main anchor, 2006\u20132010; currently relief anchor for Babao)</small>\n*[[Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon]] <small>(main anchor, 2006\u20132017)</small>\n*[[Boy Abunda]] <small>(2011-2014; ''Ikaw Na!'' anchor)</small>\n*Tony Velasquez <small>(2014\u20132016; ''Tatak Noypi'' anchor)</small>\n\n==Theme music==\n''Bandila''{{'}}s primary theme song was \"''Isang Bandila''\" ({{literal translation|One Flag}}) by [[Rivermaya]], which was released as part of the band's album ''Isang Ugat, Isang Dugo'' ({{literal translation|One Origin, One Blood}}).

The theme song was used from 2006 until 2018.\n\nOn its twelfth anniversary in 2018, ''Bandila'' decided to adopt a new theme song in order to \"attract younger audiences.\" The new theme music is simply called \"''Bandila''\", an original song performed by [[Ebe Dancel]].

During the pilot episode, it aired a video of General [[Danilo Lim]] organizing a coup d'\u00e9tat against former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].\n\n[[Maria Ressa]], then-head of [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]], explained ''Bandila'' as \"three colors, three stars, three anchors\"<ref name=ban>{{cite news|title=Kapamilya revamps late-night newscast|date=17 June 2006|publisher=inquirer.net|url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20060617-5297}}</ref> referring that of the [[Philippine flag]] having three colors. On the other hand, [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]], then head of Current Affairs, said that the title also depicts the news as \"banner stories\".<ref name=ban /> They also said that they choose three anchors for the late-night newscast as referring to the three stars in the Philippine flag, and chooses Sanchez, Omaga-Diaz and Ore\u00f1a-Drilon as the news anchors because they are the three of the most seasoned and experienced broadcast journalist in the network.\n\nDuring this period, ''Bandila'' covered the New Year Countdown for 2008 and 2009, after failing to air the 2007 New Year Countdown when New Year's Eve of 2006 fell on Sunday as ''Bandila'' airs on Monday-Friday.\n\n===Diaz-Drilon era (2009\u20132010)===\nOn May 8, 2009, Sanchez took an indefinite leave from ''Bandila'' and her [[DZMM]] radio program ''[[Failon Ngayon (radio program)|Tambalang Failon at Sanchez]]'' in anticipation of her wedding to Senator [[Mar Roxas]] and his presidential bid for the 2010 Philippine elections,<ref>{{cite news|title=Korina says wedding day \u2018sooner than later\u2019|date=9 May 2009|publisher=abs-cbnnews.com|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/09/09/korina-says-wedding-day-%E2%80%98sooner-later%E2%80%99|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> leaving Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and Omaga-Diaz as the remaining news anchors, which would serve as a mini-reunion on television after they did the inaugural newscast of [[TV Patrol|TV Patrol Weekend]] in 2004.\n\nAlthough December 31, 2009 fell on Thursday, ''Bandila'' once again failed to air the 2010 New Year Countdown, as a separate Countdown broadcast anchored by [[Bernadette Sembrano]] and Jorge Cari\u00f1o was aired right after the newscast.\n\n===2010 Revamp (2010)===\nA new and improved ''Bandila'' was introduced in time for President-elect [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]]'s [[Inauguration of Benigno Aquino III|inauguration]], on June 30, 2010. This includes the logo, opening billboard, and studio setup that will accommodate augmented reality technology. This was the first time that ''[[TV Patrol]]'' and ''Bandila'' shared a common studio set-up.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon era (2010\u20132011)===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the appointment of outgoing ''[[TV Patrol]]'' anchors [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]] to ''Bandila''. Their arrival to the late-night newscast was scheduled to November 8, but was postponed when Babao was on a vacation that time. Instead, ''Bandila'' was given a new and enhanced studio set, which was exclusively done for ''TV Patrol''.\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Babao and Davila finally arrived to the newscast, replacing Omaga-Diaz who decided to return on field reporting.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/bandila/11/19/10/karen-julius-join-ces-bandila</ref> The same night, the program updated its graphics, opening billboard, and title card. ''Bandila'' started letting viewers send their reactions on each news through [[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]] and later read by the anchors after each news items, thus making ''Bandila'' more interactive.\n\nSanchez (from being one of the program's original news anchors) was moved to ''TV Patrol'' in turn. The addition of Babao and Davila in ''Bandila'' falsified the rumor that they will leave ABS-CBN and transfer to a different TV network after being \"removed\" from ''TV Patrol''.\n\n''Bandila'' covered the 2011 New Year Countdown Special, with Babao and Davila anchoring it from [[Luneta Park]], [[Manila]]. This was the third time the newscast covered the New Year Countdown; the first two being at the beginning of 2008 and 2009.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, ''Bandila'' stopped its delayed simulcast over [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]] in preparation for the DZMM schedule revamps that occurred three days later, leaving ''TV Patrol'' as the only TV program to simulcast on DZMM. It was later returned on-air as a standalone early edition which began on April 17, 2017 at 10:00PM, airing exclusively on the two stations before its main edition on ABS-CBN.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, ''Bandila'' launched its [https://archive.is/20130120223643/http://bandila.abs-cbnnews.com/ official webpage] as its additional online citizen journalism site.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon-Abunda era (2011\u20132014)===\nOn October 3, 2011, ''Bandila'' moved to an earlier timeslot with the addition of [[Boy Abunda]] as one of the anchors, upon which it focuses on entertainment. This resulted in updating their title card and a new opening billboard. Another innovation for the newscast is by sending reactions through text messaging. Another addition is the segments ''Trending Balita'' (which focuses on different showbiz personalities) and the popular ''Ikaw Na!'' (where Boy Abunda interviews showbiz personalities.)\n\nOn July 29, 2013, ''Bandila'', alongside ''[[TV Patrol]]'', changed their idents and looks, which was first revealed on their official Facebook account. The ''Bandila'' font logo was also replaced from [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]].\n\nOn February 7, 2014, Boy Abunda left the news program to host the late-night talk show ''[[Aquino & Abunda Tonight]]''.\n\n===Babao-Davila-Drilon era (2014\u20132017)===\nOn February 10, 2014, the original ''Bandila'' 2013 opening billboard (OBB) was updated to show the three remaining news anchors prior to Abunda's exit, which was used until May 9, 2014. This time, the opening of the title card is animated in flag form. On May 12, 2014, the news program's OBB and graphics its segments were updated again.\n\nFrom June 25 to July 3, 2016, the main studio for ''[[TV Patrol]]'' and ''Bandila'' underwent major renovations, resulting in both programs to temporarily broadcast on the newsroom of ABS-CBN News.\n\nOn July 4, 2016, ''Bandila'' and ''TV Patrol'' revamped its opening billboards, graphics, lower thirds and ticker; while the logos for both programs remained the same (except that the logo for ''Bandila'' now uses [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]] typeface), the logos were presented in a 3D-like format. Both programs are also broadcast in a newly-renovated set, which includes a large screen display and green chroma set. The revamp coincides the 10th anniversary of ''Bandila''.\n\nOn April 17, 2017, ''Bandila'' returned to DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo while undergoing programming changes. It became a standalone broadcast and premiered at 10:00 PM, while the main edition on ABS-CBN will be retained unlike prior to 2011 when it was simulcasted on a slightly-delayed basis. The simulcast ended on May 20, 2019.\n\n===Babao-Davila era (2017\u2013present)===\nOn December 21, 2017, Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon announced that she will be leaving ''Bandila'' to focus on her new position in the network as \"lifestyle content head\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/12/22/17/watch-ces-orea-drilon-bids-bandila-goodbye|title=WATCH: Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon bids 'Bandila' goodbye|website=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> On December 25, 2017, the current ''Bandila'' 2016 OBB was still used showing the three news anchors prior to Drilon's exit. Few days after, the opening billboard becomes shortened to exclude Drilon.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' (along with the other news programs of ABS-CBN) has finally switched to high definition ([[1080i]], [[16:9]] [[HDTV]]) format, with a temporary background music replacing the news program's theme song \"''Isang Bandila''\". \n\nOn July 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' launched its new original theme song, entitled simply \"''Bandila''\", performed by [[Ebe Dancel]].\n\nOn April 21, 2019, the program temporarily transferred back to the ABS-CBN Newsroom when Studio 7 is being prepared for the coverage of [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 midterm election]] (titled as ''Halalan 2019''.) The newscast then returned to the newly renovated studio on May 13, 2019 during the election coverage, while retaining the current OBB, logo and graphics since 2016, and its theme song since 2018.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Bandila was temporarily replaced by the replay of ''[[TV Patrol]]'' on its timeslot as provisional programming due to the curfew caused by the quarantine done to reduce the spread of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|pandemic in the Philippines]]. Later on March 30, Bandila was temporarily replaced by Mission Possible on Mondays, My Puhunan on Tuesdays, #NoFilter on Wednesdays, Sports U on Thursdays, and Local Legends on Fridays wherein these programs are aired on the show\u2019s timeslot as provisional programming.\n\n==Format==\n===Original format===\nThe original format of ''Bandila'' features Sanchez situated in the news studio, while Drilon and Diaz situating in the newsroom, which the similar style on Korina-era ''TV Patrol''. The newscast begins with the segment \"''Sa Mga Balitang Bumabandila''\" (lit. In The Waving News) that discusses the top stories of the day. Usually, Sanchez would start the program by saying \"sa mga balitang bumabandila.\" This tagline was used by Drilon upon departure of Sanchez in 2009 and this continued until 2010, after which, Julius Babao would said it at the start of the newscast. In 2011, that tagline would only be said upon the start of headlines. Other segments include \"''Patok!''\" (lit. Popular) that sets aside serious news and discusses other features and news that do not deal with politics and public affairs on a lighter note.\n\n===2010 format===\nThe addition of Julius Babao and Karen Davila to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added a desk which allows better interaction shots and more discussions especially now that the newscast strengthens their [[citizen journalism]] campaign. The major change in the current format is the addition of [[interactivity]], which now lets television viewers send in their reactions to each news through the use of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items. The anchors also survey the people occasionally by asking a question that deals with one of the news stories (e.g. \"What are you going to do if you won the lottery?\").\n\n===2011 format===\nThe addition of Boy Abunda to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added another desk separate from the desk used by the three news anchors. The major change in the current format is the addition of sending their reaction through text messaging also through [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items.\n\n===Current format===\nOn May 12, 2014, the program introduced new segments such as \"''Selfie Balita''\" (wherein viewers could tape and record their own reports), \"''Yes or No''\" (wherein the anchors will interview a guest about current issues and then ask them, together with the viewers, with questions answerable only with Yes or No), and \"''Tatak Noypi''\" (wherein Tony Velasquez reports about the unusual and unique characteristics of the Filipino people.)
