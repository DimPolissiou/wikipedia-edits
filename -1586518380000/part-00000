In the years up to 1963 the line saw very infrequent service, and mostly carried livestock, sugar beet, and turf, as well as private excursions.

There was also a turntable basin located just behind the engine sheds, formed into the side of the hill with a 30' circular retaining wall on two sides, allowing engines to run in be turned and run out. Locally the town municipal water supply was highly chlorinated and at times impossible to drink. After the station was closed and the turntable was removed a spring in the turntable basin provided fresh water, and was known locally as \"Coughlin's well! \". It continued to be used into the 1980s with Offaly County Council maintaining this site for a while.

With no through running for scheduled passenger traffic, it was considered a branch or slip line.

I Nearly Bought One!'', was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs \"Change\" and \"Wardance\" remixed by Youth, who was by then a successful producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/youth-killing-joke-paul-mccartney|title=Youth: From Killing Joke to Paul McCartney|website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' was released in 1994 on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, featuring a heavy and diverse new style. [[Tom Larkin]], of New Zealand band [[Shihad]],  performed drums on the album. Coleman had earlier produced Shihad's 1993 debut album, but relations later soured due to a dispute over Coleman's producer's fee. ''Pandemonium'' also featured several Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on ''Songs from the Victorious City'', including percussionist [[Hossam Ramzy]] and violinist Aboud Abdel Al.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pandemonium-mw0000119138|title=Pandemonium - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/|title=Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!}}</ref>, and earned Killing Joke a memorable ''Top of the Pops'' appearance for the single \"Millennium\", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20).

''Democracy'' introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on ''Democracy'' and ''XXV Gathering''.

First on board was drummer [[Martin Atkins]], who had gained notability in Public Image Ltd. A suitable bass player proved more difficult. Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] member [[Andy Rourke]] was hired, then dismissed after only three days.

He was replaced by former member Paul Raven and the revised line-up began recording again, this time in London. The result was Killing Joke's eighth album, ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990. It marked a return to a heavier, industrial sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/mar/19/old-music-killing-joke-age-greed|title=Old music: Killing Joke \u2013 Age of Greed|first=Martin|last=Belam|date=19 March 2012|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/extremities-dirt-and-various-repressed-emotions-mw0000311317|title=Extremities, Dirt and Various Repressed Emotions - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> \"[[Money Is Not Our God]]\" was the lead single.

That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs \"Change\" and \"Wardance\" remixed by Youth, who was by then a successful producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/youth-killing-joke-paul-mccartney|title=Youth: From Killing Joke to Paul McCartney|website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' was released in 1994 on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, featuring a heavy and diverse new style. [[Tom Larkin]], of New Zealand band [[Shihad]],  performed drums on the album. Coleman had earlier produced Shihad's 1993 debut album, but relations later soured due to a dispute over Coleman's producer's fee. ''Pandemonium'' also featured several Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on ''Songs from the Victorious City'', including percussionist [[Hossam Ramzy]] and violinist Aboud Abdel Al.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pandemonium-mw0000119138|title=Pandemonium - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/|title=Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!}}</ref>, and earned Killing Joke a memorable ''Top of the Pops'' appearance for the single \"Millennium\", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20).

''Democracy'' introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on ''Democracy'' and ''XXV Gathering''.

The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.\n\nIn February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, [[Sack Trick]]), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]].

It also appears in the flags of \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\".\n\nIn the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" symbol, the twelve rays of the white [[Sun]] representing the twelve [[month]]s and the twelve traditional [[Chinese hour]]s ({{zh|t=\u6642\u8fb0|p=sh\u00edchen|labels=no}}), each of which corresponds to two modern hours and symbolizes the spirit of progress.\n\n==History of the Blue Sky White Sun design==\n\nThe \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was originally designed by [[Lu Haodong|Lu Hao-tung]], a martyr of the [[Xinhai Revolution|Republican revolution]]. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the [[Society for Regenerating China]], an anti-[[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] society in [[Hong Kong]], on February 21, 1895.\n\nDuring the [[Wuchang Uprising]] in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was used in the provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Guizhou]], while the \"[[18-Star Flag]]\", \"[[Five-Colored Flag]]\", and other designs were used elsewhere.\n\nWhen the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, The \"Five-Colored\" flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917, he brought over the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag for the party and the \"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\" ({{zh|t=\u9751\u5929\u767d\u65e5\u6eff\u5730\u7d05|labels=no}}) flag, which was then the naval ensign, for the nation. This officially became the [[flag of the Republic of China|national flag]] in 1928 while the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was adopted as the naval jack.\n\nThe \"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\" flag has remained the [[flag of the Republic of China]]  to this day.\n\n== National emblem and history ==\n{{Main|Twelve Symbols national emblem}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Symbols national emblem of China.svg|left|200px|thumb|[[Twelve Symbols national emblem]], national emblem of the [[Beiyang Government|Republic of China]] (1913\u20131928) and the [[Empire of China (1915\u20131916)|Empire of China]] (1915\u20131916).]]\n\nThe national emblem of the Republic of China was derived from the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. The emblem was designed by [[He Yingqin]] at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924 and was set as the national emblem by the ''Law of national flag and national emblem of the Republic of China'' in 1928.\n\nOn the national emblem rays of sun have some distance to the edge, symbolizing the broadness of the sky, while on Kuomintang emblem the rays reach the edge, symbolizing the spirit of revolution is as powerful as the sun.\n\nThe national emblem of the Republic of China from 1913 to 1928 is called '''[[Twelve Symbols national emblem]]''', based on the traditional symbols on clothes of ancient Chinese emperors. It was designed by [[Lu Xun]], [[Qian Daosun]] and [[Xu Shoushang]] on August 28, 1912 and was set as national emblem in February 1913. It remained as the national emblem during the Empire of China from 1915 to 1916. After the [[Northern Expedition]] it was replaced by the Blue Sky with a White Sun national emblem in 1928.\n\n== Situation during Dang Guo period ==\n[[File:KMT Kaohsiung City Division 20140724.jpg|thumb|left|The KMT and ROC flags displayed at a party building in [[Kaohsiung]].]]\n{{See also|Dang Guo}}\nIn the early years of the Republic, under the KMT's political tutelage, the Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of [[Father of the Nation|National Father]] Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. After the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], the party flag was removed from such displayed and the national flag moved to the center.\n\nSince the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of [[martial law]] the KMT flag has lost some of its  prominence. However, it is still frequently seen on KMT party buildings in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the [[pan-blue coalition]].\n\nThe flag and the KMT party emblem made news during the [[2004 ROC legislative election|ROC legislative elections of 2004]], when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang's flag and party emblem violated the ROC's National Emblem Law for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC's emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the [[pan-green coalition]] failed to win a majority, and Chen took no action for the remainder of his presidency.\n\n==Use in other countries==\nThe design of \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" was used in the unit insignia or coats of arms of some units of the [[United States Army]] that fought in [[World War II]]. The most famous unit was [[Merrill's Marauders]] (officially named the \"5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)\"), which has the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" as part of its badge. The usage by American troops was a result of cooperation between US and [[Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma)|Chinese Expeditionary Force]] in the [[China Burma India Theater]]. Postwar US military units stationed in [[Taiwan]], including the [[United States Taiwan Defense Command]] (USTDC) and the [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] (MAAG), also used the design in their badges.\n\nUp to now, the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" can still be seen in the emblem of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]].\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:China Burma India Seal.svg|China Burma India Theater\nFile:Merrills Marauders.svg|Merrill's Marauders\nFile:75th Ranger Regiment coat of arms.png|75th Ranger Regiment\nFile:US MAAG Taiwan Badge.svg|[[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] in Taiwan\nFile:Badge of the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC, 1955-1979).svg|[[United States Taiwan Defense Command]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kuomintang]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Politics of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Chinese Taipei]]\n* [[Emblem of the Communist Party of China]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite news |last = Hong |first = Caroline |date = 2004-11-23 |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/11/23/2003212213 |title = Debate heats up over claims to the sun |newspaper = Taipei Times |page = 3 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category multi|Flags with blue sky and white sun|Coats of arms of Taiwan}}\n* [http://www.kmt.org.tw/ Kuomintang Official Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090805105437/http://www.sac.gov.tw/annualreport/Quarterly156/p7.asp sac.gov.tw:\u672c\u671f\u5c08\u984c\uff1a\u5967\u6703\u6a21\u5f0f]{{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Taiwan topics}}\n{{Coats of arms of Asia}}\n{{Chinese Nationalist Party}}\n\n[[Category:National symbols of the Republic of China]]\n[[Category:National emblems|Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Heraldic charges]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with suns]]\n[[Category:Chinese heraldry]]\n[[Category:Flags of organizations]]\n[[Category:National symbols of China]]\n[[Category:Kuomintang]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name             = Party Emblem of the Kuomintang\n|image            = Emblem of the Kuomintang.svg\n|image_width      = 200\n|color            = navy\n|middle           = \n|middle_width     = \n|middle_caption   = \n|lesser           = \n|lesser_width     = \n|lesser_caption   = \n|image2           = \n|image2_width     =\n|image2_caption   = \n|image9           = \n|image3_width     = \n|image3_caption   = \n|armiger          = Kuomintang\n|year_adopted     =\n|crest            = \n|torse            = \n|shield           = Azure, a sun argent with rays throughout\n|supporters       =  \n|compartment      = \n|motto            = \n|orders           = \n|other_elements   = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use              = \n}}\n\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name             = National Emblem of the Republic of China\n|image            = National Emblem of the Republic of China.svg\n|image_width      = 200\n|middle           = \n|middle_width     = \n|middle_caption   = \n|lesser           = \n|lesser_width     = \n|lesser_caption   = \n|image2           = \n|image2_width     =\n|image2_caption   = \n|image9           = \n|image3_width     = \n|image3_caption   = \n|armiger          = [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]\n|year_adopted     = December 17, 1928\n|crest            = \n|torse            = \n|shield           = Azure, a sun argent\n|supporters       =  \n|compartment      = \n|motto            = \n|orders           = \n|other_elements   = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use              = \n}}\n\n{{Infobox Flag\n| Name = Kuomintang\n| Type = Naval Jack, Party Flag\n| Article = \n| Image = Naval Jack of the Republic of China.svg\n| Nickname = \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag ({{zh|t=\u9752\u5929\u767d\u65e5\u65d7|labels=no}})<br />[[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party flag and the ROC naval jack.\n| Use = \n| Symbol = \n| Proportion = 2:3\n| Adoption = 1895\n| Designer = [[Lu Haodong]]\n| Design =  A white [[Sun]] with twelve rays on blue background.\n}}\n<!--This is not the Coat of arms of Taiwan.

(Tiny Ones Transport Service) who are also the non-stork delivery birds at the corporation in the future which has been burned to the ground.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]].

The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the \"Old Town\". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street.

The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]'', said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjav\u00edk]] meaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjav\u00edk of the South\" would be more appropriate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stoppard|first= Tom|author-link=Tom Stoppard|title=Jumpers|title-link=Jumpers (play)|publisher= Grove Press|date=1972|p= 69}}</ref>\n\nThe city has also been known by several [[List of Latin place names in Britain#Cities and towns in Scotland|Latin names]] such as ''Edinburgum'' while the adjectival forms ''Edinburgensis'' and ''Edinensis'' are used in educational and scientific contexts.<ref name=\"Gr\u00e4sse1909\">{{cite book|last=Gr\u00e4sse|first=Johann Georg Theodor |authorlink=Johann Georg Theodor Gr\u00e4sse|title=Orbis latinus: oder Verzeichnis der wichtigsten lateinischen Orts- und L\u00e4ndernamen|edition=2nd|trans-title=Orbis latinus : or List of the most important latin place and country names|year=1909|publisher=Richard Carl Schmidt|location=Berlin |language=de|title-link=Orbis Latinus|orig-year=1861}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |title=Pharmaceutical Latin Abbreviations |publisher=Herbdatanz.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505111506/http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |archivedate=5 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\n''Edina'' is a late 18th century poetical form used by the Scots poets [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Robert Burns]]. \"Embra\" or \"Embro\" are colloquialisms from the same time,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.purr.demon.co.uk/embro/ |title=Embro, Embro \u2013 the hidden history of Edinburgh in its music |publisher=Purr.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627000502/http://www.purr.demon.co.uk/embro/ |archive-date=27 June 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> as in [[Robert Garioch]]'s ''Embro to the Ploy''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk/makars/garioch/embro.html |title=Makars Literary Tour &#124; Robert Garioch |publisher=Edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703111205/http://www.edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk/makars/garioch/embro.html |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n[[Ben Jonson]] described it as \"Britaine's other eye\",<ref>[http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817133048/http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 |date=17 August 2011 }}.
