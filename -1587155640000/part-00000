Lange used up most of his fortune with alchemy experiments, so their marriage was delayed some years while he avoided his creditors and traveled to Germany to try to find patrons for his work.

They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]]. In [[Zealand]], she lived specifically in Elsinore where she worked primarily on horticulture and healing plants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copenhagen |last2=Gothenburg |title=Sophia Ottesdatter Brahe |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/brahe-sophie-ottesdatter/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |publisher=KvindeLitteraturHistorie P\u00c5 Nettet, 2012. |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> She spent her last years writing up the genealogy of Danish noble families, publishing the first major version in 1626 (there were later additions). Her work is still considered a major source for early history of Danish nobility (Det Kongelige Bibliotek). She died in [[Helsing\u00f8r]] in the year 1643,<ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=264}}</ref> and was buried in the Torrl\u00f6sa old church in the village of Torrl\u00f6sa, east of the town of [[Landskrona]] in what was then Denmark but now is southern Sweden. That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asmu.dk/pub/Download/nyhedsbrev/1.aar/sophie303.pdf|title=Hvem er Sophie|last=Tjornum|first=Gilbert|date=November 11, 2003|website=Astrologisk Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=57}}: 8 December 1573 ... helped Tycho to observe a lunar eclipse</ref> Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSophia frequently visited [[Uraniborg|Uranienborg]], Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hveen]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called [[SN 1572]], as well as observations of the 8 December 1573 lunar eclipse. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the geocentric model of the universe. Sophia's assistance was also instrumental in Tycho's work on orbits, which was foundational to the modern methods used to predict the positions of the planets. Tycho's studies of orbits involved the most precise measurements of the planets' movements made prior to the invention of the telescope, and while Tycho created many of the astronomical devices used to conduct the measurements, Sophia was among the assistants who actually made the measurements.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe (1556 - 1643)|website=National Schools' Observatory|publisher=Liverpool John Moores University|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>  Tycho did have other assistants, however, and while Sophia was present for each of these discoveries, the extent to which she contributed personally is unknown.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

This really shines true during her marriage. Sophia remarries in 1602 to the alchemist Erik Lange. Lange, like many alchemists was striving to change different metal into gold. In the pursuit of this goal Lange, with the support of his wife, spent all of the money that the two had saved. They lived in extreme poverty until Erik Lange passed away. This allowed Brahe to move back with her son in Denmark, who likely supported her financially. Now she could continue her works in science and write the genealogy of Danish noble families.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sophia Brahe (1556 - 1643) |url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe |website=National Schools' Observatory |publisher=Liverpool John Moores University |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Urania Titani==\nUrania Titani was a poem written by Tycho Brahe, the brother of Sophia, about a fictional love correspondence between Sophia and Erik.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Christianson |first1=J.R. |title=TYCHO Brahe in Scandinavian Scholarhip |journal=History of Science |date=1998 |volume=36 |pages=475\u2013476 |doi=10.1177/007327539803600403}}</ref> Tycho wrote the poem in Latin, a language Sophia was not fluent in.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  In the poem, Tycho represents Sophia as [[Urania]], the Muse of astronomy in [[Greek mythology]], and Erik as a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], a son of [[Uranus (mythology)]].<ref name=\"nordicwomensliterature.net\">{{cite web |last1=Alenius |first1=Marianne |title=The Honey-Sweet Delicacies of the Muses |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/2011/07/27/the-honey-sweet-delicacies-of-the-muses/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |accessdate=18 March 2019 |language=English |date=27 July 2011}}</ref> Sophia is depicted as longing for her husband while he studied abroad to study alchemy.<ref name=\"nordicwomensliterature.net\"/> his work established the co-dependence that Sophia and Tycho maintained, including their similar beliefs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Ziggelaar |first1=August |title=Review : Tycho Brahes \"Urania titani\" |journal=ISIS |date=September 1996 |volume=87 |pages=542\u2013543 |doi=10.1086/357600}}</ref> Lastly, the poem was a large indicator of Tycho publicizing his bond with his sister, establishing himself as a [[Renaissance]] man and unashamed of his work with his sister.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Genealogy==\nSophia is known for her work in [[genealogy]].

Tycho Brahe wrote the Latin epic poem \"[[Urania Titani]]\" during the couple's separation, expressed as a letter from his sister Sophia to her fianc\u00e9 in 1594.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\"/> Tycho casts Sophia as Urania, muse of astronomy,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziggelaar|first=August|date=September 1996|title=Reviewed Work: Tycho Brahes \"Urania Titani\": Et digt om Sophie Brahe by Peter Zeeberg|url=|journal=Isis|volume= 87| issue =  3|pages=542\u2013543|doi=10.1086/357600}}</ref> a further suggestion of his respect for her scientific endeavours.\n\nIn 1599, she visited Lange in Hamburg, but they did not marry until 1602 in [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]]. They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]]. In [[Zealand]], she lived specifically in Elsinore where she worked primarily on horticulture and healing plants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copenhagen |last2=Gothenburg |title=Sophia Ottesdatter Brahe |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/brahe-sophie-ottesdatter/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |publisher=KvindeLitteraturHistorie P\u00c5 Nettet, 2012. |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> She spent her last years writing up the genealogy of Danish noble families, publishing the first major version in 1626 (there were later additions).

That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asmu.dk/pub/Download/nyhedsbrev/1.aar/sophie303.pdf|title=Hvem er Sophie|last=Tjornum|first=Gilbert|date=November 11, 2003|website=Astrologisk Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=57}}: 8 December 1573 ... helped Tycho to observe a lunar eclipse</ref> Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSophia frequently visited [[Uraniborg|Uranienborg]], Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hveen]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called [[SN 1572]], as well as observations of the 8 December 1573 lunar eclipse. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the geocentric model of the universe. Sophia's assistance was also instrumental in Tycho's work on orbits, which was foundational to the modern methods used to predict the positions of the planets. Tycho's studies of orbits involved the most precise measurements of the planets' movements made prior to the invention of the telescope, and while Tycho created many of the astronomical devices used to conduct the measurements, Sophia was among the assistants who actually made the measurements.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe (1556 - 1643)|website=National Schools' Observatory|publisher=Liverpool John Moores University|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>  Tycho did have other assistants, however, and while Sophia was present for each of these discoveries, the extent to which she contributed personally is unknown.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

This really shines true during her marriage. Sophia remarries in 1602 to the alchemist Erik Lange. Lange, like many alchemists was striving to change different metal into gold. In the pursuit of this goal Lange, with the support of his wife, spent all of the money that the two had saved. They lived in extreme poverty until Erik Lange passed away. This allowed Brahe to move back with her son in Denmark, who likely supported her financially.

The team won the National League title twice, in {{baseball year|1879}} and {{baseball year|1884}}.  Following the 1884 season, they won the [[1884 World Series|first World Series]] over the [[New York Metropolitans]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]].  The team folded after the {{baseball year|1885}} season.\n\n== Origins and formation ==\n[[File:1879 Providence Grays.jpeg|thumb|300px|1879 National League champion Providence Grays]]\nRhode Island was a hotbed of baseball in the 1870s with several notable amateur clubs along with Brown University's powerhouse collegiate team.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">https://books.google.com/books?id=DLYYVtN7SZ0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA47&output=embed</ref> In 1875, the semi-pro \"Rhode Islands\" were formed. After successful seasons (along with excellent paid attendance) in 1875, 1876, and 1877, the team drew the attention of the recently formed [[National League]]. When the League elected to drop the [[Hartford Dark Blues|Hartford franchise]] after the 1877 season, Providence was awarded a franchise to replace the Connecticut club.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nThe new team was officially organized on January&nbsp;16, 1878 by Benjamin Douglas, who became the team's [[general manager]].  Henry Root was hired as the team president\u201a and [[Tom Carey (shortstop)|Tom Carey]] was initially hired to be the on-field [[captain (sports)|captain]], whose duties were similar to the modern-day [[manager (baseball)|manager]].<ref name=\"1878chrono\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1878|title=Charlton's Baseball Chronology - 1878|year=2006|work=baseballlibrary.com|publisher=The Idea Logical Company, Inc|accessdate=June 4, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920104110/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1878|archivedate=September 20, 2015}}</ref> On January&nbsp;21, 1878, Providence applied for membership in the NL, and was officially approved on February&nbsp;6.<ref name=1878chrono/>  \n\nOn April 10, Root took over ownership of the team, fired Douglas for incompetence and insubordination, and hired [[Tom York (baseball)|Tom York]] to replace Carey as captain.<ref name=1878chrono/><ref name=\"seymour157\">Seymour, p. 157</ref> On May 30, the Providence Base Ball Association was incorporated by the Rhode Island General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOs4AAAAIAAJ|title=At the General Assembly of the State of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Begun and Holden, ... at ...

Construction on the [[Messer Street Grounds]] began on April 1 and took exactly one month to complete; the final nail was hammered a mere five minutes before the opening game got underway on May 1.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n[[1879 in baseball|The following season]] the team installed a screen behind home plate to protect the fans sitting there from injury due to foul balls and [[wild pitch]]es. They were the first team in baseball history to do this; while some fans protested, complaining that they obstructed their view of the game, by the end of the next decade they were commonplace.<ref>J.G.

Evidence is strong but not conclusive: Peter Morris of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] has researched this issue, as reported by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2004.<ref>Black Baseball Pioneer William White's 1879 Game https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1626450</ref>\n\n== 1884 champions ==\n{{Main article|1884 World Series}}\n\n[[File:1884grays.jpg|thumb|300px|1884 National League champion Providence Grays]]\nThe 1884 team was led by ace pitcher [[Charles Radbourn|Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn]] (sometimes spelled Radbourne), who won a record 60 (59, according to some sources) games that year and led the Grays to the pennant. When the team's other star pitcher, [[Charlie Sweeney]], defected to the rival [[Union Association]] league in July, it looked like the Grays' season was doomed, but \"Old Hoss\" offered to pitch the rest of the team's games. The Grays went on a 20-game winning streak and topped the league ahead of their New England rivals, the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Red Stockings]].\n\nAt the close of the season, Providence officials accepted New York Metropolitans (AA) manager [[Jim Mutrie]]'s challenge to a three-game postseason match. All of the games took place at the Polo Grounds in New York and were played under American Association rules, which forbade overhand pitching.<ref name=\"19cbaseball.com\">http://www.19cbaseball.com/players-charles-radbourn.html</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 1884, the Providence Grays (NL) whitewashed the New York Metropolitans (AA), 6\u20130, behind Radbourn, in what is considered to be the first official postseason interleague game. Radbourn allowed two hits and strike out nine. [[Tim Keefe]] was the losing pitcher. The very next day, Radbourn three-hit the Metropolitans and won 3\u20131 in a game called after seven innings due to darkness. Grays third baseman [[Jerry Denny]] hit a three-run homer in the fifth inning. It was the first home run in World Series history. Keefe lost for the second time. On October 25, 1884 the Grays defeated the Metropolitans, 11\u20132, in the final game of the series. Radbourn won for the third time in three days.

Although it is generally more difficult to date Asian sites than African sites because Asian sites typically lack volcanic materials that can be dated isotropically, the age of the tools has been [[stratigraphy|magnetostratigraphically]] dated as 1.36 million years. This method hinges upon dated [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] in the [[Earth's magnetic field]].\n\n==Research==\nThe site was first discovered by the US geologist [[George Brown Barbour|George Barbour]] in 1923.  Barbour invited French archaeologists [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[\u00c9mile Licent]].  In 1935 Teilhard found a stone (flint) tool and determined the age of the site to be over a million years&nbsp;\u2013 it was the oldest artefact then known. Many scientists, including Teilhard, debated whether this tool might not be naturally formed.\n\nThe discovery by [[Pei Wenzhong]] of [[Peking Man]] hundreds of kilometers to the south (followed by wars and revolution) distracted the attention of the world's scientific community.

Although it is generally more difficult to date Asian sites than African sites because Asian sites typically lack volcanic materials that can be dated isotropically, the age of the tools has been [[stratigraphy|magnetostratigraphically]] dated as 1.36 million years. This method hinges upon dated [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] in the [[Earth's magnetic field]].\n\n==Research==\nThe site was first discovered by the US geologist [[George Brown Barbour|George Barbour]] in 1923.  Barbour invited French archaeologists [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[\u00c9mile Licent]].  In 1935 Teilhard found a stone (flint) tool and determined the age of the site to be over a million years&nbsp;\u2013 it was the oldest artefact then known. Many scientists, including Teilhard, debated whether this tool might not be naturally formed.\n\nThe discovery by [[Pei Wenzhong]] of [[Peking Man]] hundreds of kilometers to the south (followed by wars and revolution) distracted the attention of the world's scientific community.  However, from 1972 to 1978 more than 2000 pieces of stone tools were discovered, together with some bone tools, which confirmed Xiaochangliang (or [[Nihewan]]) as a paleolithic site.\n\nIn 1982, [[Wei Qi]], then 44, found a huge hominid settlement at [[Donggutuo Village]].
