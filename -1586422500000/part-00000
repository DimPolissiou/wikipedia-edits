Sayers]]'s ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' and is used to help elicit the criminal's motive.\n\n==''The Two Cultures''==\n{{Main|The Two Cultures}}\n\nOn 7 May 1959, Snow delivered a [[Rede Lecture]] called ''[[The Two Cultures]]'', which provoked \"widespread and heated debate\".<ref name=Columbia/> Subsequently, published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'', the lecture argued that the breakdown of communication between the \"two cultures\" of modern society \u2013 the sciences and the humanities \u2013 was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems. In particular, Snow argues that the quality of education in the world is on the decline. He wrote:\n\n::A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: 'Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?'\n\n::I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question \u2013 such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, 'Can you read?' \u2013 not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their [[Neolithic]] ancestors would have had.\n\nThe satirists [[Flanders and Swann]] used the first part of this quotation as the basis for their short monologue and song, \"First and Second Law\".\n\nAs delivered in 1959, Snow's Rede Lectures specifically condemned the British educational system, as having since the Victorian period over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific education. He believed that in practice this deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation for managing the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled those countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and social class) and those of competing countries.\n\n==Works==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name=Coat of arms of The Lord Snow\n|shield = Azure a semy of snow crystals Proper.\n|crest = A telescope fesswise between two pens in saltire Proper.\n|supporters = On either side a Siamese Cat Proper.\n|motto = Aut Inveniam Viam Aut Faciam <ref>{{cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage |date=1973}}</ref>}}\n===Fiction===\n\n====''Strangers and Brothers'' series====\n{{main|Strangers and Brothers}}\n*''[[George Passant]]'' (first published as ''Strangers and Brothers''), 1940\n*''[[The Light and the Dark]]'', 1947\n*''[[Time of Hope]]'', 1949\n*''[[The Masters (novel)|The Masters]]'', 1951\n*''[[The New Men]]'', 1954\n*''[[Homecomings (novel)|Homecomings]]'', 1956\n*''[[The Conscience of the Rich]]'', 1958\n*''[[The Affair (1960 novel)|The Affair]]'', 1959\n*''[[Corridors of Power (novel)|Corridors of Power]]'', 1964\n*''[[The Sleep of Reason (1968 novel)|The Sleep of Reason]]'', 1968\n*''[[Last Things (novel)|Last Things]]'', 1970\n\n====Other fiction====\n*''Death Under Sail'', 1932\n*''New Lives for Old'', 1933\n*''The Search'', 1934\n*''The Malcontents'', 1972\n*''In Their Wisdom'', 1974, shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]]\n*''A Coat of Varnish'', 1979\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''[[The Two Cultures|The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', 1959\n*''Science and Government'', 1961\n*''[[The Two Cultures|The Two Cultures and a Second Look]]'', 1963\n*''Variety of men'', 1967\n*''The State of Siege'', 1968\n*''Public Affairs'', 1971\n*''Trollope: His Life and Art'', 1975\n*''The Realists'', 1978\n*''The Physicists'', 1981\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''C P Snow and the struggle of Modernity''.
