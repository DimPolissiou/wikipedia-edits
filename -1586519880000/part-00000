He is commonly known as '''Frank Bainimarama''' and sometimes by the chief title ''[[Ratu]].'' He was a naval officer and commander of the Fijian Military Forces.\n\nBainimarama attended [[Marist Brothers High School, Fiji|Marist Brothers High School]], [[Asian Institute of Technology]] and [[Dalhousie University]]. He joined the Fijian Navy in 1975 and rose through the ranks becoming an [[Able Seaman (rank)|Able Seaman]] and a [[Midshipman]] in 1976 ,an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in 1977 and later promoted to a [[sub-lieutenant]] at the end of that year. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander|lieutenant-commander]] in 1986 and became the [[commanding officer]] and a [[commander]] of the Fijian navy in 1988, he later became [[captain]] in 1991. In 1997, Bainimarama was appointed [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]]. In 1998, he was promoted to a [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] becoming the Commander of the Armed Forces in 1999.\n\nBainimarama was the instigator of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|2006 coup]] who removed Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] from power, restoring [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] as president and himself as prime minister. He held this title until the 2014 election where his [[FijiFirst|Fiji First Party]] won and was sworn in as Prime Minister of Fiji by President [[Epeli Nailatikau|Ratu Epeli Nailatikau]]. In the [[2018 Fijian general election]] his [[FijiFirst]] Party won again an outright majority and Bainimarama was sworn-in as the Fijian Prime Minister for a second term on 20 November 2018.\n\n== Background ==\nBainimarama has taken power twice in Fiji's history, the first time as [[Head of State of Fiji|Head of the Interim Military Government]] of [[Fiji]] from 29 May to 13 July 2000, after organising a counter-coup to neutralise the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|ethnic Fijian putsch]] led by [[George Speight]]. He handed power over to the newly appointed [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Josefa Iloilo|Ratu Josefa Iloilo]]. He was instrumental in the rise to power of the government of the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], [[Laisenia Qarase]], but his intense criticism of the government's policy of showing leniency towards persons implicated in the coup later strained his relations with the regime, and on 5 December 2006, he overthrew the Qarase government and announced that he had \"reluctantly\" assumed the powers of the presidency. He restored [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] to the Presidency on 4 January 2007,<ref>AP (2006).

For 56 days Prime Minister [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and most of his cabinet, along with many parliamentarians and their staff, were held as hostages while Speight attempted to negotiate with the President, [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], who denounced the coup and declared a state of emergency.\n\nBelieving that President Kamisese Mara was not dealing effectively with the situation, Bainimarama apparently forced Mara to resign on 29 May 2000, in what some politicians have since called \"a coup within a coup,\" and formed an interim military government, which negotiated an accord under which the rebels would release all hostages, including the deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and would surrender without penalty.  The government later reneged on the last part of the agreement and arrested Speight on 27 July 2000, with Bainimarama saying that he had signed that part of the accord \"under duress.\"\n\n=== Post-2000 coup ===\nBainimarama attended a Leadership and Change Management course with the Public Service Training and Development program in February 2002, and a Policy Planning Analysis and Management course at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in [[Suva]] the following month.  He went on to attend the Defence and Strategic Studies Annual Conference at the [[Australian Defence College]] in [[Canberra]] on 2 August, and the Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]] from 18 to 30 August. In November that year, he was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]], but this promotion was reverted to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] on 1 February 2003.\n\nOn 4 September 2003, Bainimarama attended the [[Pacific Armies Management Seminar XXVII]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], and went on to attend the PKO Capacity Building Seminar in the [[Philippines|Philippine]] capital of [[Manila]].\n\nDespite his deteriorating relationship with the government, Bainimarama was reappointed Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces on 5 February 2004.  That month, he attended the Pacific Area Special Operations Conference.  This was followed by the Seminar Executive Course at the [[Asia Pacific Centre for Strategic Studies]] in [[Hawaii]] in April.  In May and June, he attended the [[South East Asia]] Security Symposium.  In September, he attended both the [[PAMS XXVII]] in the [[India]]n capital of [[New Delhi]], and the 7th Chief of Defence Conference in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].\n\nOn 14 December 2005, Bainimarama began an official visit to China, at the invitation of the [[People's Liberation Army]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Political controversies ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2011}}\n{{Main|2005\u201306 Fijian political crisis|2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\nBainimarama, who initially kept a high profile after the coup, later became embroiled in constant controversy.  He repeatedly entered the political arena to criticise government policy \u2013 especially its policy of leniency, as he saw it, towards persons responsible for the coup.  Politicians countered with charges of inappropriate interference in political affairs, and some accused him of hypocrisy, saying that he himself had a case to answer for his role in Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's resignation from the presidency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nBainimarama condemned the early release of persons imprisoned for their involvement in the 2000 coup, including former [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Jope Seniloli|Ratu Jope Seniloli]] and [[Naiqama Lalabalavu|Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu]], the [[Tui Cakau|Paramount Chief]] of the [[Tovata|Tovata Confederacy]].  He spoke out against the organising of [[Fiji Week, 2004|Fiji Week]], a week of religious services and cultural ceremonies, in which persons could apologise for their participation in the coup, that was held from 4 to 11 October 2004.  On 13 May 2005, he announced his implacable opposition to the government's proposal to establish a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]], with the power to grant compensation to victims of the 2000 coup, and amnesty to perpetrators of it.  He agreed with detractors who called it a sham to grant amnesty to supporters of the government who had played roles in the coup.  His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and June and into July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 11 July, Bainimarama issued one of his strongest-worded challenges yet to the government, saying that it was forcing the country into the same anarchy as in 2000. In an eight-page statement, he warned that the Military would take decisive action against any \"destabilisers\" \u2013 among whom he named Attorney-General Bale and Ministry of Reconciliation Chief Executive [[Apisalome Tudreu]].  ''\"The military will dish out the same fate we dealt George Speight and his group to anyone whom we think deserves this treatment,\"'' Bainimarama said.  He said that he would arrest and put on trial anyone who threatened the stability of Fiji.  The next day, it was revealed that a draft document signed by Bainimarama had originally contained a direct threat to overthrow the government if the bill went through.  ''\"The RFMF must stop the Bill from passing or get rid of the Government if it is passed. We can recover without this government, we cannot recover from this Bill,\"'' said part of an emboldened paragraph, which was edited out of the document, part of the Military's draft submission to the parliamentary committee considering the bill, before publication.  The document accused Prime Minister Qarase and Attorney-General Bale of playing the [[race card]] deliberately for political reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nHome Affairs Minister Vosanibola finally admitted on 13 July that the government was [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutionally]] powerless to do anything to discipline the Military commander.  He said that the government was very concerned about Bainimarama's behaviour, and accused the media of exacerbating the tensions.  ''\"You (the media) can play a major role and come to us first instead of coming to us after highlighting what he (Bainimarama) has said,\"'' Vosanibola told the Fiji Times.  On 20 July, however, Bainimarama claimed that Vosanibola had attempted to dismiss him in June.  Vosanibola had presented a letter of termination to the government, which they had discussed, he claimed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 24 August, Bainimarama went public with allegations that [[Senate of Fiji|Senator]] [[Apisai Tora]] and other politicians, whom he did not name, had asked him to depose President Iloilo in 2000.  Tora angrily denied the accusations, and was supported by Prime Minister Qarase, who claimed to have attended the meeting where the topic of removing President Iloilo was alleged to have come up.  No such topic was discussed, Qarase said.  Bainimarama reiterated his allegations on 1 September, and police spokeswoman [[Sylvia Low]] said that a file had, in fact, been opened as far back as 2001, when Bainimarama had made a statement to the police naming individuals he said were involved in the plot.  That file was still open, Low said.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 5 September, a team of Criminal Investigation Officers interviewed Bainimarama about his allegations.  The details of the discussion were not disclosed, except that Bainimarama had filed an official statement.  He told the media after the meeting that he was willing to testify in court.  Earlier, Kevueli Bulamainaivalu, the police officer heading the investigation, had said on 29 August that until Commodore Bainimarama had filed an official report and signed it, the police could do nothing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nBainimarama's detractors accused him of hypocrisy for vehemently opposing what he saw as the government's policy of leniency towards perpetrators of the 2000 coup, when there were unanswered questions about his own role in it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 25 April 2004, then-[[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] [[Mick Beddoes]] called on the army to answer for its failure to protect President Mara while the country was in crisis.  He called this ''\"a fundamental failure\"'' on the part of the army.  On 5 January 2005, [[Joji Kotobalavu]], a spokesman for Prime Minister Qarase, reminded the public that Bainimarama himself was currently under investigation for his role in the apparently forced resignation of President Mara.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 2 May 2005, Police Commissioner [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]] announced that Bainimarama had volunteered to make a statement about his own role in Mara's resignation.  To lay any charges, Hughes had earlier said, it would have to be proven that Bainimarama actually forced the President to resign.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Bougainville security situation ===\n{{Main|Fijian mercenaries in Bougainville}}\n\nBainimarama told the [[Fiji Live]] news service on 13 December that [[Noah Musingku]], a [[Papua New Guinea]] businessman who once ran a failed [[pyramid scheme]] and has since been involved with an armed separatist movement on the island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], had contacted him several months earlier, offering [[Fijian dollar|F$35 million]] for his cooperation with respect to \"security work\" in Bougainville.

Senior Fijian military officers backed Bainimarama, who quickly called on the Government to resign.

Despite further talks in Suva and in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], Bainimarama gave the Prime Minister Qarase an ultimatum of 4 December to accede to his demands or to resign. In a televised address, Qarase agreed to put the three contentious bills on hold, review the appointment of Andrew Hughes as Police Commissioner (Bainimarama had demanded his dismissal), and give the police the option of discontinuing investigations into the Commander's alleged acts of sedition.  He refused further concessions, saying that he had conceded all that was possible within the law.\n\nMilitary manoeuvres followed, including the seizure of government vehicles and the house arrest of Prime Minister Qarase.  On 5 December President [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] was said to have signed a legal order dissolving Parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.  The President later issued a statement categorically denying having signed any such decree, however, and the exiled [[Law enforcement in Fiji|Commissioner of Police]], [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]], implicated Iloilo's secretary in the fabrication of the decree at the direction of Commander Bainimarama.\n\nAs of 9 December, there were reported arrests of members of the media and open dissenters,<ref name=\"fijitimes2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53181 |title=Fiji Times contributors warned by army \u2013 Fiji Times Online |publisher=Fijitimes.com |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222015828/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53181 |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  as well as incidents of intimidation and violence committed against political figures.<ref name=\"fijitimes2\"/> [[Stuart Huggett]], Chairman of the [[Public Service Commission (Fiji)|Public Service Commission]], was reported to have been assaulted.\n\nBainimarama told a press conference on 15 December that he would agree to attend a forthcoming meeting of the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], the feudal body empowered to choose the country's President, Vice-President, and fourteen of the thirty two [[Senate of Fiji|Senators]], only in his capacity as President of the Republic, the [[Fiji Sun]] reported.<ref>[http://www.sun.com.fj/pages/news.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214155333/http://www.sun.com.fj/pages/news.htm |date=14 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34447.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222181149/http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34447.shtml |date=22 December 2006 }}</ref>  Told that the Great Council still recognised Ratu Josefa Iloilo as President, he said that in that case he would boycott the meeting.  He also condemned the Great Council's invitation to deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, saying that Qarase would not be allowed to return to Suva to attend the meeting.\n\nOn 6 September 2007, Bainimarama imposed a renewed [[state of emergency]] for one month, alleging that Qarase and his spokesman were spreading lies and attempting to cause destabilisation, following Qarase's return to [[Suva]] after having been confined to the island of [[Vanua Balavu]] since his ouster.

Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country's [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] minority. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase's policies had \"divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations\". He added that \"the passing of the Reconciliation, Qoliqoli and Land Claims [Bills] will undermine the Constitution, will deprive many citizens of their rights as guaranteed under the Constitution and compromise and undermine the integrity of the Constitutional Offices including the Judiciary\". He explained that he would amend the race-based electoral rolls, so as to \"lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our multicultural nation\".<ref>[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml \"Commander RFMF \u2013 Public Declaration of Military Takeover\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915235544/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml |date=15 September 2009 }}, Fiji government, 5 December 2006</ref>\n\nAddressing the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in September 2007, he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[I]n 1970, Fiji started its journey as a young nation on a rather shaky foundation, with a race-based Constitution, one which rigidly compartmentalised our communities. The 'democracy' which came to be practised in Fiji was marked by divisive, adversarial, inward-looking, race-based politics. The legacy of leadership, at both community and national levels, was a fractured nation. Fiji's people were not allowed to share a common national identity.''\n<br /><br />\nOf the two major communities, indigenous Fijians were instilled with fear of dominance and dispossession by Indo-Fijians, and they desired protection of their status as the [[indigenous people]].

<small>Fijian:</small> [[Help:IPA/Fijian|[t\u0283o\u02c8s\u025bia \u03b2o\u02c8re\u014b\u0261e mb\u025bini\u02c8marama]]] is the 8th and current [[Prime Minister of Fiji|prime minister of Fiji]] since 2007. He is commonly known as '''Frank Bainimarama''' and sometimes by the chief title ''[[Ratu]].'' He was a naval officer and commander of the Fijian Military Forces.\n\nBainimarama attended [[Marist Brothers High School, Fiji|Marist Brothers High School]], [[Asian Institute of Technology]] and [[Dalhousie University]]. He joined the Fijian Navy in 1975 and rose through the ranks becoming an [[Able Seaman (rank)|Able Seaman]] and a [[Midshipman]] in 1976 ,an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in 1977 and later promoted to a [[sub-lieutenant]] at the end of that year. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander|lieutenant-commander]] in 1986 and became the [[commanding officer]] and a [[commander]] of the Fijian navy in 1988, he later became [[captain]] in 1991. In 1997, Bainimarama was appointed [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]]. In 1998, he was promoted to a [[Commodore]] becoming the Commander of the Armed Forces in 1999.\n\nBainimarama was the instigator of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|2006 coup]] who removed Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] from power, restoring [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] as president and himself as prime minister. He held this title until the 2014 election where his [[FijiFirst|Fiji First Party]] won and was sworn in as Prime Minister of Fiji by President [[Epeli Nailatikau|Ratu Epeli Nailatikau]]. In the [[2018 Fijian general election]] his [[FijiFirst]] Party won again an outright majority and Bainimarama was sworn-in as the Fijian Prime Minister for a second term on 20 November 2018.\n\n== Background ==\nBainimarama has taken power twice in Fiji's history, the first time as [[Head of State of Fiji|Head of the Interim Military Government]] of [[Fiji]] from 29 May to 13 July 2000, after organising a counter-coup to neutralise the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|ethnic Fijian putsch]] led by [[George Speight]]. He handed power over to the newly appointed [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Josefa Iloilo|Ratu Josefa Iloilo]]. He was instrumental in the rise to power of the government of the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], [[Laisenia Qarase]], but his intense criticism of the government's policy of showing leniency towards persons implicated in the coup later strained his relations with the regime, and on 5 December 2006, he overthrew the Qarase government and announced that he had \"reluctantly\" assumed the powers of the presidency. He restored [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] to the Presidency on 4 January 2007,<ref>AP (2006).

At the end of that year, he was promoted to [[Sub-Lieutenant]]. In January 1979, Bainimarama embarked on the [[Chile]]an naval training ship, the [[Buque Escuela Esmeralda|Buque Escuela ''Esmeralda'']], which spent six months circumnavigating [[South America]].  On his return to Fiji in August, Bainimarama was appointed Executive Officer of HMFS ''Kiro''.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}\n\nAfter a brief Navigation Course in [[HMAS Waterhen (naval base)|HMAS ''Watson'']] in March 1982, Bainimarama underwent Search and Rescue training at the [[United States Coast Guard]] Centre in [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}  On his return to Fiji, he was appointed commander of [[HMFS Kikau|HMFS ''Kikau'']], his first command post.  He went on to command [[HMFS Kula|HMFS ''Kula'']], and spent four months in 1984 in the markings of the Exclusive Economic Zones of [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], and [[Kiribati]].  After being promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]] in February 1986, he departed for [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] where he served for eighteen months with the [[Multinational Force and Observers]].{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}\n\nBainimarama returned to Fiji in September 1987.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}  He took charge of the delivery of two naval ships, the ''[[Levuka (ship)|Levuka]]'' and ''[[Lautoka (ship)|Lautoka]]'', from [[Louisiana]] in the [[United States]].

This was followed by Disaster Management training at the [[Asian Institute of Technology]] in 1993, and Exclusive Economic Zone Management training at [[Dalhousie University]], Canada, in 1994.  He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in October of that year, and went on to attend the [[Australian Defence College|Australian Joint Services Staff College]] (JSSC).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.gov.fj/about-us/minister-s-welcome-message/bio-data |title=Fiji Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=29 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926073520/http://www.foreignaffairs.gov.fj/about-us/minister-s-welcome-message/bio-data |archive-date=26 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  He attended the Integrated Logistics Support Overview course of the Australian Defence Co-operation Program on 23 September 1996, and the Chief of Army Conferences in [[Singapore]] in 1998 and 1999, as well as the Chief of Defence Conference in [[Hawaii]].\n\nBainimarama was appointed Acting Chief of Staff on 10 November 1997, and was confirmed in this post on 18 April 1998.

For 56 days Prime Minister [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and most of his cabinet, along with many parliamentarians and their staff, were held as hostages while Speight attempted to negotiate with the President, [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], who denounced the coup and declared a state of emergency.\n\nBelieving that President Kamisese Mara was not dealing effectively with the situation, Bainimarama apparently forced Mara to resign on 29 May 2000, in what some politicians have since called \"a coup within a coup,\" and formed an interim military government, which negotiated an accord under which the rebels would release all hostages, including the deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and would surrender without penalty.  The government later reneged on the last part of the agreement and arrested Speight on 27 July 2000, with Bainimarama saying that he had signed that part of the accord \"under duress.\"\n\n=== Post-2000 coup ===\nBainimarama attended a Leadership and Change Management course with the Public Service Training and Development program in February 2002, and a Policy Planning Analysis and Management course at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in [[Suva]] the following month.  He went on to attend the Defence and Strategic Studies Annual Conference at the [[Australian Defence College]] in [[Canberra]] on 2 August, and the Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]] from 18 to 30 August. In November that year, he was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]], but this promotion was reverted to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] on 1 February 2003.\n\nOn 4 September 2003, Bainimarama attended the [[Pacific Armies Management Seminar XXVII]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], and went on to attend the PKO Capacity Building Seminar in the [[Philippines|Philippine]] capital of [[Manila]].\n\nDespite his deteriorating relationship with the government, Bainimarama was reappointed Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces on 5 February 2004.  That month, he attended the Pacific Area Special Operations Conference.  This was followed by the Seminar Executive Course at the [[Asia Pacific Centre for Strategic Studies]] in [[Hawaii]] in April.  In May and June, he attended the [[South East Asia]] Security Symposium.  In September, he attended both the [[PAMS XXVII]] in the [[India]]n capital of [[New Delhi]], and the 7th Chief of Defence Conference in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].\n\nOn 14 December 2005, Bainimarama began an official visit to China, at the invitation of the [[People's Liberation Army]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Political controversies ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2011}}\n{{Main|2005\u201306 Fijian political crisis|2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\nBainimarama, who initially kept a high profile after the coup, later became embroiled in constant controversy.  He repeatedly entered the political arena to criticise government policy \u2013 especially its policy of leniency, as he saw it, towards persons responsible for the coup.  Politicians countered with charges of inappropriate interference in political affairs, and some accused him of hypocrisy, saying that he himself had a case to answer for his role in Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's resignation from the presidency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nBainimarama condemned the early release of persons imprisoned for their involvement in the 2000 coup, including former [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Jope Seniloli|Ratu Jope Seniloli]] and [[Naiqama Lalabalavu|Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu]], the [[Tui Cakau|Paramount Chief]] of the [[Tovata|Tovata Confederacy]].  He spoke out against the organising of [[Fiji Week, 2004|Fiji Week]], a week of religious services and cultural ceremonies, in which persons could apologise for their participation in the coup, that was held from 4 to 11 October 2004.  On 13 May 2005, he announced his implacable opposition to the government's proposal to establish a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]], with the power to grant compensation to victims of the 2000 coup, and amnesty to perpetrators of it.  He agreed with detractors who called it a sham to grant amnesty to supporters of the government who had played roles in the coup.  His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and June and into July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 11 July, Bainimarama issued one of his strongest-worded challenges yet to the government, saying that it was forcing the country into the same anarchy as in 2000. In an eight-page statement, he warned that the Military would take decisive action against any \"destabilisers\" \u2013 among whom he named Attorney-General Bale and Ministry of Reconciliation Chief Executive [[Apisalome Tudreu]].  ''\"The military will dish out the same fate we dealt George Speight and his group to anyone whom we think deserves this treatment,\"'' Bainimarama said.  He said that he would arrest and put on trial anyone who threatened the stability of Fiji.  The next day, it was revealed that a draft document signed by Bainimarama had originally contained a direct threat to overthrow the government if the bill went through.  ''\"The RFMF must stop the Bill from passing or get rid of the Government if it is passed. We can recover without this government, we cannot recover from this Bill,\"'' said part of an emboldened paragraph, which was edited out of the document, part of the Military's draft submission to the parliamentary committee considering the bill, before publication.  The document accused Prime Minister Qarase and Attorney-General Bale of playing the [[race card]] deliberately for political reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nHome Affairs Minister Vosanibola finally admitted on 13 July that the government was [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutionally]] powerless to do anything to discipline the Military commander.  He said that the government was very concerned about Bainimarama's behaviour, and accused the media of exacerbating the tensions.  ''\"You (the media) can play a major role and come to us first instead of coming to us after highlighting what he (Bainimarama) has said,\"'' Vosanibola told the Fiji Times.

Vosanibola had presented a letter of termination to the government, which they had discussed, he claimed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 24 August, Bainimarama went public with allegations that [[Senate of Fiji|Senator]] [[Apisai Tora]] and other politicians, whom he did not name, had asked him to depose President Iloilo in 2000.  Tora angrily denied the accusations, and was supported by Prime Minister Qarase, who claimed to have attended the meeting where the topic of removing President Iloilo was alleged to have come up.  No such topic was discussed, Qarase said.  Bainimarama reiterated his allegations on 1 September, and police spokeswoman [[Sylvia Low]] said that a file had, in fact, been opened as far back as 2001, when Bainimarama had made a statement to the police naming individuals he said were involved in the plot.  That file was still open, Low said.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 5 September, a team of Criminal Investigation Officers interviewed Bainimarama about his allegations.  The details of the discussion were not disclosed, except that Bainimarama had filed an official statement.  He told the media after the meeting that he was willing to testify in court.  Earlier, Kevueli Bulamainaivalu, the police officer heading the investigation, had said on 29 August that until Commodore Bainimarama had filed an official report and signed it, the police could do nothing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nBainimarama's detractors accused him of hypocrisy for vehemently opposing what he saw as the government's policy of leniency towards perpetrators of the 2000 coup, when there were unanswered questions about his own role in it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn 25 April 2004, then-[[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] [[Mick Beddoes]] called on the army to answer for its failure to protect President Mara while the country was in crisis.  He called this ''\"a fundamental failure\"'' on the part of the army.

Despite further talks in Suva and in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], Bainimarama gave the Prime Minister Qarase an ultimatum of 4 December to accede to his demands or to resign. In a televised address, Qarase agreed to put the three contentious bills on hold, review the appointment of Andrew Hughes as Police Commissioner (Bainimarama had demanded his dismissal), and give the police the option of discontinuing investigations into the Commander's alleged acts of sedition.  He refused further concessions, saying that he had conceded all that was possible within the law.\n\nMilitary manoeuvres followed, including the seizure of government vehicles and the house arrest of Prime Minister Qarase.  On 5 December President [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] was said to have signed a legal order dissolving Parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.  The President later issued a statement categorically denying having signed any such decree, however, and the exiled [[Law enforcement in Fiji|Commissioner of Police]], [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]], implicated Iloilo's secretary in the fabrication of the decree at the direction of Commander Bainimarama.\n\nAs of 9 December, there were reported arrests of members of the media and open dissenters,<ref name=\"fijitimes2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53181 |title=Fiji Times contributors warned by army \u2013 Fiji Times Online |publisher=Fijitimes.com |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222015828/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53181 |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  as well as incidents of intimidation and violence committed against political figures.<ref name=\"fijitimes2\"/> [[Stuart Huggett]], Chairman of the [[Public Service Commission (Fiji)|Public Service Commission]], was reported to have been assaulted.\n\nBainimarama told a press conference on 15 December that he would agree to attend a forthcoming meeting of the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], the feudal body empowered to choose the country's President, Vice-President, and fourteen of the thirty two [[Senate of Fiji|Senators]], only in his capacity as President of the Republic, the [[Fiji Sun]] reported.<ref>[http://www.sun.com.fj/pages/news.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214155333/http://www.sun.com.fj/pages/news.htm |date=14 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34447.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222181149/http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34447.shtml |date=22 December 2006 }}</ref>  Told that the Great Council still recognised Ratu Josefa Iloilo as President, he said that in that case he would boycott the meeting.

Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country's [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] minority. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase's policies had \"divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations\". He added that \"the passing of the Reconciliation, Qoliqoli and Land Claims [Bills] will undermine the Constitution, will deprive many citizens of their rights as guaranteed under the Constitution and compromise and undermine the integrity of the Constitutional Offices including the Judiciary\". He explained that he would amend the race-based electoral rolls, so as to \"lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our multicultural nation\".<ref>[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml \"Commander RFMF \u2013 Public Declaration of Military Takeover\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915235544/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml |date=15 September 2009 }}, Fiji government, 5 December 2006</ref>\n\nAddressing the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in September 2007, he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[I]n 1970, Fiji started its journey as a young nation on a rather shaky foundation, with a race-based Constitution, one which rigidly compartmentalised our communities. The 'democracy' which came to be practised in Fiji was marked by divisive, adversarial, inward-looking, race-based politics. The legacy of leadership, at both community and national levels, was a fractured nation. Fiji's people were not allowed to share a common national identity.''\n<br /><br />\nOf the two major communities, indigenous Fijians were instilled with fear of dominance and dispossession by Indo-Fijians, and they desired protection of their status as the [[indigenous people]]. Indo-Fijians, on the other hand, felt alienated and marginalised, as second-class citizens in their own country, the country of their birth, Fiji. [...]\n<br /><br />\nFiji's overall situation by 2006 had deteriorated sharply, heightened by massive corruption and lawlessness [...].\n<br /><br />\n[P]olicies which promote racial supremacy [...] must be removed once and for all.

The IRP was administrated by [[The International Center for Dispute Resolution|the International Center for Dispute Resolution (ICDR)]] of the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA) New York, US.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==== Dispute background ====\nDCA Trust had passed all the new gTLD applicant evaluation criteria, but before the Initial Evaluation (IE) result was issued, a Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) Objection Advice that had been issued in Beijing in April 2013 was later accepted by the ICANN Board in early June 2013 which caused the ICANN Board to instruct ICANN staff that DCA Trust's .Africa new gTLD application will not be approved. \n\nThis had caused the non-completion of the evaluation of DCA Trust's application; which then led DCA Trust to challenge the ICANN Board decision through a series of accountability mechanism.\n\nDCA Trust prevailed in the Independent Review Process against ICANN when the Panel of jurists ruled on 9 July 2015, that ICANN violated its Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation; and therefore declared \"that both the actions and inactions of the Board with respect to the application of DCA Trust relating to the .AFRICA gTLD were inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ICANN\".\n\nAs a result of the IRP declaration, the ICANN Board resolved on July 16, 2015, to reinstate DCA's application back to the new gTLD Process to complete initial evaluation. The IRP ruling also ordered ICANN to continue to refrain from delegating the .AFRICA gTLD to ZA Central Registry [[ZACR|(ZACR)]].\n\nOn January 20, 2016 ICANN was taken to the US Court regarding the way ICANN processed the IRP which declared DCA Trust the prevailing party in July 2015. The [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] in a ruling granted DCA Trust an Interim Relief for DotConnectAfrica and ordered ICANN to hold the delegation the .AFRICA top-level domain to ZACR. The same court also granted a Preliminary Injunction for DotConnectAfrica on April 12, 2016.\n\nICANN and ZACR both contested the ruling, the court dismissed ZACR from the case leading to the filing of an [[interlocutory appeal]] that will be heard on September 19, 2016.{{update inline|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe court had set the scheduling for the final jury trial for the .Africa case on February 28, 2017.{{update inline|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Court case results ====\n{{Needs update|date=April 2020|reason=}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://registry.africa/ Registry Africa]\n* [http://www.africainonespace.org Africa in One Space]\n* [http://dotconnectafrica.org/ DotConnectAfrica]\n* {{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AAA9&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=135FC40272764A08&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Continent Ready for New Internet Address Regime|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=March 14, 2011}}\n* {{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AAA9&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12E9EFAD4F11B250&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Announcing the Birth of the Dot.africaGeneration|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=March 22, 2010}}\n* http://africainonespace.org/news_item.php?id=667&title=Independent%20Review%20Process%20Delays%20dotAfrica%20(.africa)%20Public%20Launch\n* http://africainonespace.org/news_item.php?id=617&title=ICANN+AND+ZACR+SIGN+LANDMARK+DOTAFRICA+AGREEMENT\n* [http://icannwiki.com/DCA_Vs_ICANN_IRP DCA Vs ICANN IRP]\n\n{{Africa topics}}\n{{Africa topic |prefix=Internet in |state=expand}}\n{{GTLD|expanded=Proposed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Africa}}\n[[Category:Top-level domains]]\n[[Category:Internet in Africa]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2017]]\n[[Category:African Union]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2017]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead too short|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use South African English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Infobox Top level domain\n| name          = .africa\n| image         = [[File:Logo new-03-e1566127736523.png|Logo new-03-e1566127736523]]\n| introduced    = 2017<ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39231709 |title=Africa Gets Its Own Web Address with Launch of .africa |date=10 March 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n| type          = Generic [[top-level domain]]\n| status        = Active\n| registry      = [[Registry.Africa]]\n| intendeduse   = African and Pan African Constituency, [[African Union]]\n| actualuse     = General Availability 1 July 2017\n| restrictions  = None specified yet\n| structure     = Registrations at second level (ie. domain.africa)\n| document      = [https://www.icann.org/sites/default/files/tlds/africa/africa-agmt-html-23mar14-en.htm ICANN Registry Agreement]\n| disputepolicy = \n| website       = [https://registry.africa/ dotAfrica Registry]|\n| dnssec        = Yes\n}}\n\n'''.Africa'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registry.africa/|title=.africa Domain Name - One Continent.

Mason bees are named for their habit of using mud or other \"masonry\" products in constructing their nests, which are made in naturally occurring gaps such as between cracks in stones or other small dark cavities; when available some species preferentially use hollow stems or holes in wood made by wood-boring insects.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Bees of the World|last=Michener|first=Charles D.|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0801885730 |edition=2nd |pages=}}</ref>\n\nSpecies of the genus include the orchard mason bee ''[[Osmia lignaria]]'', the blueberry bee ''[[Osmia ribifloris|O. ribifloris]]'', and the hornfaced bee ''[[Osmia cornifrons|O. cornifrons]]''. The former two are native to the [[Americas]] and the latter to eastern Asia, although ''O. lignaria'' and ''O. cornifrons'' have been moved from their native ranges for commercial purposes. The red mason bee, ''[[Osmia bicornis]]'', is found across the European continent.

Mason bees are named for their habit of using mud or other \"masonry\" products in constructing their nests, which are made in naturally occurring gaps such as between cracks in stones or other small dark cavities; when available some species preferentially use hollow stems or holes in wood made by wood-boring insects.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Bees of the World|last=Michener|first=Charles D.|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0801885730 |edition=2nd |pages=}}</ref>\n\nSpecies of the genus include the orchard mason bee ''[[Osmia lignaria]]'', the blueberry bee ''[[Osmia ribifloris|O. ribifloris]]'', and the hornfaced bee ''[[Osmia cornifrons|O. cornifrons]]''. The former two are native to the [[Americas]] and the latter to eastern Asia, although ''O. lignaria'' and ''O. cornifrons'' have been moved from their native ranges for commercial purposes. The red mason bee, ''[[Osmia bicornis]]'', is found across the European continent.  Over 300 species are found across the Northern Hemisphere<!-- , and more than 130 species of mason bees in North America -->. Most occur in temperate habitats within the Palearctic and Neartic zones,  and are active from spring through late summer.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sedivy|first=C.D.|display-authors=etal|date=2013|title=Host range evolution in a selected group of osmiine bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae): the Boraginaceae-Fabaceae paradox.|url=|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=108|pages=35\u201354|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02013.x}}</ref>\n\n''Osmia'' species are frequently metallic green or blue, though many are blackish and at least one rust-red.

The males typically remain near the nests waiting for the females, and some are known to actively extract females from their cocoons.  When the females emerge, they mate with one or several males. The males soon die, and within a few days the females begin provisioning their nests.\n\n''Osmia'' females typically nest in narrow gaps and naturally occurring tubular cavities.<ref name=\":0\" /> Commonly this means hollow twigs, but can be in abandoned nests of wood-boring beetles or [[carpenter bee]]s, in [[snail]] shells, under bark, or in other small protected cavities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sedivy|first=C.|display-authors=etal|date=2012|title=Evolution of nesting behavior and kleptoparasitism in a selected group of osmiine bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae).|url=|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=108|issue=2|pages=349\u2013360|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02024.x}}</ref> They do not excavate their own nests.
