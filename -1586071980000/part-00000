One of the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Baltic German]] minority, Ungern was an arch-conservative [[monarchy|monarchist]] who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]] and to revive the [[Mongol Empire]] under the rule of the [[Bogd Khan]]. His attraction to [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the [[sobriquet]] \"the Mad Baron\" or \"the Bloody Baron\".\n\nIn February 1921, at the head of an \"Asiatic Cavalry Division\", Ungern expelled [[Occupation of Mongolia|Chinese troops from Mongolia]] and restored the monarchic power of the [[Bogd Khan]]. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Kh\u00fcree (now [[Ulaanbaatar]]), through fear, intimidation, and brutal violence against his opponents, particularly [[Bolshevik]] supporters. In June 1921 he went on to invade east [[Siberia]] in support of supposed anti-Bolshevik rebellions and to head off a [[Soviet intervention in Mongolia|Red Army-Mongolian partisan invasion]]; this action led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the [[Red Army]] and a month later put on trial for [[counter-revolutionary|counterrevolution]] in [[Novosibirsk|Novonikolaevsk]]. After a six-hour show trial he was found guilty, and on 15 September 1921 he was executed.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood and youth===\n[[Image:\u0423\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044a.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Nikolai Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg as a child.]]\n\nRobert Nikolaus Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg was born in [[Graz]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], in 1886 to a noble [[Baltic Germans|Baltic-German]] family. The Ungern-Sternberg family settled in what is now Estonia during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Ungern-Sternberg's first language was German, but he was also fluent in French, Russian, English and Estonian.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=18}} His mother was a German noblewoman named Sophie Charlotte von Wimpffen, later Sophie Charlotte von Ungern-Sternberg, and his father was Theodor Leonhard Rudolph Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (1857\u20131918). He also had [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] roots, and claimed descent from [[Batu Khan]], [[Genghis Khan]]'s grandson, which played a role in his dream of reviving the Mongol Empire.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Romein | authorlink=Jan Romein | title=The Asian Century: A History of Modern Nationalism in Asia | publisher=Allen & Unwin | year=1962 | translator=Clark, R. T. | page=128 | isbn=978-0049500082}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 his family moved to [[Tallinn|Reval]] (Tallinn), the capital of the [[Governorate of Estonia]] within the [[Russian Empire]], where his parents divorced in 1891. In 1894 his mother married Baltic German nobleman Oskar Anselm Hermann Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=22\u201323}} Ungern-Sternberg grew up in the Governorate, with his home being the Hoyningen-Huene estate at Jerwakant (modern [[J\u00e4rvakandi]], Estonia) that was set deep in the forests about 40 miles from Reval.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=17}} In the summer Ungern-Sternberg lived on the island of Dago (modern [[Hiiumaa]]) in the Baltic, which he liked to boast had belonged to his family for over 200 years.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=19}}\n\n[[File:BaronUngernSternbergWappen.jpg|thumb|alt=The coat of arms of the Baltic noble family von Ungern-Sternberg|The coat of arms of the Baltic noble family von Ungern-Sternberg]]\nAs a boy, Ungern-Sternberg was noted for being such a ferocious bully that even the other bullies feared him and several parents forbade their children from playing with him as he was a \"terror\".{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=19}} Ungern was well known for his love of torturing animals and at the age of 12 tried to strangle to death his cousin's pet owl for no particular good reason other than his cruelty towards animals.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=19}} Ungern-Sternberg had an extreme pride in his ancient, aristocratic family, later writing that his family had over the centuries \"never taken orders from the working classes\" and it was outrageous that \"dirty workers who've never had any servants of their own, but still think they can command\" should have any say in the ruling of the vast Russian Empire.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=24}} Ungern-Sternberg, despite his pride of German origin, identified himself very strongly with the Russian Empire. When asked if his \"family had distinguished itself in Russian service\", Ungern proudly answered: \"Seventy-two killed in wartime!\"{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=16}} Ungern-Sternberg believed that return to monarchies in Europe was possible with the aid of \"cavalry people\", meaning [[Russian Cossacks]], [[Buryats]], [[Tatars]], [[Mongols]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Kalmyks]], etc.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=392}}\n\nIn 1893, Ungern-Sternberg was surveying distant mountain ranges for the [[Tiflis Geographical Society]] in [[Tbilisi]].  In 1898 his father was briefly imprisoned for fraud and in 1899 was committed to the local insane asylum.{{sfn|Canfield|1980|p=591}} From 1900 to 1902 Ungern attended the [[Gustav Adolf Grammar School|Nicholas I Gymnasium]] in Reval. His school records show that he was an unruly, bad-tempered young man who was constantly in trouble with his teachers owing to frequent fights with other cadets and breaking other school rules\u2014smoking in bed, growing long hair, leaving without permission, etc.\u2014which finally led to the schoolmaster writing a letter in February 1905 to his stepfather and mother, asking them to withdraw him from the school, otherwise he would be expelled.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=20}} In 1905 he left the school to join the fighting in eastern Russia during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], but it is unclear whether he participated in operations against the Japanese or if all military operations had ceased before his arrival in [[Northeast China|Manchuria]],{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a|p=190}} although he was awarded the [[Russo-Japanese War Medal]] in 1913.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2013|p=178}}\n\nIn 1905 Russia exploded into revolution, and in the Governorate Estonian peasants went on a bloody ''[[jacquerie]]'' against the Baltic-German nobility, which owned most of the land there, lynching aristocrats and burning down their estates.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=24\u201325}} One of the estates burned down was the one at Jerwakant where Ungern-Sternberg had grown up. The revolution of 1905 and the destruction of the Jerwakant estate were huge traumas to Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the ''jacquerie'' as confirming his belief that the Estonian peasants who worked on his family's lands were all \"rough, untutored, wild and constantly angry, hating everybody and everything without understanding why\".{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=25}}\n\n[[File:Roman Ungern 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|left|R.F. Ungern in the form of the 91st Infantry Dvinsky Regiment]]\nIn 1906 Ungern was transferred to service in the Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg as a cadet of ordinary rank.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=27\u201330}} As an army cadet he proved to be a better student than he ever was as a naval cadet, and he actually studied his course material, though in the words of Palmer Ungern was a \"mediocre student\" at best.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=26}} During the same period Ungern-Sternberg had become obsessed with the occult and was especially interested in Buddhism. His cousin Count [[Hermann von Keyserling]], who knew him well later, wrote that the baron was very curious from his teenage years onward with \"[[Buddhist philosophy|Tibetan]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] philosophy\" and often spoke of the mystical powers possessed by \"geometrical symbols\". Keyserling called Ungern-Sternberg \"one of the most metaphysically and occultly gifted men I have ever met\" and believed that the baron was a clairvoyant who could read the minds of the people around him.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=28}} Later, in Mongolia, Ungern became a Buddhist but did not leave the Lutheran faith. There is a widespread view that he was viewed by Mongols as the incarnation of the \"God of War\" (the figure of [[Jamsaran]] in Tibetan and Mongol folklore). Although many Mongols may have believed him to be a deity, or at the very least a re-incarnation of Genghis Khan, Ungern was never officially proclaimed to be any of these incarnations.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAfter graduating he served as an officer in east [[Siberia]] in the 1st Argunsky and then in the 1st [[Amur Cossacks|Amursky Cossack]] regiments, where he became enthralled with the lifestyle of nomadic peoples such as the [[Mongols]] and [[Buryats]]. Ungern had specifically asked that he be stationed with a Cossack regiment in Asia, as he wanted to learn more about Asian culture, a request that was granted.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=32\u201333}} During this period Ungern-Sternberg was notorious for his heavy drinking and exceptionally cantankerous moods. In one such brawl his face was scarred when the officer he was fighting with struck him with his sword, leaving him with a distinctive facial scar.{{sfn|Canfield|1980|p=591}} It has been claimed that the sword blow that caused the scar also caused brain damage that was the root of Ungern's insanity.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=39\u201340}} However, a special study revealed that Ungern-Sternberg was not mentally insane, although the wound affected his irritability.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=368\u2013369}} Those who knew him well described him as very drawn towards \"Eastern culture\", as he was fascinated by Asian cultures, especially that of the Mongols and the Buryats.{{sfn|Sunderland|2014|p=57}} At the same time Ungern was an excellent horseman who earned the respect of the Mongols and the Buryats due to his skill at riding and fighting from a horse, being equally adept at using both a gun and his sword.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=37}} In 1913, at his request, he transferred to the reserves. Ungern moved to [[Outer Mongolia]] to assist Mongols in their struggle for independence from China, but Russian officials prevented him from fighting with Mongolian troops. He arrived in the town of [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] in western Mongolia and served as out-of-staff officer in the Cossack guard detachment at the Russian consulate.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=61\u201363}}\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Ungern-sternberg r.jpg|thumb|200px|Ungern-Sternberg]]\nOn 19 July 1914, Ungern joined front-line forces as part of the second-turn 34th Regiment of Cossack troops stationed on the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] frontier in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. He took part in the [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|Russian offensive]] in [[East Prussia]] and from 1915\u201316 also participated in rear-action raids on [[Imperial German Army|German troops]] by the L.N. Punin Cavalry Special Task Force.<ref>{{cite book | last=Khoroshilova | first=O | title=Voiskovye Partizany Velikoi Voiny | location=St. Petersburg | publisher=Evropeiskii Dom Publ.}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Ungern served in the Nerchinsky Regiment. Throughout the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] he gained a reputation as an extremely brave\u2014but somewhat reckless and mentally unstable\u2014officer, a man with no fear of death who seemed most happy leading cavalry charges or being in the thick of combat.{{sfn|Canfield|1980|p=592}} He was decorated with several military awards: [[Order of St. George|orders of St. George of the 4th grade]], [[Order of Saint Vladimir|St. Vladimir of the 4th grade]], [[Order of Saint Anna|St. Anna of the 3rd and 4th grades]], as well as [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov)|St. Stanislas of the 3rd grade]]. Despite his many awards, he was eventually discharged from one of his command positions for attacking another officer and a hall porter during a drunken rage in October 1916, which led to his being court-martialed and sentenced to two months in prison.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011| pp=67\u201370}} [[Pyotr Wrangel|Gen. Wrangel]] mentions Ungern's determination in his memoirs.\n\nAfter his release from prison in January 1917, Ungern was transferred to the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasian theatre]] of the conflict, where Russia was fighting against the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=75}} The [[February Revolution]] that ended the rule of the House of Romanov was an extremely bitter blow to the monarchist Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the revolution as the beginning of the end of Russia.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=79}} In the Caucasus Ungern-Sternberg first met Cossack Capt. [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]], later one of most well-known Russian anti-communist warlords in Siberia. In April 1917 near [[Urmia]], [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]], Ungern, together with Semyonov, started to organize a volunteer military unit composed of local [[Assyrian Christians]]. The Ottoman government had waged the [[Assyrian Genocide]], attempting to exterminate the Assyrian minority, which led to thousands of Assyrians fleeing to the Russian lines.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=77\u201378}} Ungern and Semyonov conceived of a scheme under which the two would organize and lead Assyrian troops to serve as an example for the Russian army, which was being demoralized by the revolutionary mood.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011| pp=67\u201370}} Under Ungern's command his Assyrians went on to score some minor victories over the [[Ottoman Army (1861\u20131922)|Turks]], but their total contribution to Russia's war effort was limited.<ref>Ataman Semenov. ''O sebe. Vospominaniya, Mysli i Vyvody''. Moscow: AST Publ., 2002<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> Afterwards, the Assyrian scheme led Semyonov to the idea of placing Buryat troops in Siberia. The Kerensky government gave its approval to Semyonov's plans, and Ungern-Sternberg soon headed east to join his friend in trying to raise a Buryat regiment.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=78\u201381}}\n\n===The Russian Civil War===\nAfter the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]]-led [[October Revolution]] of 1917, [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Semyonov]] and Ungern declared their allegiance to the Romanovs and vowed to fight the revolutionaries. In late 1917 Ungern, Semyonov and five Cossacks peacefully disarmed a group of about 1500 pro-Red combatants on a railway station in Manchuria on the China-Eastern Railway (FER) in China near the Russian border. For a time the station in Manchuria was a stronghold of Semyonov and Ungern in their preparations for war in [[Transbaikal]]. They started to enroll troops in a Special Manchurian Regiment, which became a nucleus for anti-communist forces led by Semyonov.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=76\u201378}}\n\nAfter the White troops defeated the Reds on a section of the FER line in Russia, Semyonov appointed Ungern commandant of troops stationed in [[Transbaikal|Dauria]], a railway station in a strategic position east-southeast of [[Lake Baikal]]. Semyonov and Ungern, though fervently anti-Bolshevik, were not typical of the figures to be found in the leadership of the [[White movement]], as their plans differed from those of the main White leaders. Semyonov refused to recognize the authority of Adm. [[Alexander Kolchak]], the nominal leader of the Whites in Siberia. Instead, he acted independently, supported by the Japanese with arms and money. For White leaders like Kolchak and [[Denikin]], who believed in a \"Russia strong and indivisible\", this represented high treason. Ungern was nominally subordinated to Semyonov but he, too, often acted independently.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=94\u201396}} Adm. Kolchak was a conservative but not a monarchist, who promised that after the victory of the Whites he would reconvene the Constituent Assembly disbanded by the Bolsheviks in January 1918, which would then decide the future of Russia, including the question of whether or not to restore the monarchy.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=87}} Ungern, to the contrary, believed that monarchs were accountable only to God, and the monarchy was the political system that God had chosen for Russia, so it was self-evident that it should be restored to the way it had existed before the [[October Manifesto]] of 1905. For Ungern, the opinions of the people of Russia were irrelevant, as monarchs were not accountable to the people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of his successful military operations in [[Hailar District|Hailar]] and Dauria, Ungern received the rank of Major-General. Semyonov entrusted him with forming military units to battle Bolshevik forces. They enrolled Buryats and Mongols in their national military units. In Dauria, Ungern formed the volunteer Asiatic Cavalry Division (Russian: \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u044f), which included [[Russians]], [[Buryats]], [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Mongols]] from different tribes, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Poles|Polish]] exiles and many others.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=94\u201396}} Ungern reinforced his military station at Dauria, creating a kind of fortress from which his troops launched attacks on Red forces. Under his rule, Dauria became a well-known \"torture center\" filled with the bones of dozens of Ungern's victims, people who were executed because of accusations of being Reds or thieves (details in {{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=102\u2013103}}). Ungern's chief executioner had been a Col. Laurentz, but later, in Mongolia, Ungern had him executed because he lost Ungern's trust, although under unclear circumstances.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=370}} Like many other White units, Ungern's troops employed \"requisitions\" as a source of their supply. They examined trains passing through Dauria to Manchuria.

[[Xu Shuzheng]] to join [[Outer Mongolia]] to China and end its autonomy. This violated the terms of a tripartite Russian-Mongolian-Chinese agreement concluded in 1915, which secured the autonomy of Outer Mongolia and did not allow the presence of Chinese troops, except for small numbers of consular guards.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=141\u2013143}} Although the Anhui party was supported by Japan, indications that Japan inspired Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia<ref>{{cite book | title=The land and people of Mongolia | first=John S. | last=Major | year=1990 | page=[https://archive.org/details/landpeopleofmong00majo/page/119 119] | publisher=Harper and Row | isbn=978-0-397-32386-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/landpeopleofmong00majo/page/119 }}</ref> have not yet been confirmed by documents.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=120\u201355}} After the fall of Anhui party rule in China, Chinese soldiers in Mongolia found themselves effectively abandoned.

There he established contacts with monarchist circles and also made preparations for Semyonov to meet with Manchurian warlord Marshal [[Zhang Zuolin]], the \"Old Marshal\". In July 1919 Ungern married Manchurian princess Ji in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] ceremony in [[Harbin]]. The princess was given the name Elena Pavlovna. She and Ungern communicated in [[English language|English]], their only common language.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=110}} This marriage had a political aim, as Ji was a princess and a relative of Gen.

Ungern, however, saw this as an opportunity to implement his monarchistic plan. On 7 August 1920 he broke his allegiance to Semyonov and transformed his Asiatic Cavalry Division into a guerrilla detachment.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Ungern's troops started to move towards the border of Outer Mongolia. They crossed the northern border of Outer Mongolia on 1 October 1920 and moved southwest.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Having crossed the Mongolian border, Ungern moved westwards to the Mongolian capital of Urga (officially [[Niislel Khuree]], now [[Ulaanbaatar]]). He entered into negotiations with Chinese occupying forces. All of his demands, including disarmament of the Chinese troops, were rejected. On 26\u201327 October and again on 2\u20134 November 1920, Ungern's troops assaulted Urga, but suffered disastrous losses. After the defeat his forces retreated to the upper currents of the [[Kherlen River]], in Setsen-Khan Aimag (district ruled by princes with the title Setsen Khan), in eastern Outer Mongolia. He was supported by Mongols who sought independence from Chinese occupation, especially the spiritual and secular leader of Mongols, the [[Bogd Khan]], who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling Chinese from Mongolia. The Chinese had tightened their control of Outer Mongolia by this time, strictly regulating Buddhist services in monasteries and imprisoning Russians and Mongols whom they considered \"separatists\". According to memoirs by M. G. Tornovsky, the Asiatic Division numbered 1,460 men, while the Chinese garrison was 7000 strong. The Chinese had the advantage in artillery and machine guns and had built a network of trenches in and around Urga.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} At his camp Ungern imposed ferocious discipline on his Russian soldiers to prevent desertion and demoralization.\n\n[[File:Mongolor_Building_Ulaanbaatar.jpg|thumb|The [[Mongolor Building]] of Urga where the Chinese made their last stand and which Ungern made his headquarters]]\nUngern's troops began moving from their camp to Urga on 31 January. On 2 February they battled for control of Chinese front lines and secured parts of Urga.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} His detachment, led by B. P. Rezukhin, captured Chinese front-line fortifications near Small Madachan and Big Madachan settlements in the southeastern vicinities of Urga. During the battle Ungern's special detachment of [[Tibetans]], [[Mongols]], [[Buryats]] and [[Russians]] rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=176\u2013178, 339\u2013341}} On 3 February he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from [[Genghis Khan]], he ordered his troops to light a large number of campfires in the hills surrounding Urga, using them as reference points for Rezukhin's detachment. This made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force.{{sfn|Pershin|1999}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Early on 4 February Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east and captured them. Then he divided his forces in two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement ({{zh|\u8cb7\u8ce3\u57ce}}, ''Maimaicheng''). The second moved westwards towards the part of Urga called Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by blasting the gates with explosives and improvised battering rams.<ref>Palmer, James ''The Bloody White Baron: The Extraordinary Story of the Russian Nobleman Who Became the Last Khan of Mongolia'', New York: Basic Books, 2009, p. 154.</ref> After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabers. After the capture of Maimacheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern's soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern's troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers.  The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga on 11 cars on the night of 3\u20134 February. Chinese troops fled northward on 4 and 5 February. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga the Chinese lost about 1500 men, while Ungern's forces suffered about 60 casualties.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=179}}\n\nAfter the battle, Ungern's troops began plundering Chinese stores and killing Russian Jews who were living in Urga, as the Cossacks had also been set against the Jews. Ungern himself ordered the Jews to be killed, except for those who had notes from him sparing their lives. It has been estimated by surviving archival documents and memoirs that 43\u201350 Jews were killed during Ungern's stay in Mongolia, or about 5%\u20136% of all those executed under his orders. Several days later the looting by his troops was stopped by Ungern, but his secret-police bureau led by Col. Leonid Sipailo continued searching for \"Reds\".{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=417}} Between 11 and 13 March Ungern captured a fortified Chinese base at [[Choir, Mongolia|Choir]] between the mountains Otsol Uul and Choiryn Bogd Uul to the south of Urga. Ungern had 900 troops and the Chinese defenders about 1500. After capturing Choir Ungern himself returned to Urga. His detachments, consisting of Cossacks and Mongols, moved southward to [[Zamyn-\u00dc\u00fcd]], a frontier settlement and another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-\u00dc\u00fcd without a fight.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=187}}\n\nWhen the remaining Chinese troops, having retreated to northern Mongolia near [[Kyakhta]], attempted to round Urga to the west in order to reach China, the Russians and Mongols feared they were attempting to re-capture Urga. Several hundred Cossack and Mongol troops were dispatched to stop the Chinese forces, which numbered several thousand, in the area of Talyn Ulaankhad Hill near the Urga\u2013Uliastai road in central Mongolia. After a battle that raged from 30 March to 2 April, in which more than 1000 Chinese and approximately 100 Mongols, Russians and Buryats were killed, the Chinese were routed and chased to the southern border of the country. Thus Chinese forces left Outer Mongolia.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [https://www.academia.edu/9071366/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%A1.%D0%9B._%D0%9E%D1%8E%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%8D%D0%B3_%D0%96._%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%80_%D0%91._2011-2012._%D0%A3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8B%D0%BD_%D0%B4%D1%8D%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%8D%D0%B4%D1%8D%D1%85_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BD_%D1%82%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B0%D1%80_%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BD_%D1%82%D3%A9%D0%BB%D3%A9%D3%A9_%D1%82%D1%8D%D0%BC%D1%86%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB_%D2%AF%D0%B9%D0%BB_%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BD_%D0%BD%D1%8D%D0%B3_%D0%BC%D3%A9%D0%BD_Kuzmin_S.L._Oyuunchimeg_J._Bayar_B._2011-2012._The_battle_at_Ulaankhad_one_of_the_main_events_in_the_fight_for_independence_of_Mongolia_ Kuzmin, S.

Studies of interrogations of these people from Japanese archive revealed that they were mercenaries serving on their own, as other nationals in the division, and that Ungern was not managed by Japan.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [https://www.academia.edu/7730236/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%A1.%D0%9B._%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%9E._%D0%9D%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D0%9A._%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%9C._2009._%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%A3%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD_%D0%B8_%D0%AF%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_Kuzmin_S.L._Batsaikhan_O._Nunami_K._and_Tachibana_M._2009._Baron_Ungern_and_Japan_ Kuzmin S.L., Batsaikhan, O., Nunami, K. and Tachibana, M. 2009.

In 1921 various [[Red Army]] units belonging to [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and to the [[Far Eastern Republic]] invaded newly independent Mongolia to defeat Ungern. These forces included Red Mongolian leader [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]]. Spies and various smaller diversionary units went ahead to spread terror to weaken Ungern's forces. Ungern organized an expedition to meet these forces in Siberia and to support ongoing anti-Bolshevik rebellions. Believing he had the unwavering popular support of locals in Siberia and Mongolia, Ungern failed to properly strengthen his troops despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Red forces. However, unbeknownst to Ungern, the Reds had successfully crushed uprisings in Siberia and Soviet economic policies had temporarily softened in Lenin's [[New Economic Policy|NEP]]. Upon Ungern's arrival in Siberia, few local peasants and Cossacks volunteered to join him.\n\nIn the spring the Asiatic Cavalry Division was divided into two brigades: one under the command of Lt. Gen. Ungern and the second under Maj. Gen. Rezukhin. In May Rezukhin's brigade launched a raid beyond the Russian border to the west of the [[Selenga River]]. Ungern's brigade left Urga and slowly moved to the Russian town of Troitskosavsk (present-day [[Kyakhta]] in [[Buryatia]]). Meanwhile, the Reds moved large numbers of troops towards Mongolia from different directions. They had a tremendous advantage in equipment (armored cars, airplanes, rail, gunboats, ammunition, human reserves, etc.) and in number of troops. As a result, Ungern was defeated in battles that took place between 11 and 13 June and he failed to capture Troitskosavsk. Combined Bolshevik and Red Mongol forces [[Soviet occupation of Mongolia|entered Urga]] on 6 July 1921, after a few small skirmishes with Ungern's guard detachments.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[File:Ungern Von Sternberg before execution.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ungern-Sternberg before execution]]\nAlthough they had captured Urga, the Red forces failed to defeat the main forces of the Asiatic Division (Ungern's and Rezukhin's brigades). Ungern regrouped and attempted to invade Transbaikal across the Russo-Mongolian border. To rally his soldiers and local people, he quoted an agreement with Grigory Semyonov and pointed to a supposed Japanese offensive that was to support their drive, although neither Semyonov nor the Japanese were eager to assist him. After several days rest, on 18 July the Asiatic Division started its raid into Soviet territory. Eyewitnesses Kamil Gi\u017cycki and Mikhail Tornovsky gave similar estimates of their numbers: about 3000 men in total.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2004b}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Ungern's troops penetrated deep into Russian territory. The Soviets declared martial law in areas where the Whites were expected, including Verkhneudinsk (now [[Ulan-Ude]], the capital of Buryatia). Ungern's troops captured many settlements, the northernmost being [[Novoselenginsk]], which they occupied on 1 August. By this time Ungern understood that his offensive was ill-prepared; he also heard about the approach of large Red forces. On 2 August 1921 he began his retreat to Mongolia, where he declared his determination to fight [[Communism]]. While Ungern's troops wanted to abandon the war effort and head towards Manchuria to join with other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, it soon became clear that Ungern had other ideas. He wanted to retreat to [[Tuva]], then to Tibet. Troops under both Ungern and Rezukhin effectively mutinied and hatched plots to kill their respective commanders. On 17 August Rezukhin was murdered. A day later conspirators unsuccessfully tried to assassinate Ungern. His command then collapsed as his brigade broke apart. On 20 August Ungern was captured by a Soviet detachment led by guerrilla commander [[Petr Efimovich Shchetinkin|P. E. Shchetinkin]] (later a member of the [[Cheka]]).{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=228\u2013372}} After a [[show trial]] of six hours and 15 minutes on 15 September 1921, prosecuted by [[Yemelyan Yaroslavsky]], the Baron was sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]].

One of the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Baltic German]] minority, Ungern was an arch-conservative [[monarchy|monarchist]] who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]] and to revive the [[Mongol Empire]] under the rule of the [[Bogd Khan]]. His attraction to [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the [[sobriquet]] \"the Mad Baron\" or \"the Bloody Baron\".\n\nIn February 1921, at the head of an \"Asiatic Cavalry Division\", Ungern expelled [[Occupation of Mongolia|Chinese troops from Mongolia]] and restored the monarchic power of the [[Bogd Khan]]. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Kh\u00fcree (now [[Ulaanbaatar]]), through fear, intimidation, and brutal violence against his opponents, particularly [[Bolshevik]] supporters. In June 1921 he went on to invade east [[Siberia]] in support of supposed anti-Bolshevik rebellions and to head off a [[Soviet intervention in Mongolia|Red Army-Mongolian partisan invasion]]; this action led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the [[Red Army]] and a month later put on trial for [[counter-revolutionary|counterrevolution]] in [[Novosibirsk|Novonikolaevsk]]. After a six-hour show trial he was found guilty, and on 15 September 1921 he was executed.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood and youth===\n[[Image:\u0423\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044a.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Nikolai Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg as a child.]]\n\nRobert Nikolaus Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg was born in [[Graz]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], in 1886 to a noble [[Baltic Germans|Baltic-German]] family.

His school records show that he was an unruly, bad-tempered young man who was constantly in trouble with his teachers owing to frequent fights with other cadets and breaking other school rules\u2014smoking in bed, growing long hair, leaving without permission, etc.\u2014which finally led to the schoolmaster writing a letter in February 1905 to his stepfather and mother, asking them to withdraw him from the school, otherwise he would be expelled.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=20}} In 1905 he left the school to join the fighting in eastern Russia during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], but it is unclear whether he participated in operations against the Japanese or if all military operations had ceased before his arrival in [[Northeast China|Manchuria]],{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a|p=190}} although he was awarded the [[Russo-Japanese War Medal]] in 1913.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2013|p=178}}\n\nIn 1905 Russia exploded into revolution, and in the Governorate Estonian peasants went on a bloody ''[[jacquerie]]'' against the Baltic-German nobility, which owned most of the land there, lynching aristocrats and burning down their estates.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=24\u201325}} One of the estates burned down was the one at Jerwakant where Ungern-Sternberg had grown up. The revolution of 1905 and the destruction of the Jerwakant estate were huge traumas to Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the ''jacquerie'' as confirming his belief that the Estonian peasants who worked on his family's lands were all \"rough, untutored, wild and constantly angry, hating everybody and everything without understanding why\".{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=25}}\n\n[[File:Roman Ungern 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|left|R.F. Ungern in the form of the 91st Infantry Dvinsky Regiment]]\nIn 1906 Ungern was transferred to service in the Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg as a cadet of ordinary rank.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=27\u201330}} As an army cadet he proved to be a better student than he ever was as a naval cadet, and he actually studied his course material, though in the words of Palmer Ungern was a \"mediocre student\" at best.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=26}} During the same period Ungern-Sternberg had become obsessed with the occult and was especially interested in Buddhism. His cousin Count [[Hermann von Keyserling]], who knew him well later, wrote that the baron was very curious from his teenage years onward with \"[[Buddhist philosophy|Tibetan]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] philosophy\" and often spoke of the mystical powers possessed by \"geometrical symbols\". Keyserling called Ungern-Sternberg \"one of the most metaphysically and occultly gifted men I have ever met\" and believed that the baron was a clairvoyant who could read the minds of the people around him.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=28}} Later, in Mongolia, Ungern became a Buddhist but did not leave the Lutheran faith. There is a widespread view that he was viewed by Mongols as the incarnation of the \"God of War\" (the figure of [[Jamsaran]] in Tibetan and Mongol folklore). Although many Mongols may have believed him to be a deity, or at the very least a re-incarnation of Genghis Khan, Ungern was never officially proclaimed to be any of these incarnations.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAfter graduating he served as an officer in east [[Siberia]] in the 1st Argunsky and then in the 1st [[Amur Cossacks|Amursky Cossack]] regiments, where he became enthralled with the lifestyle of nomadic peoples such as the [[Mongols]] and [[Buryats]]. Ungern had specifically asked that he be stationed with a Cossack regiment in Asia, as he wanted to learn more about Asian culture, a request that was granted.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=32\u201333}} During this period Ungern-Sternberg was notorious for his heavy drinking and exceptionally cantankerous moods. In one such brawl his face was scarred when the officer he was fighting with struck him with his sword, leaving him with a distinctive facial scar.{{sfn|Canfield|1980|p=591}} It has been claimed that the sword blow that caused the scar also caused brain damage that was the root of Ungern's insanity.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=39\u201340}} However, a special study revealed that Ungern-Sternberg was not mentally insane, although the wound affected his irritability.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=368\u2013369}} Those who knew him well described him as very drawn towards \"Eastern culture\", as he was fascinated by Asian cultures, especially that of the Mongols and the Buryats.{{sfn|Sunderland|2014|p=57}} At the same time Ungern was an excellent horseman who earned the respect of the Mongols and the Buryats due to his skill at riding and fighting from a horse, being equally adept at using both a gun and his sword.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=37}} In 1913, at his request, he transferred to the reserves. Ungern moved to [[Outer Mongolia]] to assist Mongols in their struggle for independence from China, but Russian officials prevented him from fighting with Mongolian troops. He arrived in the town of [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] in western Mongolia and served as out-of-staff officer in the Cossack guard detachment at the Russian consulate.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=61\u201363}}\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Ungern-sternberg r.jpg|thumb|200px|Ungern-Sternberg]]\nOn 19 July 1914, Ungern joined front-line forces as part of the second-turn 34th Regiment of Cossack troops stationed on the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] frontier in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. He took part in the [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|Russian offensive]] in [[East Prussia]] and from 1915\u201316 also participated in rear-action raids on [[Imperial German Army|German troops]] by the L.N.

Throughout the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] he gained a reputation as an extremely brave\u2014but somewhat reckless and mentally unstable\u2014officer, a man with no fear of death who seemed most happy leading cavalry charges or being in the thick of combat.{{sfn|Canfield|1980|p=592}} He was decorated with several military awards: [[Order of St. George|orders of St. George of the 4th grade]], [[Order of Saint Vladimir|St. Vladimir of the 4th grade]], [[Order of Saint Anna|St. Anna of the 3rd and 4th grades]], as well as [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov)|St. Stanislas of the 3rd grade]]. Despite his many awards, he was eventually discharged from one of his command positions for attacking another officer and a hall porter during a drunken rage in October 1916, which led to his being court-martialed and sentenced to two months in prison.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011| pp=67\u201370}} [[Pyotr Wrangel|Gen. Wrangel]] mentions Ungern's determination in his memoirs.\n\nAfter his release from prison in January 1917, Ungern was transferred to the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasian theatre]] of the conflict, where Russia was fighting against the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=75}} The [[February Revolution]] that ended the rule of the House of Romanov was an extremely bitter blow to the monarchist Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the revolution as the beginning of the end of Russia.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=79}} In the Caucasus Ungern-Sternberg first met Cossack Capt. [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]], later one of most well-known Russian anti-communist warlords in Siberia. In April 1917 near [[Urmia]], [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]], Ungern, together with Semyonov, started to organize a volunteer military unit composed of local [[Assyrian Christians]]. The Ottoman government had waged the [[Assyrian Genocide]], attempting to exterminate the Assyrian minority, which led to thousands of Assyrians fleeing to the Russian lines.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=77\u201378}} Ungern and Semyonov conceived of a scheme under which the two would organize and lead Assyrian troops to serve as an example for the Russian army, which was being demoralized by the revolutionary mood.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011| pp=67\u201370}} Under Ungern's command his Assyrians went on to score some minor victories over the [[Ottoman Army (1861\u20131922)|Turks]], but their total contribution to Russia's war effort was limited.<ref>Ataman Semenov. ''O sebe. Vospominaniya, Mysli i Vyvody''. Moscow: AST Publ., 2002<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> Afterwards, the Assyrian scheme led Semyonov to the idea of placing Buryat troops in Siberia. The Kerensky government gave its approval to Semyonov's plans, and Ungern-Sternberg soon headed east to join his friend in trying to raise a Buryat regiment.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|pp=78\u201381}}\n\n===The Russian Civil War===\nAfter the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]]-led [[October Revolution]] of 1917, [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Semyonov]] and Ungern declared their allegiance to the Romanovs and vowed to fight the revolutionaries. In late 1917 Ungern, Semyonov and five Cossacks peacefully disarmed a group of about 1500 pro-Red combatants on a railway station in Manchuria on the China-Eastern Railway (FER) in China near the Russian border. For a time the station in Manchuria was a stronghold of Semyonov and Ungern in their preparations for war in [[Transbaikal]]. They started to enroll troops in a Special Manchurian Regiment, which became a nucleus for anti-communist forces led by Semyonov.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=76\u201378}}\n\nAfter the White troops defeated the Reds on a section of the FER line in Russia, Semyonov appointed Ungern commandant of troops stationed in [[Transbaikal|Dauria]], a railway station in a strategic position east-southeast of [[Lake Baikal]]. Semyonov and Ungern, though fervently anti-Bolshevik, were not typical of the figures to be found in the leadership of the [[White movement]], as their plans differed from those of the main White leaders. Semyonov refused to recognize the authority of Adm. [[Alexander Kolchak]], the nominal leader of the Whites in Siberia. Instead, he acted independently, supported by the Japanese with arms and money. For White leaders like Kolchak and [[Denikin]], who believed in a \"Russia strong and indivisible\", this represented high treason. Ungern was nominally subordinated to Semyonov but he, too, often acted independently.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=94\u201396}} Adm. Kolchak was a conservative but not a monarchist, who promised that after the victory of the Whites he would reconvene the Constituent Assembly disbanded by the Bolsheviks in January 1918, which would then decide the future of Russia, including the question of whether or not to restore the monarchy.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=87}} Ungern, to the contrary, believed that monarchs were accountable only to God, and the monarchy was the political system that God had chosen for Russia, so it was self-evident that it should be restored to the way it had existed before the [[October Manifesto]] of 1905. For Ungern, the opinions of the people of Russia were irrelevant, as monarchs were not accountable to the people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of his successful military operations in [[Hailar District|Hailar]] and Dauria, Ungern received the rank of Major-General. Semyonov entrusted him with forming military units to battle Bolshevik forces. They enrolled Buryats and Mongols in their national military units. In Dauria, Ungern formed the volunteer Asiatic Cavalry Division (Russian: \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u044f), which included [[Russians]], [[Buryats]], [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Mongols]] from different tribes, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Poles|Polish]] exiles and many others.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=94\u201396}} Ungern reinforced his military station at Dauria, creating a kind of fortress from which his troops launched attacks on Red forces. Under his rule, Dauria became a well-known \"torture center\" filled with the bones of dozens of Ungern's victims, people who were executed because of accusations of being Reds or thieves (details in {{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=102\u2013103}}). Ungern's chief executioner had been a Col. Laurentz, but later, in Mongolia, Ungern had him executed because he lost Ungern's trust, although under unclear circumstances.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=370}} Like many other White units, Ungern's troops employed \"requisitions\" as a source of their supply. They examined trains passing through Dauria to Manchuria. While these confiscations did not significantly diminish the supplies of Kolchak's forces, private Russian and Chinese merchants lost considerable property.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nIn 1919, taking advantage of the weakness of Russia's government caused by revolutions and civil war, the Chinese government, established by members of the [[Anhui Clique|Anhui military party]], sent troops led by Gen. [[Xu Shuzheng]] to join [[Outer Mongolia]] to China and end its autonomy. This violated the terms of a tripartite Russian-Mongolian-Chinese agreement concluded in 1915, which secured the autonomy of Outer Mongolia and did not allow the presence of Chinese troops, except for small numbers of consular guards.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=141\u2013143}} Although the Anhui party was supported by Japan, indications that Japan inspired Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia<ref>{{cite book | title=The land and people of Mongolia | first=John S. | last=Major | year=1990 | page=[https://archive.org/details/landpeopleofmong00majo/page/119 119] | publisher=Harper and Row | isbn=978-0-397-32386-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/landpeopleofmong00majo/page/119 }}</ref> have not yet been confirmed by documents.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=120\u201355}} After the fall of Anhui party rule in China, Chinese soldiers in Mongolia found themselves effectively abandoned.

There he established contacts with monarchist circles and also made preparations for Semyonov to meet with Manchurian warlord Marshal [[Zhang Zuolin]], the \"Old Marshal\". In July 1919 Ungern married Manchurian princess Ji in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] ceremony in [[Harbin]]. The princess was given the name Elena Pavlovna. She and Ungern communicated in [[English language|English]], their only common language.{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=110}} This marriage had a political aim, as Ji was a princess and a relative of Gen. Zhang Kuiwu, commander of Chinese troops at the western end of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|Chinese-Manchurian Railway]], and governor of [[Hailar District|Hailar]].{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=94\u201396}}\n\n===Restoring the independence of Outer Mongolia===\n[[File:Ungern-Sternberg-1920.jpg|thumb|200px|Ungern-Sternberg in a Mongolian [[Deel (clothing)|deel]] uniform with Russian Order of St. George 4th Class]]\nAfter [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]]'s defeat at the hands of the [[Red Army]] and the subsequent decision of [[Japan]] to withdraw its expeditionary troops from the [[Transbaikal]], Semyonov, unable to withstand the pressure of Bolshevik forces, planned a retreat to [[Northeast China|Manchuria]]. Ungern, however, saw this as an opportunity to implement his monarchistic plan. On 7 August 1920 he broke his allegiance to Semyonov and transformed his Asiatic Cavalry Division into a guerrilla detachment.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Ungern's troops started to move towards the border of Outer Mongolia. They crossed the northern border of Outer Mongolia on 1 October 1920 and moved southwest.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Having crossed the Mongolian border, Ungern moved westwards to the Mongolian capital of Urga (officially [[Niislel Khuree]], now [[Ulaanbaatar]]). He entered into negotiations with Chinese occupying forces. All of his demands, including disarmament of the Chinese troops, were rejected. On 26\u201327 October and again on 2\u20134 November 1920, Ungern's troops assaulted Urga, but suffered disastrous losses. After the defeat his forces retreated to the upper currents of the [[Kherlen River]], in Setsen-Khan Aimag (district ruled by princes with the title Setsen Khan), in eastern Outer Mongolia. He was supported by Mongols who sought independence from Chinese occupation, especially the spiritual and secular leader of Mongols, the [[Bogd Khan]], who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling Chinese from Mongolia. The Chinese had tightened their control of Outer Mongolia by this time, strictly regulating Buddhist services in monasteries and imprisoning Russians and Mongols whom they considered \"separatists\". According to memoirs by M. G. Tornovsky, the Asiatic Division numbered 1,460 men, while the Chinese garrison was 7000 strong. The Chinese had the advantage in artillery and machine guns and had built a network of trenches in and around Urga.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} At his camp Ungern imposed ferocious discipline on his Russian soldiers to prevent desertion and demoralization.\n\n[[File:Mongolor_Building_Ulaanbaatar.jpg|thumb|The [[Mongolor Building]] of Urga where the Chinese made their last stand and which Ungern made his headquarters]]\nUngern's troops began moving from their camp to Urga on 31 January. On 2 February they battled for control of Chinese front lines and secured parts of Urga.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} His detachment, led by B. P. Rezukhin, captured Chinese front-line fortifications near Small Madachan and Big Madachan settlements in the southeastern vicinities of Urga. During the battle Ungern's special detachment of [[Tibetans]], [[Mongols]], [[Buryats]] and [[Russians]] rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=176\u2013178, 339\u2013341}} On 3 February he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from [[Genghis Khan]], he ordered his troops to light a large number of campfires in the hills surrounding Urga, using them as reference points for Rezukhin's detachment. This made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force.{{sfn|Pershin|1999}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Early on 4 February Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east and captured them. Then he divided his forces in two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement ({{zh|\u8cb7\u8ce3\u57ce}}, ''Maimaicheng''). The second moved westwards towards the part of Urga called Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by blasting the gates with explosives and improvised battering rams.<ref>Palmer, James ''The Bloody White Baron: The Extraordinary Story of the Russian Nobleman Who Became the Last Khan of Mongolia'', New York: Basic Books, 2009, p. 154.</ref> After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabers. After the capture of Maimacheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern's soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern's troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers.  The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga on 11 cars on the night of 3\u20134 February. Chinese troops fled northward on 4 and 5 February. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga the Chinese lost about 1500 men, while Ungern's forces suffered about 60 casualties.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=179}}\n\nAfter the battle, Ungern's troops began plundering Chinese stores and killing Russian Jews who were living in Urga, as the Cossacks had also been set against the Jews. Ungern himself ordered the Jews to be killed, except for those who had notes from him sparing their lives. It has been estimated by surviving archival documents and memoirs that 43\u201350 Jews were killed during Ungern's stay in Mongolia, or about 5%\u20136% of all those executed under his orders. Several days later the looting by his troops was stopped by Ungern, but his secret-police bureau led by Col. Leonid Sipailo continued searching for \"Reds\".{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=417}} Between 11 and 13 March Ungern captured a fortified Chinese base at [[Choir, Mongolia|Choir]] between the mountains Otsol Uul and Choiryn Bogd Uul to the south of Urga. Ungern had 900 troops and the Chinese defenders about 1500. After capturing Choir Ungern himself returned to Urga. His detachments, consisting of Cossacks and Mongols, moved southward to [[Zamyn-\u00dc\u00fcd]], a frontier settlement and another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-\u00dc\u00fcd without a fight.{{sfn|Tornovsky|2004a}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|p=187}}\n\nWhen the remaining Chinese troops, having retreated to northern Mongolia near [[Kyakhta]], attempted to round Urga to the west in order to reach China, the Russians and Mongols feared they were attempting to re-capture Urga. Several hundred Cossack and Mongol troops were dispatched to stop the Chinese forces, which numbered several thousand, in the area of Talyn Ulaankhad Hill near the Urga\u2013Uliastai road in central Mongolia. After a battle that raged from 30 March to 2 April, in which more than 1000 Chinese and approximately 100 Mongols, Russians and Buryats were killed, the Chinese were routed and chased to the southern border of the country.

In 1921 various [[Red Army]] units belonging to [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and to the [[Far Eastern Republic]] invaded newly independent Mongolia to defeat Ungern. These forces included Red Mongolian leader [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]]. Spies and various smaller diversionary units went ahead to spread terror to weaken Ungern's forces. Ungern organized an expedition to meet these forces in Siberia and to support ongoing anti-Bolshevik rebellions. Believing he had the unwavering popular support of locals in Siberia and Mongolia, Ungern failed to properly strengthen his troops despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Red forces. However, unbeknownst to Ungern, the Reds had successfully crushed uprisings in Siberia and Soviet economic policies had temporarily softened in Lenin's [[New Economic Policy|NEP]]. Upon Ungern's arrival in Siberia, few local peasants and Cossacks volunteered to join him.\n\nIn the spring the Asiatic Cavalry Division was divided into two brigades: one under the command of Lt. Gen. Ungern and the second under Maj. Gen. Rezukhin. In May Rezukhin's brigade launched a raid beyond the Russian border to the west of the [[Selenga River]]. Ungern's brigade left Urga and slowly moved to the Russian town of Troitskosavsk (present-day [[Kyakhta]] in [[Buryatia]]). Meanwhile, the Reds moved large numbers of troops towards Mongolia from different directions. They had a tremendous advantage in equipment (armored cars, airplanes, rail, gunboats, ammunition, human reserves, etc.) and in number of troops. As a result, Ungern was defeated in battles that took place between 11 and 13 June and he failed to capture Troitskosavsk. Combined Bolshevik and Red Mongol forces [[Soviet occupation of Mongolia|entered Urga]] on 6 July 1921, after a few small skirmishes with Ungern's guard detachments.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[File:Ungern Von Sternberg before execution.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ungern-Sternberg before execution]]\nAlthough they had captured Urga, the Red forces failed to defeat the main forces of the Asiatic Division (Ungern's and Rezukhin's brigades). Ungern regrouped and attempted to invade Transbaikal across the Russo-Mongolian border. To rally his soldiers and local people, he quoted an agreement with Grigory Semyonov and pointed to a supposed Japanese offensive that was to support their drive, although neither Semyonov nor the Japanese were eager to assist him. After several days rest, on 18 July the Asiatic Division started its raid into Soviet territory. Eyewitnesses Kamil Gi\u017cycki and Mikhail Tornovsky gave similar estimates of their numbers: about 3000 men in total.{{sfn|Kuzmin|2004b}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Ungern's troops penetrated deep into Russian territory. The Soviets declared martial law in areas where the Whites were expected, including Verkhneudinsk (now [[Ulan-Ude]], the capital of Buryatia). Ungern's troops captured many settlements, the northernmost being [[Novoselenginsk]], which they occupied on 1 August. By this time Ungern understood that his offensive was ill-prepared; he also heard about the approach of large Red forces. On 2 August 1921 he began his retreat to Mongolia, where he declared his determination to fight [[Communism]]. While Ungern's troops wanted to abandon the war effort and head towards Manchuria to join with other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, it soon became clear that Ungern had other ideas. He wanted to retreat to [[Tuva]], then to Tibet. Troops under both Ungern and Rezukhin effectively mutinied and hatched plots to kill their respective commanders. On 17 August Rezukhin was murdered. A day later conspirators unsuccessfully tried to assassinate Ungern. His command then collapsed as his brigade broke apart. On 20 August Ungern was captured by a Soviet detachment led by guerrilla commander [[Petr Efimovich Shchetinkin|P. E. Shchetinkin]] (later a member of the [[Cheka]]).{{sfn|Kuzmin|2011|pp=228\u2013372}} After a [[show trial]] of six hours and 15 minutes on 15 September 1921, prosecuted by [[Yemelyan Yaroslavsky]], the Baron was sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]].
