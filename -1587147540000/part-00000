The musical was revived at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre]] in New York, directed by [[Stafford Arima]] from January until April 2012. On September 25, 2012, the first official cast recording was released. The new production is currently available to license for professional and amateur productions from Rodgers & Hammerstein Theatricals.\n*1990: ''Ghost Stories'' was an adaptation of Stephen King's short stories \"The Return of Timmy Baterman,\" about zombies; \"[[Strawberry Spring]],\" about a campus serial killer; \"[[Gray Matter (short story)|Gray Matter]],\" a black comedy about a hideous mutation caused by a bottle of beer; \"[[Uncle Otto's Truck]],\" and \"[[The Boogeyman (short story)|The Boogeyman]],\" about a distraught father's encounter with a child-killing closet monster, as well as selections from ''[[Pet Sematary]]''. Adapted and directed by Robert Pridham, the play premiered at the Arts Center Theatre at [[Kent Place School]] in Summit, New Jersey, and toured the United States in the mid-1990s.\n*1993: ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' stage play produced by [[Shane Black]] and directed by Jim Birge. Originally titled ''Getting It On'', it was intended to premiere in [[Jasper, Indiana]], but scheduling and venue issues forced it to move to the [[VFW]] in [[Santa Claus, Indiana]], where it ran from April 23 to May 1. Venue problems caused the final show, on May 2, to be canceled.\n*2005: ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' stage play by [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] based on 1987 novel.

Named after Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the ship was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when he was commissioned into the German fleet. ''Bismarck'' and his sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, [[Ernst Lindemann|Captain Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck'' conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. The ship, along with the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} initially engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', probably by mistake, while {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} engaged ''Bismarck''. In the ensuing battle ''Hood'' was destroyed by the combined fire of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', which then damaged ''Prince of Wales'' and forced her retreat. ''Bismarck'' suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of ''Hood'' spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for [[occupied France]] to effect repairs, ''Bismarck'' was attacked by 16 obsolescent [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[biplane]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|his final battle]] the following morning, the already-crippled ''Bismarck'' was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by his crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused him to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by [[Robert Ballard]], and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}} were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Bismarck'' and his [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Bb bismarck.png|thumb|left|3D rendering of ''Bismarck'' based on its configuration during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]]\n\n''Bismarck'' displaced {{convert|41,700|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{convert|50,300|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The battleship was Germany's largest warship,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=203}} and displaced more than any other European battleship, with the exception of {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}, commissioned after the end of the war.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|pp=16, 224}} ''Bismarck'' was powered by three [[Blohm+Voss|Blohm & Voss]] geared [[steam turbine]]s and twelve oil-fired Wagner [[Superheated steam|superheated]] [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]], which developed a total of {{convert|{{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.01|kn|lk=in}} on speed trials. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|8,870|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|19|kn}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Bismarck'' was equipped with three [[Seetakt|FuMO 23]] search [[radar]] sets, mounted on the forward and stern [[rangefinder]]s and foretop.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} The crew was divided into twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions were assigned to the ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|batteries]] and five and six manning [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The [[radio operator]]s, signalmen, and [[quartermaster]]s were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the [[engine room]] personnel. When ''Bismarck'' left port, fleet staff, [[prize crews]], and [[war correspondent]]s increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|pp=29\u201330}} Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}, which had been lost during [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the German invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=26}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew published a ship's newspaper titled ''Die Schiffsglocke'' (The Ship's Bell);{{sfn|Gr\u00fctzner|p=166}} this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=77}}\n\n''Bismarck'' was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34 guns]] arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|super-firing]] turrets forward\u2014\"Anton\" and \"Bruno\"\u2014and two aft\u2014\"Caesar\" and \"Dora\".{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Construktionsjahr'' (design year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the ''L\u00e4nge'' (length) of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the length of the gun barrel is 52 times greater than the caliber (internal diameter) of the gun barrel.{{sfn|Campbell 1985|p=219}}}} Secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/83]], and twelve [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] anti-aircraft guns. ''Bismarck'' also carried four [[Arado Ar 196]] reconnaissance [[floatplane]]s, with a single large hangar and a double-ended [[aircraft catapult|catapult]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} The ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

[[Adolf Hitler]] made the christening speech.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=10}} [[Fitting-out]] work followed the launch, during which time the original straight [[Stem (ship)|stem]] was replaced with a raked \"Atlantic bow\" similar to those of the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|1}}s.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}} ''Bismarck'' was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940 for [[sea trial]]s,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} which were conducted in the Baltic. ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' [[Ernst Lindemann]] took command of the ship at the time of commissioning.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nOn 15 September 1940, three weeks after commissioning, ''Bismarck'' left Hamburg to begin sea trials in [[Kiel Bay]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}} ''[[Sperrbrecher]] 13'' escorted the ship to [[Cape Arkona|Arcona]] on 28 September, and then on to [[Gotenhafen]] for trials in the [[Gulf of Danzig]].{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=38}} The ship's power-plant was given a thorough workout; ''Bismarck'' made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in his design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering [[propeller (ship)|propeller]] revolutions, the crew learned that ''Bismarck'' could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved he was a very stable gun platform.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|pp=44\u201345}} Trials lasted until December; ''Bismarck'' returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}}\n\nThe ship was scheduled to return to [[Kiel]] on 24 January 1941, but a merchant vessel had been sunk in the [[Kiel Canal]] and prevented use of the waterway. Severe weather hampered efforts to remove the wreck, and ''Bismarck'' was not able to reach Kiel until March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}} The delay greatly frustrated Lindemann, who remarked that \"[''Bismarck''] had been tied down at Hamburg for five weeks&nbsp;... the precious time at sea lost as a result cannot be made up, and a significant delay in the final war deployment of the ship thus is unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=39}} While waiting to reach Kiel, ''Bismarck'' hosted Captain Anders Forshell, the Swedish naval attach\u00e9 to Berlin. He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the [[Swedish Navy]]. The information provided the [[Royal Navy]] with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-41, Schlachtschiff \"Bismarck\".jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' on trials; the rangefinders had not yet been installed]]\n\nOn 6 March, ''Bismarck'' received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and a pair of [[Armed merchantman|armed merchant vessels]], along with an [[icebreaker]]. At 08:45 on 8 March, ''Bismarck'' briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; he was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where his crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of [[dazzle paint]] to camouflage him. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=40}} On 17 March, the old battleship {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, now used as an icebreaker, escorted ''Bismarck'' through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=41}}\n\nThe Naval High Command (''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or OKM), commanded by Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean. The two ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships were based in [[Brest, France]], at the time, having just completed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]], a major raid into the Atlantic. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sister ship ''Tirpitz'' rapidly approached completion. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were to sortie from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and rendezvous with the two ''Scharnhorst''-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nWork on ''Tirpitz'' was completed later than anticipated, and he was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in [[drydock]]. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=211}} Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}.

Four [[U-boat]]s would be placed along the convoy routes between [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and Britain to scout for the raiders.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nBy the start of the operation, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew had increased to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, ''Bismarck'' departed Gotenhafen and made for the [[Danish straits]]. He was joined at 11:25 by ''Prinz Eugen'', which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} The two ships were escorted by three [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{ship|German destroyer|Z10 Hans Lody||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, and {{ship|German destroyer|Z23||2}}\u2014and a [[flotilla]] of [[minesweeper]]s.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=76}} The [[Luftwaffe]] provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=64}}\n\nAn hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish [[cruiser]] {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}}; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the [[Kattegat]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} ''Gotland'' transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: \"Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10\u201312 aircraft passed [[Marstrand]], course 205\u00b0/20'.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by ''Gotland'', though both L\u00fctjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attach\u00e9 to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the [[Admiralty]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=66\u201367}} The code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had [[encryption|decrypted]] reports that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had taken on prize crews and requested additional [[navigational chart]]s from headquarters.

On the evening of 20 May, ''Bismarck'' and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board ''Prinz Eugen'' picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=114}} At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached [[Bergen]] and anchored at [[Grimstadfjord]], where the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard \"outboard grey\" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=83}}\n\n[[File:Bismarck reconnaissance.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial reconnaissance photo showing ''Bismarck'' anchored (on the right) in Norway]]\n\nWhen ''Bismarck'' was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect him from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of {{convert|8000|m|abbr=on}} and take photos of ''Bismarck'' and his escorts.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=84}} Upon receipt of the information, Admiral [[John Tovey]] ordered the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the [[Denmark Strait]].

The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off [[Trondheim]]. At around 12:00, L\u00fctjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the break-out into the open Atlantic.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=215}}\n\nBy 04:00 on 23 May, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to increase speed to {{convert|27|kn}} to make the dash through the Denmark Strait.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMO radar detection equipment sets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=126}} ''Bismarck'' led ''Prinz Eugen'' by about {{convert|700|m|yd|abbr=on}}; mist reduced visibility to {{convert|3000|\u2013|4000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to {{convert|24|kn}}. Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid [[Drift ice|ice floes]]. At 19:22, [[hydrophone]] and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser {{HMS|Suffolk|55|6}} at a range of approximately {{convert|12500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by ''Suffolk'' and learned that their location had been reported.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nL\u00fctjens gave permission for ''Prinz Eugen'' to engage ''Suffolk'', but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held  fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=127}} ''Suffolk'' quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} joined ''Suffolk'', but approached the German raiders too closely. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; ''Bismarck'' fired five salvoes, three of which straddled ''Norfolk'' and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38&nbsp;cm guns' firing disabled ''Bismarck''{{'}}s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted L\u00fctjens to order ''Prinz Eugen'' to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nAt around 22:00, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him. Although ''Bismarck'' was visually obscured in a rain squall, ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar quickly detected the manoeuvre, allowing the cruiser to evade.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=132}} The cruisers remained on station through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships. The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07, hydrophone operators aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of {{convert|20|nmi|abbr=on}}, reporting \"Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280\u00b0 relative bearing!\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\n==== Battle of the Denmark Strait ====\n{{main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}\n\nAt 05:45 on 24 May, German lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon; this turned out to be from ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'', under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]]. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships' crews to [[battle stations]]. By 05:52, the range had fallen to {{convert|26000|m|yd|abbr=on}} and ''Hood'' opened fire, followed by ''Prince of Wales'' a minute later.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=219\u2013220}} ''Hood'' engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', which the British thought to be ''Bismarck'', while ''Prince of Wales'' fired on ''Bismarck''.{{efn|The British were unaware that the German ships had reversed positions in the Denmark Strait.

Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20\u00b0 turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on ''Hood''. About a minute after opening fire, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a hit with a high-explosive {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} shell; the explosion detonated [[unrotated projectile]] ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=220}} After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to ''Hood''; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s eight 38&nbsp;cm guns. He also ordered the ship's 15&nbsp;cm secondary guns to engage ''Prince of Wales''. Holland then ordered a second 20\u00b0 turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=151\u2013152}} L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to shift fire and target ''Prince of Wales'', to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a pair of hits on the battleship that started a small fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nL\u00fctjens then ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to drop behind ''Bismarck'', so she could continue to monitor the location of ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'', which were still {{convert|10|to|12|nmi|abbr=on}} to the east. At 06:00, ''Hood'' was completing the second turn to port when ''Bismarck''{{'}}s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38&nbsp;cm [[armour-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing]] shells struck ''Hood'' and penetrated her thin deck armour. The shell reached ''Hood''{{'}}s rear ammunition magazine and detonated {{convert|112|t|LT|abbr=on}} of [[cordite]] propellant.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=153}} The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle.

The British battleship scored a hit on ''Bismarck'' with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found his mark with his first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on ''Prince of Wales'', though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]], the ship's commanding officer, and one other.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=176}} The two German ships continued to fire upon ''Prince of Wales'', causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=176\u2013177}} Despite the technical faults in the main battery, ''Prince of Wales'' scored three hits on ''Bismarck'' in the engagement. The first struck his in the [[forecastle]] above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the [[torpedo bulkhead]], completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nAt 06:13, Leach gave the order to retreat; only five{{sfn|Roskill|pp=406}} of his ship's ten {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} guns were still firing and his ship had sustained significant damage. ''Prince of Wales'' made a 160\u00b0 turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing ''Prince of Wales'' and destroying her,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=164\u2013165}} L\u00fctjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy,{{sfn|Kennedy|p=79}} firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to head for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=165\u2013166}} In the engagement, ''Bismarck'' had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=223}} The forecastle hit allowed {{convert|1000|to|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. L\u00fctjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=224}} The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as ''Bismarck'' had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree [[List (watercraft)|list]] to port and a 3-degree [[wikt:trim#Noun|trim]] by the bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=226}}\n\n==== Chase ====\n[[File:Map Rheinuebung.svg|thumb|Map showing the course of ''Bismarck'' and the ships that pursued her]]\nAfter the engagement, L\u00fctjens reported, \"Battlecruiser, probably ''Hood'', sunk.

After confirming \"broad streams of oil on both sides of [''Bismarck''{{'}}s] wake\",{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} ''Prinz Eugen'' returned to the forward position.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} About an hour later, a British [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] reported the oil slick to ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'', which had been joined by the damaged ''Prince of Wales''. Rear Admiral [[Frederic Wake-Walker]], the commander of the two cruisers, ordered ''Prince of Wales'' to remain behind his ships.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. Tovey's Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over {{convert|350|nmi|abbr=on}} away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers {{HMS|Manchester|15|2}}, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|2}}, and {{HMS|Arethusa|26|2}} to patrol the Denmark Strait in the event that L\u00fctjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, which had been escorting {{RMS|Britannic|1929|6}} and was due for a refit in the [[Boston Navy Yard]], joined Tovey. Two old {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|1}}s were ordered into the hunt:  {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}}, from Halifax, and {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, which was escorting Convoy HX 127.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=174\u2013175}} In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} By around 17:00, the crew aboard ''Prince of Wales'' restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack ''Bismarck'' if the opportunity arose.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=175}}\n\nWith the weather worsening, L\u00fctjens attempted to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. ''Prinz Eugen'' was therefore recalled temporarily.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=192\u2013193}} The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. ''Bismarck'' turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing ''Suffolk'' to turn away at high speed. ''Prince of Wales'' fired twelve salvos at ''Bismarck'', which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted ''Prinz Eugen'' to slip away. After ''Bismarck'' resumed his previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=227}}\n\nAlthough ''Bismarck'' had been damaged in the engagement and forced to reduce speed, he was still capable of reaching {{convert|27|to|28|kn}}, the maximum speed of Tovey's {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}. Unless ''Bismarck'' could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent him from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her [[torpedo bomber]]s.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=194\u2013195}} At 22:00, ''Victorious'' launched the strike, which comprised six [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters and nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[825 Naval Air Squadron]], led by Lt Cdr [[Eugene Esmonde]]. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked ''Norfolk'' and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter [[USCGC Modoc (WPG-46)|USCGC ''Modoc'']] on their approach; the confusion alerted ''Bismarck''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}}\n\n''Bismarck'' also used his main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=189}} None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. ''Bismarck'' evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}} struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=229\u2013230}} The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to {{convert|16|kn}}. Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to {{convert|20|kn}}, the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=230}}\n\nShortly after the Swordfish departed from the scene, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=192\u2013193}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to {{convert|12|kn}} to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=226}}\n\nAs the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, ''Bismarck'' was out of range of ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=229\u2013230}} At 03:00 on 25 May, L\u00fctjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was {{convert|28|kn}}. He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; ''Bismarck'' successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind his pursuers. ''Suffolk''{{'}}s captain assumed that ''Bismarck'' had broken off to the west and attempted to find him by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\nThe Royal Navy search became frantic, as many of the British ships were low on fuel. ''Victorious'' and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. [[Force H]], with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and steaming up from [[Gibraltar]], was still at least a day away.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=232\u2013233}} Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, L\u00fctjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board ''King George V'', leading Tovey to believe that ''Bismarck'' was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, ''Bismarck'' had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=231}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|left|The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} with a flight of Swordfish overhead]]\n\nBritish code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for ''Bismarck'' making for Brest, decrypted by [[Jane Fawcett]] on 25 May 1941.{{sfn|Schudel}} The [[French Resistance]] provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which ''Bismarck'' would have to pass.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=232}} A squadron of Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]]s based in [[Northern Ireland]] joined the search, covering areas where ''Bismarck'' might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign [[Leonard B.

Most British forces were not close enough to stop him.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=233}}\n\nThe only possibility for the Royal Navy was ''Ark Royal'' with Force H, under the command of Admiral [[James Somerville]].{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=234}} ''Victorious'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Suffolk'' and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortage; the only heavy ships remaining apart from Force H were ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'', but they were too distant.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=233}} ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s Swordfish were already searching nearby when the Catalina found her. Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} away from ''Ark Royal''. Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} to shadow ''Bismarck'', though ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aviators were not informed of this.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=235}} As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with new magnetic [[detonator]]s, accidentally attacked ''Sheffield''. The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and ''Sheffield'' emerged unscathed.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal swordfish.jpg|thumb|A Swordfish returns to ''Ark Royal'' after making the torpedo attack against ''Bismarck'']]\n\nUpon returning to ''Ark Royal'', the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=258\u2013259}} As the Swordfish approached, ''Bismarck'' fired his main battery at ''Sheffield'', straddling the cruiser with his second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on ''Sheffield'', killing three men and wounding several others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=259}} ''Sheffield'' quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; ''Bismarck'' began to turn violently as his anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=259\u2013261}} One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=234}}\n\nThe second torpedo struck ''Bismarck'' in his stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12\u00b0 turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by L\u00fctjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=234\u2013236}}{{sfn|Kennedy|p=211}} At 21:15, L\u00fctjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=237}}\n\n==== Sinking ====\n{{main|Last battle of the battleship Bismarck}}\n\nWith the port rudder jammed, ''Bismarck'' was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'' were still available, along with the heavy cruisers ''Dorsetshire'' and ''Norfolk''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=271\u2013272}} L\u00fctjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: \"Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=182}} The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=256\u2013257}} As darkness fell, ''Bismarck'' briefly fired on ''Sheffield'', though the cruiser quickly fled. ''Sheffield'' lost contact in the low visibility and Captain [[Philip Vian]]'s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with ''Bismarck'' through the night.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=279}}\n\nThe ships encountered ''Bismarck'' at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with his main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}}. The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around {{convert|12000|m|abbr=on}} forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried ''Bismarck'', illuminating him with [[star shell]]s and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with ''Hood'', and other important documents. The third shell hit from ''Prince of Wales'' had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Rodney firing on Bismarck.png|thumb|upright=1.3|''Rodney'' firing on ''Bismarck'', which can be seen burning in the distance]]\n\nAfter daybreak on 27 May, ''King George V'' led the attack. ''Rodney'' followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at ''Bismarck'' until he was about {{convert|8|nmi|abbr=on}} away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=286\u2013287}} At 08:43, lookouts on ''King George V'' spotted her, some {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}} away. Four minutes later, ''Rodney''{{'}}s two forward turrets, comprising six {{convert|16|in|0|abbr=on}} guns, opened fire, then ''King George V''{{'}}s {{convert|14|in|0|abbr=on}} guns began firing. ''Bismarck'' returned fire at 08:50 with his forward guns; with his second salvo, he straddled ''Rodney''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=288\u2013289}} Thereafter, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s ability to aim his guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=268}}\n\nAs the range fell, the ships' secondary batteries joined the battle. ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' closed and began firing with their {{convert|8|in|0|abbr=on}} guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' struck ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward [[superstructure]], killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and L\u00fctjens and the rest of the bridge staff,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=290\u2013291}} although other survivors stated that they saw Lindemann on the deck as the ship sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it would manage to fire one last salvo at 09:27.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=269}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=239}} Lieutenant von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells exploded 20 feet off ''Rodney''{{' }}s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube\u2014the closest ''Bismarck'' came to a direct hit on his opponents.{{sfn|Kennedy|p=246}}\n\nBy 10:00, Tovey's two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range; ''Bismarck'' had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern. He was slowly settling by the stern from uncontrolled flooding with a 20 degree list to port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=292\u2013294}} ''Rodney'' closed to {{convert|2700|m|yd|abbr=on}}, [[point-blank range]] for guns of that size, and continued to fire.

The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate as they made their way up through the various levels.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=281}} Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=295}}\n\nThe four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at ''Bismarck'', and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink ''Bismarck'' by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' to sink ''Bismarck'' with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port.{{sfn|McGowen|p=56}} ''Dorsetshire'' fired a pair of torpedoes into ''Bismarck''{{'}}s starboard side, one of which hit. ''Dorsetshire'' then moved around to his port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=281}} It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} Around 10:35, ''Bismarck'' capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}} Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as he sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}}\n\nJunack, who had abandoned ship by the time it capsized, observed no underwater damage to the ship's starboard side.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} Von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg reported the same but assumed that the port side, which was then under water, had been more significantly damaged.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} Around 400 men were now in the water;{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} ''Dorsetshire'' and the destroyer {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}} moved in and lowered ropes to pull the survivors aboard. At 11:40, ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s captain ordered the rescue effort abandoned after lookouts spotted what they thought was a U-boat. ''Dorsetshire'' had rescued 85 men and ''Maori'' had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=297}} A U-boat later reached the survivors and found three men, and a German trawler rescued another two. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}}\n\nIn 1959, [[C. S. Forester]] published his novel ''[[Last Nine Days of the Bismarck]].'' The book was adapted for the movie ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]],'' released the following year. For dramatic effect the film showed ''Bismarck'' sinking a British destroyer and shooting down two aircraft, neither of which happened.{{sfn|Niemi|p=99}} That same year, [[Johnny Horton]] released the song \"[[Sink the Bismark]]\".{{sfn|Polmar & Cavas|p=251}}\n\n== Wreckage ==\n\n=== Discovery by Robert Ballard ===\n[[File:Bismarck illustration.png|thumb|upright|Painting by [[Ken Marschall]] depicting [[Argo (ROV)|''Argo'']] exploring the wreck]]\nThe wreck of ''Bismarck'' was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], the [[oceanographer]] responsible for finding {{RMS|Titanic}}. ''Bismarck'' was found to be resting on its keel at a depth of approximately {{convert|4791|m|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=221}} about {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding [[abyssal plain]], triggering a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} [[landslide]]. ''Bismarck'' slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down. Ballard kept the wreck's exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts<!--this is the correct spelling; \"artefact\" is the British English spelling of the word. Please do not change it.--> from the ship, a practice he considered a form of [[grave robbing]].{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=216, 221}}\n\nBallard's survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship's fully armoured [[Citadel#Naval term|citadel]]. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=194}} Six holes are [[amidships]], three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=214}} Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=191}} Huge dents showed that many of the 14&nbsp;inch shells fired by ''King George V'' bounced off the German belt armour.{{sfn|Jackson|p=85}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin noted that the British battleships were shooting at very close range; the flat trajectory of the shells made it difficult to hit the relatively narrow target represented by the belt armour above the waterline, as shells that fell short would either ricochet up into the superstructure or explode on striking the water.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1994}}\n\nBallard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that \"''Bismarck'' did not implode.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=214\u2013215}} This suggests that ''Bismarck''{{'}}s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory.{{sfn|Jackson|p=88}} Ballard added \"we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact\". They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by his crew, as claimed by German survivors.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\nThe whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=177\u2013178}} The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank \"stern first\" and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 ''Prinz Eugen'' was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\n=== Subsequent expeditions ===\nIn June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built [[Submersible|mini-submarines]]. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, \"You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nAn Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano\u2014the only one in that area\u2014to locate the wreck. Using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader [[David Mearns]] claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: \"My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes\".{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nThe 2002 documentary ''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]] and filmed in May\u2013June 2002 using smaller and more agile [[Mir (submersible)|Mir submersibles]], reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that there was not enough damage below the waterline to confirm that he had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nDespite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that ''Bismarck'' would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled him first. Ballard estimated that ''Bismarck'' could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving  on the destroyer {{HMS|Tartar|F43|6}} at the time). Kennedy stated, \"That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}} When asked whether ''Bismarck'' would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied \"Sure. But it might have taken half a day.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} In Mearns' subsequent book ''Hood and Bismarck'', he conceded that scuttling \"may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} Ballard later concluded that \"As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Archaeological Oceanography''|p=111}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unsinkable Sam]] \u2013 cat which is said to have survived the sinking of ''Bismarck''\n\n== Footnotes

Named after Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the ship was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. ''Bismarck'' and her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, [[Ernst Lindemann|Captain Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck'' conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. The ship, along with the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} initially engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', probably by mistake, while {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} engaged ''Bismarck''. In the ensuing battle ''Hood'' was destroyed by the combined fire of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', which then damaged ''Prince of Wales'' and forced her retreat. ''Bismarck'' suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of ''Hood'' spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for [[occupied France]] to effect repairs, ''Bismarck'' was attacked by 16 obsolescent [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[biplane]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her final battle]] the following morning, the already-crippled ''Bismarck'' was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers,  was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by [[Robert Ballard]], and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Bismarck'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Bb bismarck.png|thumb|left|3D rendering of ''Bismarck'' based on its configuration during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]]\n\n''Bismarck'' displaced {{convert|41,700|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{convert|50,300|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The battleship was Germany's largest warship,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=203}} and displaced more than any other European battleship, with the exception of {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}, commissioned after the end of the war.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|pp=16, 224}} ''Bismarck'' was powered by three [[Blohm+Voss|Blohm & Voss]] geared [[steam turbine]]s and twelve oil-fired Wagner [[Superheated steam|superheated]] [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]], which developed a total of {{convert|{{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.01|kn|lk=in}} on speed trials. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|8,870|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|19|kn}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Bismarck'' was equipped with three [[Seetakt|FuMO 23]] search [[radar]] sets, mounted on the forward and stern [[rangefinder]]s and foretop.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} The crew was divided into twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions were assigned to the ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|batteries]] and five and six manning [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The [[radio operator]]s, signalmen, and [[quartermaster]]s were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the [[engine room]] personnel. When ''Bismarck'' left port, fleet staff, [[prize crews]], and [[war correspondent]]s increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|pp=29\u201330}} Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}, which had been lost during [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the German invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=26}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew published a ship's newspaper titled ''Die Schiffsglocke'' (The Ship's Bell);{{sfn|Gr\u00fctzner|p=166}} this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=77}}\n\n''Bismarck'' was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34 guns]] arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|super-firing]] turrets forward\u2014\"Anton\" and \"Bruno\"\u2014and two aft\u2014\"Caesar\" and \"Dora\".{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Construktionsjahr'' (design year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the ''L\u00e4nge'' (length) of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the length of the gun barrel is 52 times greater than the caliber (internal diameter) of the gun barrel.{{sfn|Campbell 1985|p=219}}}} Secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/83]], and twelve [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] anti-aircraft guns. ''Bismarck'' also carried four [[Arado Ar 196]] reconnaissance [[floatplane]]s, with a single large hangar and a double-ended [[aircraft catapult|catapult]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} The ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively. The {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} turrets were protected by {{convert|360|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick faces and {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\n== Service history ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1361-16A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, Indienststellung.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' in port in Hamburg]]\n''Bismarck'' was ordered under the name ''Ersatz Hannover'' (\"''Hannover'' replacement\"), a replacement for the old [[pre-dreadnought]] {{SMS|Hannover}}, under contract \"F\".{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The contract was awarded to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where the [[keel]] was laid on 1 July 1936 at Helgen IX.{{sfn|Campbell 1987|p=43}}{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=10}} The ship was launched on 14 February 1939 and during the elaborate ceremonies was christened by Dorothee von L\u00f6wenfeld, granddaughter of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the ship's namesake. [[Adolf Hitler]] made the christening speech.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|p=10}} [[Fitting-out]] work followed the launch, during which time the original straight [[Stem (ship)|stem]] was replaced with a raked \"Atlantic bow\" similar to those of the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|1}}s.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}} ''Bismarck'' was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940 for [[sea trial]]s,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} which were conducted in the Baltic. ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' [[Ernst Lindemann]] took command of the ship at the time of commissioning.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nOn 15 September 1940, three weeks after commissioning, ''Bismarck'' left Hamburg to begin sea trials in [[Kiel Bay]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}} ''[[Sperrbrecher]] 13'' escorted the ship to [[Cape Arkona|Arcona]] on 28 September, and then on to [[Gotenhafen]] for trials in the [[Gulf of Danzig]].{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=38}} The ship's power-plant was given a thorough workout; ''Bismarck'' made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering [[propeller (ship)|propeller]] revolutions, the crew learned that ''Bismarck'' could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|pp=44\u201345}} Trials lasted until December; ''Bismarck'' returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}}\n\nThe ship was scheduled to return to [[Kiel]] on 24 January 1941, but a merchant vessel had been sunk in the [[Kiel Canal]] and prevented use of the waterway. Severe weather hampered efforts to remove the wreck, and ''Bismarck'' was not able to reach Kiel until March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}} The delay greatly frustrated Lindemann, who remarked that \"[''Bismarck''] had been tied down at Hamburg for five weeks&nbsp;... the precious time at sea lost as a result cannot be made up, and a significant delay in the final war deployment of the ship thus is unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=39}} While waiting to reach Kiel, ''Bismarck'' hosted Captain Anders Forshell, the Swedish naval attach\u00e9 to Berlin. He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the [[Swedish Navy]]. The information provided the [[Royal Navy]] with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-41, Schlachtschiff \"Bismarck\".jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' on trials; the rangefinders had not yet been installed]]\n\nOn 6 March, ''Bismarck'' received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and a pair of [[Armed merchantman|armed merchant vessels]], along with an [[icebreaker]]. At 08:45 on 8 March, ''Bismarck'' briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of [[dazzle paint]] to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=40}} On 17 March, the old battleship {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, now used as an icebreaker, escorted ''Bismarck'' through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=41}}\n\nThe Naval High Command (''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or OKM), commanded by Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean. The two ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships were based in [[Brest, France]], at the time, having just completed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]], a major raid into the Atlantic. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sister ship ''Tirpitz'' rapidly approached completion. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were to sortie from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and rendezvous with the two ''Scharnhorst''-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nWork on ''Tirpitz'' was completed later than anticipated, and she was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in [[drydock]]. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=211}} Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}. The two ships would not be ready for action until July or August.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=43}} Admiral [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]], ''Flottenchef'' (Fleet Chief) of the Kriegsmarine, chosen to lead the operation, wished to delay the operation at least until either ''Scharnhorst'' or ''Tirpitz'' became available,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=44\u201345}} but the OKM decided to proceed with the operation, codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]], with a force consisting of only ''Bismarck'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=211}} At a final meeting with Raeder in Paris on 26 April, L\u00fctjens was encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy gaining any respite.{{sfn|Boog, Rahn, Stumpf & Wegner|p=132}}\n\n=== Operation Rhein\u00fcbung ===\n{{main|Operation Rhein\u00fcbung}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-012-03, Schlachtschiff Bismarck in der Ostsee.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'', photographed from ''Prinz Eugen'', in the Baltic at the outset of Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]]\n\nOn 5 May 1941, Hitler and [[Wilhelm Keitel]], with a large entourage, arrived to view ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' in Gotenhafen. The men were given an extensive tour of the ships, after which Hitler met with L\u00fctjens to discuss the upcoming mission.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=71}} On 16 May, L\u00fctjens reported that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' were fully prepared for Operation Rhein\u00fcbung; he was therefore ordered to proceed with the mission on the evening of 19 May.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=74}} As part of the operational plans, a group of eighteen supply ships would be positioned to support ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. Four [[U-boat]]s would be placed along the convoy routes between [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and Britain to scout for the raiders.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nBy the start of the operation, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew had increased to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, ''Bismarck'' departed Gotenhafen and made for the [[Danish straits]]. She was joined at 11:25 by ''Prinz Eugen'', which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} The two ships were escorted by three [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{ship|German destroyer|Z10 Hans Lody||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, and {{ship|German destroyer|Z23||2}}\u2014and a [[flotilla]] of [[minesweeper]]s.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=76}} The [[Luftwaffe]] provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=64}}\n\nAn hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish [[cruiser]] {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}}; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the [[Kattegat]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} ''Gotland'' transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: \"Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10\u201312 aircraft passed [[Marstrand]], course 205\u00b0/20'.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by ''Gotland'', though both L\u00fctjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attach\u00e9 to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the [[Admiralty]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=66\u201367}} The code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had [[encryption|decrypted]] reports that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had taken on prize crews and requested additional [[navigational chart]]s from headquarters. A pair of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s was ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the flotilla.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=68}}\n\nGerman aerial reconnaissance confirmed that one [[aircraft carrier]], three battleships, and four cruisers remained at anchor in the main British naval base at [[Scapa Flow]], which confirmed to L\u00fctjens that the British were unaware of his operation. On the evening of 20 May, ''Bismarck'' and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board ''Prinz Eugen'' picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=114}} At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached [[Bergen]] and anchored at [[Grimstadfjord]], where the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard \"outboard grey\" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=83}}\n\n[[File:Bismarck reconnaissance.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial reconnaissance photo showing ''Bismarck'' anchored (on the right) in Norway]]\n\nWhen ''Bismarck'' was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect her from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of {{convert|8000|m|abbr=on}} and take photos of ''Bismarck'' and her escorts.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=84}} Upon receipt of the information, Admiral [[John Tovey]] ordered the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the [[Denmark Strait]]. The rest of the [[Home Fleet]] was placed on high alert in Scapa Flow. Eighteen bombers were dispatched to attack the Germans, but weather over the [[fjord]] had worsened and they were unable to find the German warships.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=120}}\n\n''Bismarck'' did not replenish her fuel stores in Norway, as her operational orders did not require her to do so. She had left port {{convert|200|t|LT|abbr=on}} short of a full load, and had since expended another {{convert|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} on the voyage from Gotenhafen. ''Prinz Eugen'' took on {{convert|764|t|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=71}} At 19:30 on 21 May, ''Bismarck'', ''Prinz Eugen'', and the three escorting destroyers left Bergen.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=72}} At midnight, when the force was in the open sea, heading towards the Arctic Ocean, Raeder disclosed the operation to Hitler, who reluctantly consented to the raid. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off [[Trondheim]]. At around 12:00, L\u00fctjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the break-out into the open Atlantic.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=215}}\n\nBy 04:00 on 23 May, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to increase speed to {{convert|27|kn}} to make the dash through the Denmark Strait.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMO radar detection equipment sets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=126}} ''Bismarck'' led ''Prinz Eugen'' by about {{convert|700|m|yd|abbr=on}}; mist reduced visibility to {{convert|3000|\u2013|4000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to {{convert|24|kn}}. Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid [[Drift ice|ice floes]]. At 19:22, [[hydrophone]] and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser {{HMS|Suffolk|55|6}} at a range of approximately {{convert|12500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by ''Suffolk'' and learned that their location had been reported.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nL\u00fctjens gave permission for ''Prinz Eugen'' to engage ''Suffolk'', but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held  fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=127}} ''Suffolk'' quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} joined ''Suffolk'', but approached the German raiders too closely. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; ''Bismarck'' fired five salvoes, three of which straddled ''Norfolk'' and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38&nbsp;cm guns' firing disabled ''Bismarck''{{'}}s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted L\u00fctjens to order ''Prinz Eugen'' to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nAt around 22:00, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him. Although ''Bismarck'' was visually obscured in a rain squall, ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar quickly detected the manoeuvre, allowing the cruiser to evade.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=132}} The cruisers remained on station through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships. The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07, hydrophone operators aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of {{convert|20|nmi|abbr=on}}, reporting \"Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280\u00b0 relative bearing!\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\n==== Battle of the Denmark Strait ====\n{{main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}\n\nAt 05:45 on 24 May, German lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon; this turned out to be from ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'', under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]]. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships' crews to [[battle stations]]. By 05:52, the range had fallen to {{convert|26000|m|yd|abbr=on}} and ''Hood'' opened fire, followed by ''Prince of Wales'' a minute later.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=219\u2013220}} ''Hood'' engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', which the British thought to be ''Bismarck'', while ''Prince of Wales'' fired on ''Bismarck''.{{efn|The British were unaware that the German ships had reversed positions in the Denmark Strait.

Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20\u00b0 turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on ''Hood''. About a minute after opening fire, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a hit with a high-explosive {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} shell; the explosion detonated [[unrotated projectile]] ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=220}} After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to ''Hood''; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s eight 38&nbsp;cm guns. He also ordered the ship's 15&nbsp;cm secondary guns to engage ''Prince of Wales''. Holland then ordered a second 20\u00b0 turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=151\u2013152}} L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to shift fire and target ''Prince of Wales'', to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a pair of hits on the battleship that started a small fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nL\u00fctjens then ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to drop behind ''Bismarck'', so she could continue to monitor the location of ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'', which were still {{convert|10|to|12|nmi|abbr=on}} to the east. At 06:00, ''Hood'' was completing the second turn to port when ''Bismarck''{{'}}s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38&nbsp;cm [[armour-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing]] shells struck ''Hood'' and penetrated her thin deck armour. The shell reached ''Hood''{{'}}s rear ammunition magazine and detonated {{convert|112|t|LT|abbr=on}} of [[cordite]] propellant.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=153}} The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle.

The British battleship scored a hit on ''Bismarck'' with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on ''Prince of Wales'', though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]], the ship's commanding officer, and one other.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=176}} The two German ships continued to fire upon ''Prince of Wales'', causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=176\u2013177}} Despite the technical faults in the main battery, ''Prince of Wales'' scored three hits on ''Bismarck'' in the engagement. The first struck her in the [[forecastle]] above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the [[torpedo bulkhead]], completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nAt 06:13, Leach gave the order to retreat; only five{{sfn|Roskill|pp=406}} of his ship's ten {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} guns were still firing and his ship had sustained significant damage. ''Prince of Wales'' made a 160\u00b0 turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing ''Prince of Wales'' and destroying her,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=164\u2013165}} L\u00fctjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy,{{sfn|Kennedy|p=79}} firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to head for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=165\u2013166}} In the engagement, ''Bismarck'' had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=223}} The forecastle hit allowed {{convert|1000|to|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. L\u00fctjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=224}} The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as ''Bismarck'' had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree [[List (watercraft)|list]] to port and a 3-degree [[wikt:trim#Noun|trim]] by the bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=226}}\n\n==== Chase ====\n[[File:Map Rheinuebung.svg|thumb|Map showing the course of ''Bismarck'' and the ships that pursued her]]\nAfter the engagement, L\u00fctjens reported, \"Battlecruiser, probably ''Hood'', sunk.

After confirming \"broad streams of oil on both sides of [''Bismarck''{{'}}s] wake\",{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} ''Prinz Eugen'' returned to the forward position.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} About an hour later, a British [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] reported the oil slick to ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'', which had been joined by the damaged ''Prince of Wales''. Rear Admiral [[Frederic Wake-Walker]], the commander of the two cruisers, ordered ''Prince of Wales'' to remain behind his ships.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. Tovey's Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over {{convert|350|nmi|abbr=on}} away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers {{HMS|Manchester|15|2}}, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|2}}, and {{HMS|Arethusa|26|2}} to patrol the Denmark Strait in the event that L\u00fctjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, which had been escorting {{RMS|Britannic|1929|6}} and was due for a refit in the [[Boston Navy Yard]], joined Tovey. Two old {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|1}}s were ordered into the hunt:  {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}}, from Halifax, and {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, which was escorting Convoy HX 127.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=174\u2013175}} In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} By around 17:00, the crew aboard ''Prince of Wales'' restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack ''Bismarck'' if the opportunity arose.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=175}}\n\nWith the weather worsening, L\u00fctjens attempted to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. ''Prinz Eugen'' was therefore recalled temporarily.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=192\u2013193}} The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. ''Bismarck'' turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing ''Suffolk'' to turn away at high speed. ''Prince of Wales'' fired twelve salvos at ''Bismarck'', which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted ''Prinz Eugen'' to slip away. After ''Bismarck'' resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=227}}\n\nAlthough ''Bismarck'' had been damaged in the engagement and forced to reduce speed, she was still capable of reaching {{convert|27|to|28|kn}}, the maximum speed of Tovey's {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}. Unless ''Bismarck'' could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent her from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her [[torpedo bomber]]s.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=194\u2013195}} At 22:00, ''Victorious'' launched the strike, which comprised six [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters and nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[825 Naval Air Squadron]], led by Lt Cdr [[Eugene Esmonde]]. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked ''Norfolk'' and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter [[USCGC Modoc (WPG-46)|USCGC ''Modoc'']] on their approach; the confusion alerted ''Bismarck''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}}\n\n''Bismarck'' also used her main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=189}} None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. ''Bismarck'' evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}} struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=229\u2013230}} The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to {{convert|16|kn}}. Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to {{convert|20|kn}}, the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=230}}\n\nShortly after the Swordfish departed from the scene, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=192\u2013193}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to {{convert|12|kn}} to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=226}}\n\nAs the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, ''Bismarck'' was out of range of ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=229\u2013230}} At 03:00 on 25 May, L\u00fctjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was {{convert|28|kn}}. He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; ''Bismarck'' successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. ''Suffolk''{{'}}s captain assumed that ''Bismarck'' had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\nThe Royal Navy search became frantic, as many of the British ships were low on fuel. ''Victorious'' and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. [[Force H]], with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and steaming up from [[Gibraltar]], was still at least a day away.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=232\u2013233}} Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, L\u00fctjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board ''King George V'', leading Tovey to believe that ''Bismarck'' was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, ''Bismarck'' had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=231}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|left|The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} with a flight of Swordfish overhead]]\n\nBritish code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for ''Bismarck'' making for Brest, decrypted by [[Jane Fawcett]] on 25 May 1941.{{sfn|Schudel}} The [[French Resistance]] provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which ''Bismarck'' would have to pass.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=232}} A squadron of Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]]s based in [[Northern Ireland]] joined the search, covering areas where ''Bismarck'' might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign [[Leonard B.

Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} away from ''Ark Royal''. Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} to shadow ''Bismarck'', though ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aviators were not informed of this.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=235}} As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with new magnetic [[detonator]]s, accidentally attacked ''Sheffield''. The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and ''Sheffield'' emerged unscathed.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal swordfish.jpg|thumb|A Swordfish returns to ''Ark Royal'' after making the torpedo attack against ''Bismarck'']]\n\nUpon returning to ''Ark Royal'', the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators.

Shell fragments rained down on ''Sheffield'', killing three men and wounding several others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=259}} ''Sheffield'' quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; ''Bismarck'' began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=259\u2013261}} One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=234}}\n\nThe second torpedo struck ''Bismarck'' in her stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12\u00b0 turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by L\u00fctjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=234\u2013236}}{{sfn|Kennedy|p=211}} At 21:15, L\u00fctjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=237}}\n\n==== Sinking ====\n{{main|Last battle of the battleship Bismarck}}\n\nWith the port rudder jammed, ''Bismarck'' was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'' were still available, along with the heavy cruisers ''Dorsetshire'' and ''Norfolk''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=271\u2013272}} L\u00fctjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: \"Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=182}} The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=256\u2013257}} As darkness fell, ''Bismarck'' briefly fired on ''Sheffield'', though the cruiser quickly fled. ''Sheffield'' lost contact in the low visibility and Captain [[Philip Vian]]'s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with ''Bismarck'' through the night.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=279}}\n\nThe ships encountered ''Bismarck'' at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with her main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}}. The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around {{convert|12000|m|abbr=on}} forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried ''Bismarck'', illuminating her with [[star shell]]s and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with ''Hood'', and other important documents. The third shell hit from ''Prince of Wales'' had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Rodney firing on Bismarck.png|thumb|upright=1.3|''Rodney'' firing on ''Bismarck'', which can be seen burning in the distance]]\n\nAfter daybreak on 27 May, ''King George V'' led the attack. ''Rodney'' followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at ''Bismarck'' until he was about {{convert|8|nmi|abbr=on}} away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=286\u2013287}} At 08:43, lookouts on ''King George V'' spotted her, some {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}} away. Four minutes later, ''Rodney''{{'}}s two forward turrets, comprising six {{convert|16|in|0|abbr=on}} guns, opened fire, then ''King George V''{{'}}s {{convert|14|in|0|abbr=on}} guns began firing. ''Bismarck'' returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled ''Rodney''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=288\u2013289}} Thereafter, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s ability to aim her guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=268}}\n\nAs the range fell, the ships' secondary batteries joined the battle. ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' closed and began firing with their {{convert|8|in|0|abbr=on}} guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' struck ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward [[superstructure]], killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and L\u00fctjens and the rest of the bridge staff,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=290\u2013291}} although other survivors stated that they saw Lindemann on the deck as the ship sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it would manage to fire one last salvo at 09:27.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=269}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=239}} Lieutenant von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells exploded 20 feet off ''Rodney''{{' }}s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube\u2014the closest ''Bismarck'' came to a direct hit on her opponents.{{sfn|Kennedy|p=246}}\n\nBy 10:00, Tovey's two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range; ''Bismarck'' had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern. She was slowly settling by the stern from uncontrolled flooding with a 20 degree list to port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=292\u2013294}} ''Rodney'' closed to {{convert|2700|m|yd|abbr=on}}, [[point-blank range]] for guns of that size, and continued to fire. Tovey could not cease fire until the Germans [[Striking the colors|struck their ensigns]] or it became clear they were abandoning ship.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=292\u2013293}} ''Rodney'' fired two torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit.{{sfn|Gatacre|p=140}} According to [[Ludovic Kennedy]], \"if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another\".{{sfn|Kennedy|p=246}}\n\n[[File:HMS Dorsetshire Bismarck survivors.jpg|thumb|upright|left|HMS ''Dorsetshire'' picking up survivors]]\n\nFirst Officer Hans Oels ordered the men below decks to abandon ship; he instructed the engine room crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=293}} Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate as they made their way up through the various levels.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=281}} Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=295}}\n\nThe four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at ''Bismarck'', and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink ''Bismarck'' by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' to sink ''Bismarck'' with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port.{{sfn|McGowen|p=56}} ''Dorsetshire'' fired a pair of torpedoes into ''Bismarck''{{'}}s starboard side, one of which hit. ''Dorsetshire'' then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=281}} It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} Around 10:35, ''Bismarck'' capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}} Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}}\n\nJunack, who had abandoned ship by the time it capsized, observed no underwater damage to the ship's starboard side.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} Von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg reported the same but assumed that the port side, which was then under water, had been more significantly damaged.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} Around 400 men were now in the water;{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} ''Dorsetshire'' and the destroyer {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}} moved in and lowered ropes to pull the survivors aboard. At 11:40, ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s captain ordered the rescue effort abandoned after lookouts spotted what they thought was a U-boat. ''Dorsetshire'' had rescued 85 men and ''Maori'' had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=297}} A U-boat later reached the survivors and found three men, and a German trawler rescued another two. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}}\n\nIn 1959, [[C. S. Forester]] published his novel ''[[Last Nine Days of the Bismarck]].'' The book was adapted for the movie ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]],'' released the following year. For dramatic effect the film showed ''Bismarck'' sinking a British destroyer and shooting down two aircraft, neither of which happened.{{sfn|Niemi|p=99}} That same year, [[Johnny Horton]] released the song \"[[Sink the Bismark]]\".{{sfn|Polmar & Cavas|p=251}}\n\n== Wreckage ==\n\n=== Discovery by Robert Ballard ===\n[[File:Bismarck illustration.png|thumb|upright|Painting by [[Ken Marschall]] depicting [[Argo (ROV)|''Argo'']] exploring the wreck]]\nThe wreck of ''Bismarck'' was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], the [[oceanographer]] responsible for finding {{RMS|Titanic}}. ''Bismarck'' was found to be resting on its keel at a depth of approximately {{convert|4791|m|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=221}} about {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding [[abyssal plain]], triggering a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} [[landslide]]. ''Bismarck'' slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down. Ballard kept the wreck's exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts<!--this is the correct spelling; \"artefact\" is the British English spelling of the word. Please do not change it.--> from the ship, a practice he considered a form of [[grave robbing]].{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=216, 221}}\n\nBallard's survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship's fully armoured [[Citadel#Naval term|citadel]]. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=194}} Six holes are [[amidships]], three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=214}} Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=191}} Huge dents showed that many of the 14&nbsp;inch shells fired by ''King George V'' bounced off the German belt armour.{{sfn|Jackson|p=85}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin noted that the British battleships were shooting at very close range; the flat trajectory of the shells made it difficult to hit the relatively narrow target represented by the belt armour above the waterline, as shells that fell short would either ricochet up into the superstructure or explode on striking the water.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1994}}\n\nBallard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that \"''Bismarck'' did not implode.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=214\u2013215}} This suggests that ''Bismarck''{{'}}s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory.{{sfn|Jackson|p=88}} Ballard added \"we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact\". They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by her crew, as claimed by German survivors.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\nThe whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=177\u2013178}} The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank \"stern first\" and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 ''Prinz Eugen'' was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\n=== Subsequent expeditions ===\nIn June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built [[Submersible|mini-submarines]]. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, \"You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nAn Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano\u2014the only one in that area\u2014to locate the wreck. Using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader [[David Mearns]] claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: \"My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes\".{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nThe 2002 documentary ''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]] and filmed in May\u2013June 2002 using smaller and more agile [[Mir (submersible)|Mir submersibles]], reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that there was not enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nDespite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that ''Bismarck'' would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that ''Bismarck'' could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving  on the destroyer {{HMS|Tartar|F43|6}} at the time). Kennedy stated, \"That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}} When asked whether ''Bismarck'' would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied \"Sure. But it might have taken half a day.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} In Mearns' subsequent book ''Hood and Bismarck'', he conceded that scuttling \"may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} Ballard later concluded that \"As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Archaeological Oceanography''|p=111}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unsinkable Sam]] \u2013 cat which is said to have survived the sinking of ''Bismarck''\n\n== Footnotes

PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS FOR OR AGAINST A TOPIC IN THE INTRODUCTION, BUT ADD THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE SECTION BELOW.  -->\n\nThe '''Shroud of Turin''', also called the '''Turin Shroud''' ({{lang-it|Sindone di Torino}}, ''{{lang|it|Sacra Sindone}}'' {{IPA-it|\u02c8sa\u02d0kra \u02c8sindone|}} or ''{{lang|it|Santa Sindone}}''), is a length of [[linen]] cloth bearing the [[Negative (photography)|negative]] image of a man. Some claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion. The existence of the shroud was first securely attested in 1390 when a local bishop wrote that an unnamed artist had confessed that it was a forgery. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the fabric is consistent with this date of origin.\n\nThe artifact is kept in the [[Cathedral of Turin]], which is located next to a complex of buildings composed of the [[Royal Palace of Turin]], the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]] (located inside the Royal Palace and formerly connected to the Cathedral), and the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud \"a mirror of the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}</ref><ref>Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23\u201324 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]</ref> Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.<ref name=\"Dreisbach2001\"/> Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove, contrary to the scientific consensus, that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83\u2013150 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}</ref> Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.\n\nProponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].<ref>Charles S.

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right [[humerus]] may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307773215_Medical_News_From_Scientific_Analysis_of_the_Turin_Shroud Medical News From Scientific Analysis of the Turin Shroud]</ref> No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, Joe Nickell noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of starch fractions, various sugars, and other impurities. In a paper entitled \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation,\"<ref>Rogers, R.N. and Arnoldi, A.: \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction (Maillard reaction) may explain the image formation\", ''Melanoidins in Food and Health'', Volume 4, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp. 106\u2013113, {{ISBN|92-894-5724-4}}</ref> [[Raymond N. Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid decomposition products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

Some claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion. The existence of the shroud was first securely attested in 1390 when a local bishop wrote that an unnamed artist had confessed that it was a forgery. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the fabric is consistent with this date of origin.\n\nThe artifact is kept in the [[Cathedral of Turin]], which is located next to a complex of buildings composed of the [[Royal Palace of Turin]], the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]] (located inside the Royal Palace and formerly connected to the Cathedral), and the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud \"a mirror of the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}</ref><ref>Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23\u201324 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]</ref> Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.<ref name=\"Dreisbach2001\"/> Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove, contrary to the scientific consensus, that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern.

They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant [[Taxon|taxa]], including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human [[mtDNA]], sequences were found belonging to [[haplogroup]]s that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right [[humerus]] may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307773215_Medical_News_From_Scientific_Analysis_of_the_Turin_Shroud Medical News From Scientific Analysis of the Turin Shroud]</ref> No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body.

By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of [[starch]] fractions, various [[sugars]], and other impurities.

Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

As a teenager he was enthusiastic about rock and grunge music before digging deeper into jazz through his father's record collection. In 1993 Tuomarila was accepted to Oulunkyl\u00e4 pop/jazz Conservatory in [[Helsinki]], Finland, where he studied for a year. He continued his studies under [[Diederik Wissels]] and [[Nathalie Loriers]] at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] and earned his [[Master of Music]] degree in 1999.\n\nDuring his studies he formed his Quartet with [[Nicolas Kummert]], Christophe Devisscher, and Teun Verbruggen. In 1999 his quartet won the award for best band and Tuomarila won the prize for best soloist at the \"21st Hoeilaart International Jazz Competition\" Belgium. In 2001, he received the first prize at the \"3rd International Jazz Soloist Competition\" in [[Monaco]], and he won the \"10th International Tremplin Jazz Competition\" in [[Avignon]] with his quartet.\n\nThe Alexi Tuomarila Quartet also won the first prize at the \"5th International Granada Jazz Competition\" in Spain 2005.\n\nThe quartet recorded and released three albums \"Voices of Pohjola\" for [[Igloo Records]] (Benelux) 2001, the Emma Award (Finnish Grammy) nominee \"02\" for [[Finlandia Records]] - [[Warner Music Group]] 2003, and \"Runo X\" for Edita Cambeya (Spain) 2007.\n\nAlexi Tuomarila Quartet changed the name of the group into Drifter and welcomed Axel Gilain as a bass player/vocalist. Drifter recorded and released the critically acclaimed \"Flow\" album for [[Edition Records]], UK in 2015.\n\nIn 2005 Alexi Tuomarila formed his renowned trio, with Norwegian bassist [[Mats Eilertsen]] and Finnish drummer [[Olavi Louhivuori]]. The trio has released four critically acclaimed albums: \"Constellation\" for [[Jazzaway Records]] (Norway) 2006, and \"Seven Hills\" 2013, \"Kingdom\" 2017 and \"Sphere\" 2019 for distinguished British [[Edition Records]].\n\nThe latest album \"Sphere\" earned Tuomarila the prestigious [[Emma-gaala|Emma award]] (Finnish Grammy) for \"Jazz album of the year\".\n\nBritish [[BBC Music Magazine]] gave the album 5 stars and selected it as the \"Jazz album of the month\" (07/2019)\n\nAlexi Tuomarila played a decade, from 2007 until 2017, with the legendary Polish trumpet player [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]] in different kinds of band combinations. Their first concert together was at the 750th anniversary of the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]].

As a teenager he was enthusiastic about rock and grunge music before digging deeper into jazz through his father's record collection. In 1993 Tuomarila was accepted to Oulunkyl\u00e4 pop/jazz Conservatory in [[Helsinki]], Finland, where he studied for a year. He continued his studies under [[Diederik Wissels]] and [[Nathalie Loriers]] at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] and earned his [[Master of Music]] degree in 1999. \n\nDuring his studies he formed his Quartet with [[Nicolas Kummert]], Christophe Devisscher, and Teun Verbruggen. In 1999 his quartet won the award for best band and Tuomarila won the prize for best soloist at the \"21st Hoeilaart International Jazz Competition\" Belgium. In 2001, he received the first prize at the \"3rd International Jazz Soloist Competition\" in [[Monaco]], and he won the \"10th International Tremplin Jazz Competition\" in [[Avignon]] with his quartet. \n\nThe Alexi Tuomarila Quartet also won the first prize at the \"5th International Granada Jazz Competition\" in Spain 2005. \n\nThe quartet recorded and released three albums \"Voices of Pohjola\" for [[Igloo Records]] (Benelux) 2001, the Emma Award (Finnish Grammy) nominee \"02\" for [[Finlandia Records]] - [[Warner Music Group]] 2003, and \"Runo X\" for Edita Cambeya (Spain) 2007. \n\nAlexi Tuomarila Quartet changed the name of the group into Drifter and welcomed Axel Gilain as a bass player/vocalist. Drifter recorded and released the critically acclaimed \"Flow\" album for [[Edition Records]], UK in 2015.\n\nIn 2005 Alexi Tuomarila formed his renowned trio, with Norwegian bassist [[Mats Eilertsen]] and Finnish drummer [[Olavi Louhivuori]]. The trio has released four critically acclaimed albums: \"Constellation\" for [[Jazzaway Records]] (Norway) 2006, and \"Seven Hills\" 2013, \"Kingdom\" 2017 and \"Sphere\" 2019 for distinguished British [[Edition Records]]. \n\nThe latest album \"Sphere\" earned Tuomarila the prestigious [[Emma-gaala|Emma award]] (Finnish Grammy) for \"Jazz album of the year\". \n\nBritish [[BBC Music Magazine]] gave the album 5 stars and selected it as the \"Jazz album of the month\" (07/2019)\n\nAlexi Tuomarila played a decade, from 2007 until 2017, with the legendary Polish trumpet player [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]] in different kinds of band combinations.
