Lieutenants Kei Agemaki, Riken Yoshinokazura, and Ganryu Hanakiri are chosen to be the human representatives and are partnered with Zakuro, Susukihotaru, and Bonbori and Hozuki, respectively.

Despite this, she becomes smitten with Agemaki Kei shortly after the two are partnered.

When Agemaki expressed his fear of spirits as a child, his father yelled at him. In addition, shortly after seeing a spirit, he learned that his cat Itsue disappeared, leading Agemaki to believe that the spirit caused Itsue's disappearance. It is also alluded to that his mother and sister have some kind of spiritual power (or possibly being spirits themselves) since they can see spirits that humans do not and Kei's mother knew that Zakuro was a half-spirit even though she hid her ears.<!--- ep 7---> At the start of the series, he panics upon seeing full-blooded spirits, such as Amary\u014dju and Mamezo, and becomes so afraid, he asks Zakuro, who is easier to accept because of her more human appearance, to accompany him to the [[outhouse]].<ref name=\"Ep1\"/> Afterward, he makes an effort to understand Zakuro and other spirits, although this causes him to make the wrong conclusions, like offering the half-fox spirit Zakuro a candle to eat when he does not realize [[kitsune|fox spirits]] do not actually eat candles.

While using his real persona, he is seen wearing a yukata and a mask. He is manipulating the twins, Rangui, and the Ministry of Spirit Affairs for his own agenda, which involves Zakuro, whom he claims is perfect to \"bear his child\". For this reason he is obsessed with her to the point of harassing Byakuroku sexually after she was given some of Zakuro's powers, and eventually mistreats Rangui despite her crush on him.\n\n:It is later shown that lieutenant Hanadate is, in fact, Zakuro's older half brother. He is indirectly the reason Zakuro's father is dead, since when looking for his mother he witnessed Enaga (Zakuro's father) and Tsukuhane kissing and told his father which made his father furious. He would not even allow his mother to speak his name when she called to him. He kept telling her that she had no right to use his name, for she was a disgrace in his eyes, and his father's eyes.

Rangui thinks Daidai is just a dirty little half-spirit and a failure, but Rangui told Byakuroku that as long as she continues to serve her then Daidai will be treated the same way Byakuroku is.

However, some spirits have been causing trouble, and the Ministry of Spirit Affairs is established to maintain harmony. Lieutenants Kei Agemaki, Riken Yoshinokazura, and Ganryu Hanakiri are chosen to represent the humans. They are introduced to their female half-spirit partners: Zakuro, Susukihotaru, and twins Bonbori and Hozuki, respectively. While Susukihotaru, Bonbori, and Hozuki are delighted, Zakuro is disgusted with humans and their acceptance of [[Jesuit]] ideas. However, she becomes smitten with Agemaki. Shortly after, spirits Sakura and Kiri play around Agemaki, who immediately becomes nauseous and faints. In private, Yoshinokazura advises Agemaki against working with spirits as Agemaki's fear of spirits is severe. Agemaki believes that he has no alternative because of what his father might say. That night, Agemaki walks through the manor and is frightened by the spirits. He runs into Zakuro and hugs her. She interprets this as a romantic gesture. However, he asks her to accompany him to the [[outhouse]] because he is too scared to go alone. She becomes angry and wonders how she became smitten with a coward. In the morning, the representatives attend a [[Hanami|flower viewing]]. While they are walking, a crowd stares at the spirits and whispers behind their backs. Zakuro points out that they are used to this and tells Agemaki that he is no different from the crowd. Lightning strikes the ground, and the lightning beast [[Raiju]] appears. Because Raiju is well-behaved, the spirits are unconcerned. However, Raiju attacks. Agemaki rescues Sakura and Kiri, but is too frightened to run away. The girls fight and return Raiju to a calm state. As the representatives continue their party, the spirits wonder why Raiju lost control.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Crimson Brilliance\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Aka, K\u014dk\u014d to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u3042\u304b\u3001\u714c\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|10|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Zakuro has a dream that she is climbing a [[persimmon]] tree. When she picks the fruit, the tree is surrounded by spirits and she falls into a pool. Her mother's voice tells her that she should not climb persimmon trees because they are connected to the underworld. At breakfast, Agemaki offers Zakuro a candle to eat, believing that fox spirits eat candles, however, this enrages Zakuro and she leaves. Agemaki tells Kushimatsu that he was researching spirits because he wanted to understand Zakuro so he could help her as a partner. The representatives are sent to investigate a hotel construction site. However, construction has stopped because a spirit is scaring the workers. Although talking to the spirit is sufficient, the hotel's owner requests that the spirit be exterminated. Reluctantly, they begin searching for the spirit. However, Zakuro leaves Agemaki by himself. While looking for Zakuro, Agemaki runs into a large, shadow-like spirit. It attacks him, but stops short when it sees he is afraid. The other representatives arrive and pursue the spirit. Zakuro tells the spirit that she wants to talk. However, it does not cooperate. Zakuro slices the column, causing the hotel to collapse. Outside, Zakuro explains that the spirit's true, small form is revealed with light. Because of Westernization, the area is illuminated at night. In addition, the spirit's shrine was destroyed by the construction, so it tried to scare the humans away. She laments the loss of human respect for spirits. However, the hotel's owner is upset that the spirit was not exterminated and his hotel is ruined. To compromise, Lieutenant Hanadate offers to restore the shrine and have the hotel built on military land. He thanks a smitten Zakuro for reminding him to remember the important things.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Tragic Past\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Kako, Aiai to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u304b\u3053\u3001\u54c0\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Zakuro and Agemaki are left alone in the house while the others are out on investigations, and because of this Zakuro is bored and irritated. Before too long, a client comes to see Kushimatsu about a job that he wants done. Zakuro jumps at the chance of taking the case because it is about girls that have been spirited away. Though she is reluctant, Kushimatsu allows Zakuro and Agemaki to take the case of the client's village. Before they leave, Kushimatsu lets Agemaki know why Zakuro is so impatient about the case by telling him about how half-spirits are born and the connection to Zakuro. During the investigation, Zakuro begins to hear voices calling her and realizes that this is the same voice that lured the girl away from the village to be spirited away. That night, Zakuro and Agemaki are asked to sleep in the same room, and unlike Agemaki, Zakuro is surprised an embarrassed by the idea. When they finally settle down to sleep, Zakuro asks why Agemaki has been so cautious around her and Agemaki tells her about what Kushimatsu told him. Zakuro tells him about her mother and why she cannot let these kinds of cases go. As they sleep Agemaki is awakened by Zakuro leaving the room. He realizes that she is unconscious and is being led by the voice so he follows her. When she finally awakens, they are in front of a dark cave where a demon resides. They find out that the girls are not being spirited away, but being eaten by the demon. Zakuro defeats the demon and they both leave the cave by morning. Agemaki starts to feel guilty about having her always save him from the demons and Zakuro quietly disagrees with him.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Timid Distance\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Kyori, Kowagowa to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u304d\u3087\u308a\u3001\u6016\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|10|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yoshinokazura, Susukihotaru, Hanakiri, Bonbori and Hozuki investigate about a sword in Aya Orikata's possession.

When Orikata shows them the sword, Susukihotaru begins to breathe heavily and sweat. Afterwards, Hanakiri, Bonbori and Hozuki try to locate the customer and leave Yoshinokazura and Susukihotaru to take the sword home. The twins believe the sword was affecting Susukihotaru because she can [[empathy|empathize]] with objects and other people. At the shop, Mugi, a spirit working for Orikata, shows Susukihotaru a comb. Susukihotaru touches it and sees Mugi and her mother attacked by a swordsman. Susukihotaru learns Mugi does not remember this and tells Mugi that her mother will come if she is good. When Yoshinokazura asks Susukihotaru how she knew Mugi's mother, Susukihotaru admits that she was hiding something for fear of what he might say. Before she can elaborate, Mugi falls trying to take the sword off of a dresser. The sword falls into Susukihotaru's hands, and she sees the sword killing spirits. She draws the sword and attacks. As Orikata protects Mugi, Mugi remembers her mother dying. Yoshikazura catches the blade and cuts his hand, causing Susukihotaru to regain control. Later, Susukihotaru says she does not deserve the concern Yoshinokazura has for her. He realizes her ability to empathize, and tells her that because he does not say much, he appreciates her knowing what he is feeling. She cries and tells him that she hopes he knows what she is feeling. Hanakiri and the twins return unsuccessful, and the group leaves for home.

Hanadate immediately asks Zakuro to dance with him, telling her that it will be easier to watch the women while dancing. On the balcony, Agemaki tries to hide his jealousy while the twins attach magical petals to the women. They explain that they can sense the presence of anyone a petal is attached to when a twin is singing. When the dance is over, Zakuro is left by herself. She is approached by two soldiers who wish to touch her ears. Although she protests, they tell her that causing a scene will hurt the reputation of the Ministry of Spirit Affairs.

She climbs up the tree and grabs the kite, then suddenly hears her mother's voice, causing her to climb higher until she fell. She breaks the pendant her mother gave her, so Agemaki fixes it.

Once at the house, Zakuro asks Agemaki if he brought her to the house to investigate a spirit. Agemaki is surprised that a spirit still resides in the house. The pair are called down to dinner, where Zakuro learns that Agemaki's father wholeheartedly supports Westernization and is greatly prejudiced against spirits. She notices that Agemaki's sister is feeding a cat. He explains that when he was younger, a spirit frightened him. His father scolded him for being afraid. Later, Agemaki noticed that his cat, Itsue, was missing. Although he promised to apologize for whatever he did wrong or give up some other treasure, Itsue never returned. Zakuro tells Agemaki that Itsue has always been in the house. She asks Itsue to change form and appear to Agemaki. When Agemki can see Itsue, he finds that she was the spirit that frightened him. Zakuro explains that when a cat is loved, it becomes a [[Bakeneko|cat demon]]. Itsue simply wanted to thank Agemaki for being kind. She notes that most humans cannot see Itsue in her original form, but there seems to be an exception. The next morning, Agemaki's mother apologizes for her husband's discourtesy, hinting that she realizes Zakuro is a spirit.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Fickle Rain\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Ame, Adaada to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u3042\u3081\u3001\u5f92\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|11|23}}\n| ShortSummary        = While buying a present for Zakuro, Agemaki runs into Susukihotaru, who is returning Orikata's enchanted sword by herself because Yoshinokazura is cleaning shelves.

As Byakuroku searches for Daidai, she is shocked to discover that her sister has been fatally wounded by Rangui. As she dies, Daidai tells Byakuroku how much she envied her. Byakuroku attacks Rangui out of anguish, but her attacks are useless, because Rangui is more powerful than before. With Omodaka's help, the representatives battle Rangui. Rangui attacks Zakuro, but Agemaki shields her, and they are both trapped in Rangui's web with Zakuro still unconscious. Agemaki, refusing to give up since he has yet to tell her how he feels, hugs Zakuro and tells her he loves her. Zakuro wakes after she hears this, and releases her true power to destroy Rangui. As the village burns down, Omodaka goes to the room where Tsukahane's body is. He wishes to remain with his mother, and Byakuroku, having nowhere else to go, stays with him too. Zakuro, Agemaki and the others flee the village.\n\nBack at the manor, Kushimatsu tells the representatives that the Ministry of Spirit Affairs will be terminated. As everyone says their goodbyes, Agemaki tells Zakuro once again that he loves her, and Zakuro, reluctant at first, says that she loves him, too.

While using his real persona, he is seen wearing a yukata and a mask. He is manipulating the twins, Rangui, and the Ministry of Spirit Affairs for his own agenda, which involves Zakuro, whom he claims is perfect to \"bear his child\". For this reason he is obsessed with her to the point of harassing Byakuroku sexually after she was given some of Zakuro's powers, and eventually mistreats Rangui despite her crush on him.\n\n:It is later shown that lieutenant Hanadate is, in fact, Zakuro's older half brother. He is indirectly the reason Zakuro's father is dead, since when looking for his mother he witnessed Enaga (Zakuro's father) and Tsukuhane kissing and told his father which made his father furious. He would not even allow his mother to speak his name when she called to him. He kept telling her that she had no right to use his name, for she was a disgrace in his eyes, and his father's eyes. However, this was due to his want for his mother's attention, his jealousy of Enaga, and his lonely upbringing.\n\n;{{nihongo|Daidai|\u6a59\u6a59|}} and {{nihongo|Byakuroku|\u767e\u7dd1|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Minako Kotobuki]] (Daidai), [[Haruka Tomatsu]] (Byakuroku)}}\n:Daidai and Byakuroku are sisters who serve under Rangui.

They envy Zakuro for growing up in a happy home, having people to love and protect, and they envy her freedom.\n\n:Byakuroku and Daidai work as servants in the Village of the Oracles, where Byakuroku makes great efforts and overworks her body's resistance so she can protect her younger sister Daidai, who is more ignorant of the fact that they are being used and harbors some jealousy of what she thinks is favoritism of her older sister.\n\n;{{nihongo|Rangui|\u4e71\u676d|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Kikuko Inoue]]}}\n:Rangui is one of the main villains of the series who keeps targeting Zakuro. The sisters Daidai and Byakuroku serve her. Rangui thinks Daidai is just a dirty little half-spirit and a failure, but Rangui told Byakuroku that as long as she continues to serve her then Daidai will be treated the same way Byakuroku is. Rangui is able to use sorcery through paper, and is capable of transforming into a large and hideous spider-like monster. It is shown that Rangui has feelings for lieutenant Hanadate, but she soon learns that Hanadate is only using her to get what he wants. He wants Zakuro to bear his child, and when Rangui learns this she is furious and attacks Zakuro.\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Manga ===\nThe ''Otome Y\u014dkai Zakuro'' manga is written and illustrated by [[Lily Hoshino]].<ref name=\"JapVol1\">{{cite web|script-title=ja:\u304a\u3068\u3081\u5996\u602a\u3000\u3056\u304f\u308d (1) \u2044 \u661f\u91ce\u30ea\u30ea\u30a3 \u8457|trans-title=''Otome Y\u014dkai Zakuro'' (1) / Lily Hoshino|url=http://www.gentosha-comics.net/book/label/cat5/birzc/bc/601565.html|publisher=[[Gentosha]]|accessdate=September 22, 2015|language=Japanese}}</ref> It has been serialized in the ''[[seinen manga|seinen]]'' [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Comic Birz]]'' since the January 2007 issue released on November 30, 2006, with publication ongoing.<ref name=\"FirstSerial\">{{cite web|title=Monthly ''Comic Birz'' January 2007 Issue|url=http://www.gentosha.co.jp/search/book.php?ID=650138|publisher=[[Gentosha]]|accessdate=November 1, 2010|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ENpbS5ux?url=http://www.gentosha.co.jp/|archivedate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> The chapters have been collected by [[Gentosha]] in ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes.

However, some spirits have been causing trouble, and the Ministry of Spirit Affairs is established to maintain harmony. Lieutenants Kei Agemaki, Riken Yoshinokazura, and Ganryu Hanakiri are chosen to represent the humans. They are introduced to their female half-spirit partners: Zakuro, Susukihotaru, and twins Bonbori and Hozuki, respectively. While Susukihotaru, Bonbori, and Hozuki are delighted, Zakuro is disgusted with humans and their acceptance of [[Jesuit]] ideas. However, she becomes smitten with Agemaki. Shortly after, spirits Sakura and Kiri play around Agemaki, who immediately becomes nauseous and faints. In private, Yoshinokazura advises Agemaki against working with spirits as Agemaki's fear of spirits is severe. Agemaki believes that he has no alternative because of what his father might say. That night, Agemaki walks through the manor and is frightened by the spirits. He runs into Zakuro and hugs her. She interprets this as a romantic gesture. However, he asks her to accompany him to the [[outhouse]] because he is too scared to go alone. She becomes angry and wonders how she became smitten with a coward. In the morning, the representatives attend a [[Hanami|flower viewing]]. While they are walking, a crowd stares at the spirits and whispers behind their backs. Zakuro points out that they are used to this and tells Agemaki that he is no different from the crowd. Lightning strikes the ground, and the lightning beast [[Raiju]] appears. Because Raiju is well-behaved, the spirits are unconcerned. However, Raiju attacks. Agemaki rescues Sakura and Kiri, but is too frightened to run away. The girls fight and return Raiju to a calm state. As the representatives continue their party, the spirits wonder why Raiju lost control.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Crimson Brilliance\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Aka, K\u014dk\u014d to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u3042\u304b\u3001\u714c\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|10|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Zakuro has a dream that she is climbing a [[persimmon]] tree. When she picks the fruit, the tree is surrounded by spirits and she falls into a pool. Her mother's voice tells her that she should not climb persimmon trees because they are connected to the underworld. At breakfast, Agemaki offers Zakuro a candle to eat, believing that fox spirits eat candles, however, this enrages Zakuro and she leaves. Agemaki tells Kushimatsu that he was researching spirits because he wanted to understand Zakuro so he could help her as a partner. The representatives are sent to investigate a hotel construction site. However, construction has stopped because a spirit is scaring the workers. Although talking to the spirit is sufficient, the hotel's owner requests that the spirit be exterminated. Reluctantly, they begin searching for the spirit. However, Zakuro leaves Agemaki by himself. While looking for Zakuro, Agemaki runs into a large, shadow-like spirit. It attacks him, but stops short when it sees he is afraid. The other representatives arrive and pursue the spirit. Zakuro tells the spirit that she wants to talk. However, it does not cooperate. Zakuro slices the column, causing the hotel to collapse. Outside, Zakuro explains that the spirit's true, small form is revealed with light. Because of Westernization, the area is illuminated at night. In addition, the spirit's shrine was destroyed by the construction, so it tried to scare the humans away. She laments the loss of human respect for spirits. However, the hotel's owner is upset that the spirit was not exterminated and his hotel is ruined. To compromise, Lieutenant Hanadate offers to restore the shrine and have the hotel built on military land. He thanks a smitten Zakuro for reminding him to remember the important things.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Tragic Past\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Kako, Aiai to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u304b\u3053\u3001\u54c0\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Zakuro and Agemaki are left alone in the house while the others are out on investigations, and because of this Zakuro is bored and irritated. Before too long, a client comes to see Kushimatsu about a job that he wants done. Zakuro jumps at the chance of taking the case because it is about girls that have been spirited away. Though she is reluctant, Kushimatsu allows Zakuro and Agemaki to take the case of the client's village. Before they leave, Kushimatsu lets Agemaki know why Zakuro is so impatient about the case by telling him about how half-spirits are born and the connection to Zakuro. During the investigation, Zakuro begins to hear voices calling her and realizes that this is the same voice that lured the girl away from the village to be spirited away. That night, Zakuro and Agemaki are asked to sleep in the same room, and unlike Agemaki, Zakuro is surprised an embarrassed by the idea. When they finally settle down to sleep, Zakuro asks why Agemaki has been so cautious around her and Agemaki tells her about what Kushimatsu told him. Zakuro tells him about her mother and why she cannot let these kinds of cases go. As they sleep Agemaki is awakened by Zakuro leaving the room.

Orikata explains that a customer obtained it through \"a secret channel\" and later noticed everyone around her met with unfortunate events. She gave the sword to Orikata, who refuses to sell it. When Orikata shows them the sword, Susukihotaru begins to breathe heavily and sweat. Afterwards, Hanakiri, Bonbori and Hozuki try to locate the customer and leave Yoshinokazura and Susukihotaru to take the sword home. The twins believe the sword was affecting Susukihotaru because she can [[empathy|empathize]] with objects and other people. At the shop, Mugi, a spirit working for Orikata, shows Susukihotaru a comb. Susukihotaru touches it and sees Mugi and her mother attacked by a swordsman. Susukihotaru learns Mugi does not remember this and tells Mugi that her mother will come if she is good. When Yoshinokazura asks Susukihotaru how she knew Mugi's mother, Susukihotaru admits that she was hiding something for fear of what he might say. Before she can elaborate, Mugi falls trying to take the sword off of a dresser. The sword falls into Susukihotaru's hands, and she sees the sword killing spirits. She draws the sword and attacks. As Orikata protects Mugi, Mugi remembers her mother dying. Yoshikazura catches the blade and cuts his hand, causing Susukihotaru to regain control. Later, Susukihotaru says she does not deserve the concern Yoshinokazura has for her. He realizes her ability to empathize, and tells her that because he does not say much, he appreciates her knowing what he is feeling. She cries and tells him that she hopes he knows what she is feeling. Hanakiri and the twins return unsuccessful, and the group leaves for home. That night, Kushimatsu and Amaryoju wonder if the incident was a coincidence or orchestrated.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| NumParts            = 1\n| Title_1             = Sticky Trap\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Wana, Nebaneba to\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u308f\u306a\u3001\u7c98\u3005\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|11|2}}\n| ShortSummary        = Soldiers have been lured away by a beautiful woman who transforms into a spider and kills them, earning her the nickname the Black Widow.

Hanadate immediately asks Zakuro to dance with him, telling her that it will be easier to watch the women while dancing. On the balcony, Agemaki tries to hide his jealousy while the twins attach magical petals to the women. They explain that they can sense the presence of anyone a petal is attached to when a twin is singing. When the dance is over, Zakuro is left by herself. She is approached by two soldiers who wish to touch her ears. Although she protests, they tell her that causing a scene will hurt the reputation of the Ministry of Spirit Affairs. Before the soldiers can touch her ears, Agemaki intervenes. As Zakuro cries, Agemaki tries to comfort her. The twins notice that Hanadate is leaving the ballroom with a mysterious woman. Shortly after, a petal has been destroyed. Hanakiri and the twins track the destroyed petal and discover Hanadate is trapped in a giant web. The other representatives are confronted by a pair of cloaked figures, but the figures are quickly overpowered. The Black Widow attacks Hanakiri and the twins with her spider form. Hozuki protects Hanakiri while Bonbori fights. However, the twins are only at half of their power when separated, and Bonbori is easily defeated. Before the Black Widow kills her, Zakuro arrives and stabs the Black Widow, who reverts to her human form. The Black Widow tells Zakuro that everything will be explained soon and reveals that she knows Zakuro's mother.

Zakuro asks why he did not climb the tree, and he tells her that he is afraid of heights. She climbs up the tree and grabs the kite, then suddenly hears her mother's voice, causing her to climb higher until she fell. She breaks the pendant her mother gave her, so Agemaki fixes it.

The pair are called down to dinner, where Zakuro learns that Agemaki's father wholeheartedly supports Westernization and is greatly prejudiced against spirits. She notices that Agemaki's sister is feeding a cat. He explains that when he was younger, a spirit frightened him. His father scolded him for being afraid. Later, Agemaki noticed that his cat, Itsue, was missing. Although he promised to apologize for whatever he did wrong or give up some other treasure, Itsue never returned. Zakuro tells Agemaki that Itsue has always been in the house. She asks Itsue to change form and appear to Agemaki. When Agemki can see Itsue, he finds that she was the spirit that frightened him. Zakuro explains that when a cat is loved, it becomes a [[Bakeneko|cat demon]]. Itsue simply wanted to thank Agemaki for being kind.

Although it has not harmed anyone, he wishes to prevent future damage. So, the group decides to play the game. When they begin, a spirit-like being appears. However, it is just a visualization of the feelings of humans who mistook it for the kokkuri's appearance. The maids and the twins immediately ask it questions about Agemaki's romantic interests.

Byakuroku attacks Rangui out of anguish, but her attacks are useless, because Rangui is more powerful than before. With Omodaka's help, the representatives battle Rangui. Rangui attacks Zakuro, but Agemaki shields her, and they are both trapped in Rangui's web with Zakuro still unconscious. Agemaki, refusing to give up since he has yet to tell her how he feels, hugs Zakuro and tells her he loves her. Zakuro wakes after she hears this, and releases her true power to destroy Rangui.

Since 1846, when the [[Quirinal Palace]] was used, the [[Sistine Chapel]] in the Vatican has served as the location of the election.

However, there is inevitably always much speculation about which cardinals have serious prospects of being elected. Speculation tends to mount when a pope is ill or aged and shortlists of potential candidates appear in the media. A cardinal who is considered to be a prospect for the papacy is described informally as a ''[[papabile]]'' (an adjective used substantively: the plural form is ''papabili''), a term coined by Italian-speaking Vatican watchers in the mid-twentieth century, literally meaning \"pope-able\".\n\n=== Death of the pope ===\n[[File:Cardinal Camerlengo certifying a papal death.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Cardinal Camerlengo proclaims a papal death]]\n\nThe death of the pope is verified by the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]], or Chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out his Christian (not papal) name three times in the presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, and of the Cleric Prelates, Secretary and Chancellor of the [[Apostolic Camera]]. The Cardinal Camerlengo takes possession of the [[Ring of the Fisherman]] worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals.

If a ballot takes place on the afternoon of the first day and no-one is elected, or no ballot had taken place, a maximum of four ballots are held on each successive day: two in each morning and two in each afternoon. Before voting in the morning and again before voting in the afternoon, the electors take an oath to obey the rules of the conclave. If no result is obtained after three vote days of balloting, the process is suspended for a maximum of one day for prayer and an address by the senior Cardinal Deacon. After seven further ballots, the process may again be similarly suspended, with the address now being delivered by the senior Cardinal Priest. If, after another seven ballots, no result is achieved, voting is suspended once more, the address being delivered by the senior Cardinal Bishop. After a further seven ballots, there shall be a day of prayer, reflection and dialogue. In the following ballots, only the two names who received the most votes in the last ballot shall be eligible in a [[runoff election]] where a two-third majority is still required. However, the two people who are being voted on, if Cardinal electors, shall not themselves have the right to vote.<ref name=\"BXVI-MP\" />\n\nThe process of voting comprises three phases: the \"pre-scrutiny\", the \"scrutiny\", and the \"post-scrutiny.\"\n\n==== Pre-scrutiny ====\nDuring the pre-scrutiny, the Masters of the Ceremonies prepare ballot papers bearing the words ''Eligo in Summum Pontificem'' (\"I elect as Supreme Pontiff\") and provide at least two to each cardinal elector. As the cardinals begin to write down their votes, the Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of Ceremonies exit; the junior Cardinal Deacon then closes the door. The junior Cardinal Deacon then draws by lot nine names; the first three become Scrutineers, the second three ''Infirmarii'' and the last three Revisers. New Scrutineers, ''Infirmarii'' and Revisers are not selected again after the first scrutiny; the same nine cardinals perform the same task for the second scrutiny. After lunch, the election resumes with the oath to obey the rules of the conclave taken anew when the cardinals again assemble in the Sistine Chapel. Nine names are chosen for new scrutineers, infirmarii, and revisers. The third scrutiny then commences, and if necessary, a fourth immediately follows.<ref>''Universi Dominici gregis'' (Shepherd of the Lord's Whole Flock), promulgated by Pope John Paul II, 22 February 1996</ref>  No changes in these rules were made by Benedict XVI in 2007.  These rules were followed (so far as is known, given the secrecy of a conclave) in electing Pope Francis in March 2013.\n\n==== Scrutiny ====\nThe scrutiny phase of the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only the name of the individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes the following Latin oath:\n\n{{Quote|''Testor Christum Dominum, qui me iudicaturus est, me eum eligere, quem secundum Deum iudico eligi debere.''\n\nI call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge that my vote is given to the one who, before God, I think should be elected.}}\n\nIf any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the ''Infirmarii'' go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals complete the ballot papers and then take the oath and drop the ballot papers into the box. When the ''Infirmarii'' return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.\n\nThe oath when casting one's vote is therefore anonymous, since the name of the elector is no longer signed on the ballot with that of the candidate. (Previously, the ballot was signed by the elector, who included his motif [unique identification code].  Then he folded it over at two places to cover his signature and motiff. After this, it was sealed with wax to result in a semi-secret ballot. See example above.) This was the procedure prior to 1945. The example above is a copy of the old three section semi-secret ballot, which was last used in the conclave of 1939. There was no oath taken when actually casting ballots, prior to 1621.<ref>Ludwig Von Pastor, History of the Papacy, the Bulls of Gregory XV, Aeterni Patris, and Decet Romanum Pontificem 1621\u20131622</ref> Completely secret ballots (at the option of the cardinals present and voting) were sometimes used prior to 1621, but these secret ballots had no oath taken when the vote was actually cast. At some conclaves prior to 1621, the cardinals verbally voted and sometimes stood in groups to facilitate counting the votes cast. The signature and motif of the elector covered by two folded-over parts of the ballot paper was added by Gregory XV in 1621, to prevent anyone from casting the deciding vote for himself. [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]] of England refused to cast the deciding vote for himself in 1549 (and was not elected), but in 1492 Cardinal Borgia ([[Pope Alexander VI]]) did cast the deciding vote for himself.<ref>Francis Burkle Young, Conclaves in the 15th century; also see Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, a website maintained by Salvador Miranda, via FIU</ref> Faced by the mortal challenge to the papacy emanating from Protestantism, and fearing schism due to several stormy conclaves in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Gregory XV established this procedure to prevent any cardinal from casting the deciding vote for himself.<ref>Ludwig Von Pastor, History of the Papacy,</ref> Since 1945, a cardinal can again cast the deciding vote for himself, though the \u2154 majority rule has always been continued, except when John Paul II had modified that rule in 1996 (after 33 ballots, a simple majority was sufficient), with the \u2154 majority rule restored in 2007 by Benedict XVI.<ref name=\"Bxvi-al\">Benedict XVI (11 June 2007) [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070611_de-electione_lt.html \" De aliquibus mutationibus in normis de electione Romani Pontificis\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222062902/http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070611_de-electione.html |date=22 December 2017 }} Apostolic letter.</ref>\n\nPrior to 1621, the only oath taken was that of obedience to the rules of the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting \"courtesy votes\" and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step voting procedure, since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945.<ref>Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis, 8 December 1945, Pope Pius XII</ref><ref>Vacante Sede Apostolica, 25 December 1904 Pope Pius X</ref>\n\nOnce all votes have been cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, and the last Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not correspond to the number of cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated.

Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the [[1939 papal conclave|1939 conclave]] there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the [[1958 papal conclave|1958 conclave]], caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The [[Siri thesis]] was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.\n\nSince 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process,  and beginning in 2005, bells ring after a successful election to augment the white smoke.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/pope/choosing/html/rituals.stm 3 \u2013 Voting rituals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409203846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/pope/choosing/html/rituals.stm |date=9 April 2006 }}, from the BBC series \"Choosing a Pope\"</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013 conclave, the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke:<ref name=\"Conclave Smoke Recipe\">{{cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Conclave Smoke's Recipe Is a Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/europe/recipe-for-conclaves-black-and-white-smoke-remains-mystery.html?ref=europe|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Vatican Reveals Recipe\">{{cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Vatican Reveals Recipes for Conclave Smoke|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/science/vatican-reveals-recipes-for-conclave-smoke.html?ref=europe|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=Chemicals-for-Fumata>{{cite news|title=As\u00ed se consigue la fumata blanca y la negra|url=http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130313/abci-componentes-quimicos-fumata-201303131427.html|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=ABC|date=13 March 2013|agency=Agencia EFE|location=Vatican City|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n* Black smoke: [[potassium perchlorate]], [[anthracene]], [[sulfur]]\n* White smoke: [[potassium chlorate]], [[lactose]], [[rosin|pine rosin]]\n\n=== Acceptance and proclamation ===\nOnce the election concludes, the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall. The Cardinal Dean then asks the pope-elect if he assents to the election, saying in Latin: \"''Acceptasne electionem de te canonice factam in Summum Pontificem?'' (Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?)\" There is no requirement that the pope-elect do so and he is free to respond \"''Non accepto''\" (I do not accept).\n\nIn practice, any cardinal who intends not to accept will explicitly state this ''before'' he receives a sufficient number of votes to become pope, as [[Giovanni Colombo]] did in [[October 1978 papal conclave|October 1978]].<ref>Thomas J. Resse SJ, ''Inside The Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church'', Harvard University Press (1996), p. 99.</ref><ref>Menachery George, Vatican Adventure http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/menachery/html/GeorgeMenachery.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214041643/http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/menachery/html/GeorgeMenachery.htm |date=14 December 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIf he accepts, and is already a [[bishop]], he immediately takes office. If he is not a bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest (not a bishop) is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself\u2014Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger\u2014was elected pope, thus impeding him from the stated Dean's duties. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal [[Giovanni Battista Re]].\n\nSince 533,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} the new pope has also decided on his regnal name. [[Pope John II]] was the first to adopt a new [[papal name]]; he felt that his original name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a [[Mercury (mythology)|Roman god]]. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: \"''Quo nomine vis vocari?'' (By what name do you wish to be called?)\"  After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.\n\nIn the past, when the cardinals were voting during the conclave, they sat on canopied thrones symbolizing the cardinals' collective governance of the church during the period of ''sede vacante''.<ref name=wintle/> Upon the acceptance by the new pope of his election, all other cardinals in attendance would each pull a cord and lower the canopies above their respective thrones signifying an end to the period of collective governance and only the newly elected pope's canopy remained unlowered.<ref name=wintle />  The last time canopied thrones were used was during the [[papal conclave, 1963|1963 conclave]].<ref name=\"PapalConclave1963\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-orhFzr2xeY Conclave A.D. 1963 \u2013 Election of Pope Paul VI] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409044709/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-orhFzr2xeY |date=9 April 2016 }}. YouTube video. Accessed 19 October 2013</ref> Beginning with the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|1978 August conclave]] canopied thrones were no longer used due to the lack of space resulting from the large increase in the number of cardinal electors (two rows of seats needed).\n\nAt the end of the conclave, the new pope if he so chose, would give his cardinalitial zucchetto or skull cap to the secretary of the conclave, indicating the secretary would be made cardinal at the next consistory to create cardinals. Prior to the 2013 conclave, this tradition was last followed at the 1958 conclave by the newly elected [[Pope John XXIII]], who bestowed his cardinal's skull cap on [[Alberto di Jorio]] and created him a cardinal at the consistory on 15 December of that year. In 2013 the Portuguese section of Vatican Radio reported that at the conclusion of the 2013 conclave, the newly elected Pope Francis bestowed his cardinalitial [[zucchetto]] on Archbishop [[Lorenzo Baldisseri]], the secretary of that conclave,<ref name=\"Baldisseri news\">{{cite web|url=http://pt.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/16/dom_lorenzo_baldisseri_recebe_solideu_cardinal%C3%ADcio/bra-673713|title=Dom Lorenzo Baldisseri recebe solideu cardinal\u00edcio|publisher=R\u00e1dio Vaticano Portuguese section|language=Portuguese}}</ref> and on 22 February 2014 at Pope Francis' first consistory, Baldisseri was formally made a cardinal with the title of Cardinal-Deacon of Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/166955 | title=Annuncio di Concistoro per la Creazione di Nuovi Cardinali | publisher=[[The Vatican Today]] | date=12 January 2014 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nThen, the new pope goes to the '''Room of Tears''', a small red room next to the Sistine Chapel; the room has the nickname because of the strong emotions experienced by the new pope. The new pope dresses by himself, choosing a set of pontifical robes\u2014consisting of a white [[cassock]], [[rochet]], and red [[mozzetta]]\u2014from three sizes provided. He then wears a gold corded [[pectoral cross]], a red and gold embroidered [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], and then dons the white papal [[zucchetto]] on his head. In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] dispensed with the red mozzetta, rochet, and gold pectoral cross, wearing only the white cassock and his own pectoral cross when he appeared on the central balcony. He also did not emerge wearing the stole, vesting in it only to impart the [[Apostolic Blessing]] and removing it shortly after.\n\nNext, the [[Cardinal Protodeacon]] (the senior Cardinal Deacon) appears at the [[loggia]] of the Basilica to proclaim the new pope. He usually proceeds with the traditional Latin formula (assuming the new Pope was a cardinal):\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:''<br />\n''[[Habemus Papam]]!''<br />\n''Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,''<br />\n''Dominum [forename],''<br />\n''Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem [surname],''<br />\n''qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].''\n{{col-2}}\n''(\"I announce to you a great joy:''<br />\n''We have a Pope!''<br />\n''The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,''<br />\n''Lord [forename],''<br />\n''Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],''<br />\n''who takes to himself the name [papal name].\")''\n{{col-end}}\n\nDuring the announcement for Pope Benedict XVI's election, the cardinal protodeacon, [[Jorge Medina|Jorge Arturo Medina Est\u00e9vez]], greeted the crowds first in several different languages \"Dear brothers and sisters\" before proceeding to the Latin announcement. This was not done when Pope Francis was elected.\n\nIt has happened in the past that the Cardinal Protodeacon has himself been the person elected pope. In such an event, the announcement is made by the next senior Deacon, who has thus succeeded as Protodeacon. The last time the cardinal protodeacon was elected was in 1513 when Giovanni de Medici was elected as [[Pope Leo X]] and the next senior cardinal deacon [[Pope Paul III|Alessandro Farnese]] (the future Pope Paul III) made the announcement.  After the election of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1878, Protodeacon [[Prospero Caterini]] appeared and started to make the announcement but was [[Stage fright|physically incapable of completing it]], so another made it for him.{{efn|Richard Henry Clarke's book about Leo XIII claims that Prospero Caterini made the announcement<ref name=\"Clarke 1878\">{{cite book|title=The life of His Holiness Pope Leo XIII ...: together with extracts from his pastorals and encyclicals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCEMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=papal+elections+%26+Caterini&source=bl&ots=QaXmPJ5Cil&sig=Afavl-zjcOwAPSvXKX7ncgwZT3A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0Mn1UpSlIJDgoAT294CwAg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=papal%20elections%20%26%20Caterini&f=false|author=Richard Henry Clarke}}</ref> and Salvador Miranda's entry on Cardinal Caterini at ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'' website mentions Caterini as having given the announcement<ref name=Caterini>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853.htm#Caterini|work=Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|title=Caterini, Prospero}}</ref> but Francis Burkle-Young claims that Caterini started to make the announcement but was incapable of completing the spoken formula and was ultimately assisted by Bartolomeo Grassi-Landi, a non-cardinal and the conclavist of Cardinal [[Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano]]<ref name=\"Burkle-Young 1878\">{{cite book|title=Papal Elections in the Age of Transition, 1878\u20131922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QxJMdp6FMC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=papal+elections+%26+Caterini&source=bl&ots=4D7lib1pGF&sig=xegvsLW9zC69EWEjcUeeNhhu07k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0Mn1UpSlIJDgoAT294CwAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=papal%20elections%20%26%20Caterini&f=false|author=Francis A.

''[[BBC News]]''. 26 June 2007.</ref>\n\n== Historical development ==\n{{Main|Papal selection before 1059}}\nThe procedures for the election of the pope developed over almost two [[millennium|millennia]]. Until the college of cardinals was created in 1059, the Bishops of Rome, like those in other areas, were elected by acclamation of the local clergy and people. Procedures similar to the present system were introduced in 1274 when [[Pope Gregory X|Gregory X]] promulgated ''[[Ubi periculum]]'' following the action of the magistrates of [[Viterbo]] during the interregnum of 1268\u20131271.<ref name=\"CE-Conclave\">{{CathEncy | author= Dowling, A. | wstitle= Conclave}}</ref>\n\nThe process was further refined by [[Gregory XV]] with his 1621 bull ''[[Aeterni Patris Filius]]'', which established the requirement of a two-thirds majority of cardinal electors to elect a pope.<ref>Signorotto and Visceglia 2002, p. 106</ref> The [[Third Lateran Council]] had initially set the requirement that two-thirds of the cardinals were needed to elect a pope in 1179.<ref name=Baumgartner3233>Baumgartner 2003, pp. 32-33</ref> This requirement has varied since then, depending on whether the winning candidate was allowed to vote for himself, in which cases the required majority was two-thirds plus one vote. ''Aeterni Patris Filius'' prohibited this practice and established two-thirds as the standard needed for election.<ref name=Baumgartner146>Baumgartner 2003, p. 146</ref> ''Aeterni Patris Filius'' did not eliminate the possibility of [[election by acclamation]], but did require that a secret ballot take place first before a pope could be elected.<ref>Baumgartner 2003, p. 145</ref>\n\n=== Electorate ===\nAs [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] communities emerged, they elected bishops, chosen by the clergy and [[laity]] with the assistance of the bishops of neighbouring dioceses.<ref name=\"Baumgartner4\" /> [[St. Cyprian]] (died 258) says that [[Pope Cornelius]] (in office 251\u2013253) was chosen as Bishop of Rome \"by the decree of God and of His Church, by the testimony of nearly all the clergy, by the college of aged bishops [''sacerdotum''], and of good men\".<ref name=\"CE-Election\">{{CathEncy | author= Joyce, G. H. | wstitle= Election of the Popes}}</ref> As in other dioceses, the clergy of the Diocese of Rome was the electoral body for the Bishop of Rome. Instead of casting votes, the bishop was selected by general [[consensus]] or by [[acclamation]]. The candidate would then be submitted to the people for their general approval or disapproval. This lack of precision in the election procedures occasionally gave rise to rival popes or [[antipope]]s.<ref name=\"CE-Papal\">{{CathEncy | author= Fanning, W. H. W. | wstitle= Papal Elections}}</ref>\n\nThe right of the laity to reject the person elected was abolished by a [[Lateran Council (769)|Synod held in the Lateran]] in 769, but restored to [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Roman noblemen]] by [[Pope Nicholas I]] during a Synod of Rome in 862.<ref name=\"CE-Papal\" /> The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], who had the duty of providing security and public peace in Rome.<ref>Baumgartner 2003, p. 14\u201319.</ref> A major change came in 1059, when [[Pope Nicholas II]] decreed in ''[[In Nomine Domini]]'' that the cardinals were to elect a candidate, who would take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity.

However, the two people who are being voted on, if Cardinal electors, shall not themselves have the right to vote.<ref name=\"BXVI-MP\" />\n\nThe process of voting comprises three phases: the \"pre-scrutiny\", the \"scrutiny\", and the \"post-scrutiny.\"\n\n==== Pre-scrutiny ====\nDuring the pre-scrutiny, the Masters of the Ceremonies prepare ballot papers bearing the words ''Eligo in Summum Pontificem'' (\"I elect as Supreme Pontiff\") and provide at least two to each cardinal elector. As the cardinals begin to write down their votes, the Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of Ceremonies exit; the junior Cardinal Deacon then closes the door. The junior Cardinal Deacon then draws by lot nine names; the first three become Scrutineers, the second three ''Infirmarii'' and the last three Revisers. New Scrutineers, ''Infirmarii'' and Revisers are not selected again after the first scrutiny; the same nine cardinals perform the same task for the second scrutiny. After lunch, the election resumes with the oath to obey the rules of the conclave taken anew when the cardinals again assemble in the Sistine Chapel. Nine names are chosen for new scrutineers, infirmarii, and revisers. The third scrutiny then commences, and if necessary, a fourth immediately follows.<ref>''Universi Dominici gregis'' (Shepherd of the Lord's Whole Flock), promulgated by Pope John Paul II, 22 February 1996</ref>  No changes in these rules were made by Benedict XVI in 2007.  These rules were followed (so far as is known, given the secrecy of a conclave) in electing Pope Francis in March 2013.\n\n==== Scrutiny ====\nThe scrutiny phase of the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only the name of the individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes the following Latin oath:\n\n{{Quote|''Testor Christum Dominum, qui me iudicaturus est, me eum eligere, quem secundum Deum iudico eligi debere.''\n\nI call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge that my vote is given to the one who, before God, I think should be elected.}}\n\nIf any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the ''Infirmarii'' go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals complete the ballot papers and then take the oath and drop the ballot papers into the box. When the ''Infirmarii'' return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.\n\nThe oath when casting one's vote is therefore anonymous, since the name of the elector is no longer signed on the ballot with that of the candidate. (Previously, the ballot was signed by the elector, who included his motif [unique identification code].  Then he folded it over at two places to cover his signature and motiff. After this, it was sealed with wax to result in a semi-secret ballot. See example above.) This was the procedure prior to 1945. The example above is a copy of the old three section semi-secret ballot, which was last used in the conclave of 1939. There was no oath taken when actually casting ballots, prior to 1621.<ref>Ludwig Von Pastor, History of the Papacy, the Bulls of Gregory XV, Aeterni Patris, and Decet Romanum Pontificem 1621\u20131622</ref> Completely secret ballots (at the option of the cardinals present and voting) were sometimes used prior to 1621, but these secret ballots had no oath taken when the vote was actually cast. At some conclaves prior to 1621, the cardinals verbally voted and sometimes stood in groups to facilitate counting the votes cast. The signature and motif of the elector covered by two folded-over parts of the ballot paper was added by Gregory XV in 1621, to prevent anyone from casting the deciding vote for himself. [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]] of England refused to cast the deciding vote for himself in 1549 (and was not elected), but in 1492 Cardinal Borgia ([[Pope Alexander VI]]) did cast the deciding vote for himself.<ref>Francis Burkle Young, Conclaves in the 15th century; also see Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, a website maintained by Salvador Miranda, via FIU</ref> Faced by the mortal challenge to the papacy emanating from Protestantism, and fearing schism due to several stormy conclaves in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Gregory XV established this procedure to prevent any cardinal from casting the deciding vote for himself.<ref>Ludwig Von Pastor, History of the Papacy,</ref> Since 1945, a cardinal can again cast the deciding vote for himself, though the \u2154 majority rule has always been continued, except when John Paul II had modified that rule in 1996 (after 33 ballots, a simple majority was sufficient), with the \u2154 majority rule restored in 2007 by Benedict XVI.<ref name=\"Bxvi-al\">Benedict XVI (11 June 2007) [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070611_de-electione_lt.html \" De aliquibus mutationibus in normis de electione Romani Pontificis\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222062902/http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070611_de-electione.html |date=22 December 2017 }} Apostolic letter.</ref>\n\nPrior to 1621, the only oath taken was that of obedience to the rules of the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting \"courtesy votes\" and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step voting procedure, since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945.<ref>Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis, 8 December 1945, Pope Pius XII</ref><ref>Vacante Sede Apostolica, 25 December 1904 Pope Pius X</ref>\n\nOnce all votes have been cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, and the last Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not correspond to the number of cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.\n\nOnce all of the ballots have been opened, the final post-scrutiny phase begins.\n\n==== Post-scrutiny ====\n[[File:Fumo negro.jpg|thumb|right|''Fumata nera'' in the [[Sistine Chapel]], indicating that there was not a two-thirds majority in the [[papal election]] at the Conclave.<ref name=Fumata-SmokeSignal>{{cite news|last=Chumley|first=Cheryl K.|title=What Do American Catholics Want in the Next Pope?|url=http://nation.foxnews.com/catholic-church/2013/03/12/what-do-american-catholics-want-next-pope|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Fox News|date=12 March 2013|agency=The Washington Times|location= }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Fumo branco.jpg|thumb|right|''Fumata bianca'' in Sistine Chapel, indicating that a pope has been elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref name=Fumata-SmokeSignal />]]\nThe Scrutineers add up all of the votes, and the Revisers check the ballots and the names on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made. The ballots are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the assistance of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.\n\n==== The fumata (smoke) ====\nBeginning in the early 1800s, the ballots used by cardinals were burned after each ballot to indicate a failed election.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Pio|first=Oscar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai3zNKl22CkC&pg=PA232&dq=storia+fumata+conclave&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWpLTNoNrnAhXVJzQIHfHmD28Q6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=storia%20fumata%20conclave&f=false%7Caccesso=2020-02-18%7Cdata=1876%7Ceditore|title=Storia popolare d'Italia dall'origine fino all'acquisto di Roma nell'anno 1870 compilata da Oscar Pio sulle tracce di Guicciardini, Botta, Balbo, Sismondi, Coletta, Cant\u00f9, La Farina, Varchi ecc|date=1876|publisher=G.

Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the [[1939 papal conclave|1939 conclave]] there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the [[1958 papal conclave|1958 conclave]], caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The [[Siri thesis]] was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.\n\nSince 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process,  and beginning in 2005, bells ring after a successful election to augment the white smoke.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/pope/choosing/html/rituals.stm 3 \u2013 Voting rituals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409203846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/pope/choosing/html/rituals.stm |date=9 April 2006 }}, from the BBC series \"Choosing a Pope\"</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013 conclave, the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke:<ref name=\"Conclave Smoke Recipe\">{{cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Conclave Smoke's Recipe Is a Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/europe/recipe-for-conclaves-black-and-white-smoke-remains-mystery.html?ref=europe|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Vatican Reveals Recipe\">{{cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Vatican Reveals Recipes for Conclave Smoke|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/science/vatican-reveals-recipes-for-conclave-smoke.html?ref=europe|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=Chemicals-for-Fumata>{{cite news|title=As\u00ed se consigue la fumata blanca y la negra|url=http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130313/abci-componentes-quimicos-fumata-201303131427.html|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=ABC|date=13 March 2013|agency=Agencia EFE|location=Vatican City|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n* Black smoke: [[potassium perchlorate]], [[anthracene]], [[sulfur]]\n* White smoke: [[potassium chlorate]], [[lactose]], [[rosin|pine rosin]]\n\n=== Acceptance and proclamation ===\nOnce the election concludes, the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall. The Cardinal Dean then asks the pope-elect if he assents to the election, saying in Latin: \"''Acceptasne electionem de te canonice factam in Summum Pontificem?'' (Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?)\" There is no requirement that the pope-elect do so and he is free to respond \"''Non accepto''\" (I do not accept).\n\nIn practice, any cardinal who intends not to accept will explicitly state this ''before'' he receives a sufficient number of votes to become pope, as [[Giovanni Colombo]] did in [[October 1978 papal conclave|October 1978]].<ref>Thomas J. Resse SJ, ''Inside The Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church'', Harvard University Press (1996), p. 99.</ref><ref>Menachery George, Vatican Adventure http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/menachery/html/GeorgeMenachery.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214041643/http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/menachery/html/GeorgeMenachery.htm |date=14 December 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIf he accepts, and is already a [[bishop]], he immediately takes office. If he is not a bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest (not a bishop) is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself\u2014Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger\u2014was elected pope, thus impeding him from the stated Dean's duties. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal [[Giovanni Battista Re]].\n\nSince 533,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} the new pope has also decided on his regnal name. [[Pope John II]] was the first to adopt a new [[papal name]]; he felt that his original name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a [[Mercury (mythology)|Roman god]]. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: \"''Quo nomine vis vocari?'' (By what name do you wish to be called?)\"  After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.\n\nIn the past, when the cardinals were voting during the conclave, they sat on canopied thrones symbolizing the cardinals' collective governance of the church during the period of ''sede vacante''.<ref name=wintle/> Upon the acceptance by the new pope of his election, all other cardinals in attendance would each pull a cord and lower the canopies above their respective thrones signifying an end to the period of collective governance and only the newly elected pope's canopy remained unlowered.<ref name=wintle />  The last time canopied thrones were used was during the [[papal conclave, 1963|1963 conclave]].<ref name=\"PapalConclave1963\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-orhFzr2xeY Conclave A.D. 1963 \u2013 Election of Pope Paul VI] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409044709/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-orhFzr2xeY |date=9 April 2016 }}. YouTube video. Accessed 19 October 2013</ref> Beginning with the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|1978 August conclave]] canopied thrones were no longer used due to the lack of space resulting from the large increase in the number of cardinal electors (two rows of seats needed).\n\nAt the end of the conclave, the new pope if he so chose, would give his cardinalitial zucchetto or skull cap to the secretary of the conclave, indicating the secretary would be made cardinal at the next consistory to create cardinals. Prior to the 2013 conclave, this tradition was last followed at the 1958 conclave by the newly elected [[Pope John XXIII]], who bestowed his cardinal's skull cap on [[Alberto di Jorio]] and created him a cardinal at the consistory on 15 December of that year. In 2013 the Portuguese section of Vatican Radio reported that at the conclusion of the 2013 conclave, the newly elected Pope Francis bestowed his cardinalitial [[zucchetto]] on Archbishop [[Lorenzo Baldisseri]], the secretary of that conclave,<ref name=\"Baldisseri news\">{{cite web|url=http://pt.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/16/dom_lorenzo_baldisseri_recebe_solideu_cardinal%C3%ADcio/bra-673713|title=Dom Lorenzo Baldisseri recebe solideu cardinal\u00edcio|publisher=R\u00e1dio Vaticano Portuguese section|language=Portuguese}}</ref> and on 22 February 2014 at Pope Francis' first consistory, Baldisseri was formally made a cardinal with the title of Cardinal-Deacon of Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/166955 | title=Annuncio di Concistoro per la Creazione di Nuovi Cardinali | publisher=[[The Vatican Today]] | date=12 January 2014 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nThen, the new pope goes to the '''Room of Tears''', a small red room next to the Sistine Chapel; the room has the nickname because of the strong emotions experienced by the new pope. The new pope dresses by himself, choosing a set of pontifical robes\u2014consisting of a white [[cassock]], [[rochet]], and red [[mozzetta]]\u2014from three sizes provided. He then wears a gold corded [[pectoral cross]], a red and gold embroidered [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], and then dons the white papal [[zucchetto]] on his head. In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] dispensed with the red mozzetta, rochet, and gold pectoral cross, wearing only the white cassock and his own pectoral cross when he appeared on the central balcony. He also did not emerge wearing the stole, vesting in it only to impart the [[Apostolic Blessing]] and removing it shortly after.\n\nNext, the [[Cardinal Protodeacon]] (the senior Cardinal Deacon) appears at the [[loggia]] of the Basilica to proclaim the new pope. He usually proceeds with the traditional Latin formula (assuming the new Pope was a cardinal):\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:''<br />\n''[[Habemus Papam]]!''<br />\n''Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,''<br />\n''Dominum [forename],''<br />\n''Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem [surname],''<br />\n''qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].''\n{{col-2}}\n''(\"I announce to you a great joy:''<br />\n''We have a Pope!''<br />\n''The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,''<br />\n''Lord [forename],''<br />\n''Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],''<br />\n''who takes to himself the name [papal name].\")''\n{{col-end}}\n\nDuring the announcement for Pope Benedict XVI's election, the cardinal protodeacon, [[Jorge Medina|Jorge Arturo Medina Est\u00e9vez]], greeted the crowds first in several different languages \"Dear brothers and sisters\" before proceeding to the Latin announcement. This was not done when Pope Francis was elected.\n\nIt has happened in the past that the Cardinal Protodeacon has himself been the person elected pope. In such an event, the announcement is made by the next senior Deacon, who has thus succeeded as Protodeacon. The last time the cardinal protodeacon was elected was in 1513 when Giovanni de Medici was elected as [[Pope Leo X]] and the next senior cardinal deacon [[Pope Paul III|Alessandro Farnese]] (the future Pope Paul III) made the announcement.  After the election of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1878, Protodeacon [[Prospero Caterini]] appeared and started to make the announcement but was [[Stage fright|physically incapable of completing it]], so another made it for him.{{efn|Richard Henry Clarke's book about Leo XIII claims that Prospero Caterini made the announcement<ref name=\"Clarke 1878\">{{cite book|title=The life of His Holiness Pope Leo XIII ...: together with extracts from his pastorals and encyclicals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCEMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=papal+elections+%26+Caterini&source=bl&ots=QaXmPJ5Cil&sig=Afavl-zjcOwAPSvXKX7ncgwZT3A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0Mn1UpSlIJDgoAT294CwAg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=papal%20elections%20%26%20Caterini&f=false|author=Richard Henry Clarke}}</ref> and Salvador Miranda's entry on Cardinal Caterini at ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'' website mentions Caterini as having given the announcement<ref name=Caterini>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853.htm#Caterini|work=Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|title=Caterini, Prospero}}</ref> but Francis Burkle-Young claims that Caterini started to make the announcement but was incapable of completing the spoken formula and was ultimately assisted by Bartolomeo Grassi-Landi, a non-cardinal and the conclavist of Cardinal [[Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano]]<ref name=\"Burkle-Young 1878\">{{cite book|title=Papal Elections in the Age of Transition, 1878\u20131922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QxJMdp6FMC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=papal+elections+%26+Caterini&source=bl&ots=4D7lib1pGF&sig=xegvsLW9zC69EWEjcUeeNhhu07k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0Mn1UpSlIJDgoAT294CwAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=papal%20elections%20%26%20Caterini&f=false|author=Francis A.

Founded in 1968 by prominent British royal descendants Oswell E. Spencer and Edward Ashford, along with Dr. James Marcus, it is portrayed in the series as a major international player in pharmaceutical goods and medical supplies, along with more clandestine operations utilizing [[genetic engineering]]. Their legitimate status is only a front for their secret research of \"bio-organic weapons\" (B.O.W.s), developed through the use of a unique virus discovered by the company founders.<ref>''Resident Evil Zero BradyGames Official Strategy Guide'', page 19.</ref> The company is also presented as having a more public face, producing cosmetics, consumer products, and foods. Umbrella established multiple secret research facilities to help develop various bio-weapons. Its most prominent research facility is located in the [[Arklay Mountains]], just outside [[Raccoon City]], which was able to develop the \"T-virus\", a powerful [[mutagen]] that could dramatically alter living and recently dead organisms. The virus leaked and contaminated most of the Arklay Facility and its surrounding area, setting the stage for the first ''Resident Evil'' game. Following the destruction of Raccoon City, all of Umbrella's assets were frozen by the U.S. Government and its trading rights were revoked, effectively terminating its operations. However, it did not stop the rise of several [[bioterrorist]] organizations around the world, some of them making use of its research, leading to the foundation of B.S.A.A. In ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', it is revealed that Umbrella has been reinstated and seemingly reformed as a mercenary group.\n\n====Oswell E. Spencer====\n: Voiced by (English): Adam D.

At one point Jill becomes infected by the T-virus after a battle with \nThe [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. At this point Carlos becomes playable so that the player can prepare a vaccine for Jill. Ultimately he is successful in escaping the city along with Jill. He reprises his role in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', where the events of ''Resident Evil 3'' are revisited in the \"Raccoon's Destruction\" scenario, in which Carlos is a playable character alongside Jill Valentine.\n\nIn the Resident Evil movie franchise, specifically in the second film, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', he is briefly infected with the T-virus, but [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] is able to find a sample of the antivirus in time to cure him. In the third film, he and Alice parted company five years ago when Alice sought to protect her allies from the Umbrella satellites tracking her, but they meet again when he is travelling with a convoy led by Claire Redfield. When Carlos is bitten during an attempt to capture Alice, he volunteers to mount a suicide run on the umbrella complex tracking Alice after it takes a series of prisoners from the convoy, reasoning that there is no time to get a sample of the antivirus before the infection becomes permanent, taking a fuel tanker into the mass of zombies surrounding the base and then setting off a series of bombs, taking out a sizeable number of zombies and breaching the complex defenses.\n\n=====Mikhail Victor=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Benedict Campbell]] (''RE3''), [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] (''REmake 3'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Naoki Tamanoi (''REmake 3'')\n: Motion capture performance by: [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] (''REmake 3'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Mikhail Victor|\u30df\u30cf\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb|Mihairu Vikut\u014dru}} is the leader of the UBCS Delta platoon that both Nicholai and Carlos are members of. According to his backstory, Mikhail is from [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, and had originally served in the army before joining a rebel group. Mikhail was eventually arrested by Russian government forces and convicted for acts of terrorism. He was then coerced into leading the UBCS in exchange for his men's freedom.<ref name=rearchives>''Resident Evil Archives'', 2005, Capcom</ref> In the game, he appears already wounded, choosing to sacrifice his own life to save Jill and Carlos as he dies after being blown apart by his own grenade in a failed attempt to destroy the Nemesis. In an early draft of the story, Mikhail was originally scripted to be Nicholai's older brother, hence their common nationality and close ages (his original name was Mikhail Ginovaef).<ref name=rearchives/> He is the only one of the main UBCS operatives not to appear in the film ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', where he is replaced by an original character named Yuri Loginova.\n\n=====Nicholai Ginovaef=====\n: Voiced by (English): Roger Honeywell (''RE3''), [[Rick D.

According to his backstory, Nicholai is from [[Moscow]] and served in the Russian [[Spetsnaz]] before joining the UBCS. He also has an unspoken rivalry with HUNK from ''Resident Evil 2''. Nikolai meets Jill as one of the few surviving operatives from the Delta platoon, along with Carlos and Mikhail. He disappears after an event in the first half of the game and is presumed dead until another encounter with him. Nikolai is in fact one of the Supervisors UBCS operatives assigned to watch and gather combat data as their comrades fight against Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai's fate varies depending on which route the player takes. In one scene, he is slaughtered by the Nemesis and his corpse is left hanging in an air duct. Another possible outcome shows Nicholai stealing Jill's intended escape helicopter. At this point, the player has the option of attempting to negotiate with him, in which he escapes from the city successfully, or choose to fight back against Nikolai, destroying the helicopter along with him. This is altered in the ''Resident Evil 3'' remake where he is left behind by Jill and Carlos as Racoon City is destroyed, regardless of the player's actions. The English localization of ''[[Resident Evil Survivor]]'' features a document supposedly authored by Nicholai after the events of ''Nemesis''. The file is different in the original Japanese version and the Chinese localization of the PC port. The third entry of the document (the portion dated after the events of ''Nemesis'') was actually authored by the \"Umbrella B.O.W. Development Staff\", rather than Nikolai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projectumbrella.net/articles/Report-After-Raccoon-Citys-Collapse|title=Report After Raccoon City's Collapse|work=projectumbrella.net}}</ref> Nicholai also appears in ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak]]'' in the final scenario \"Decisions, Decisions\" which depicts the character conducting another mission occurring during the same time period as the second half of ''Resident Evil 3''. He is mentioned in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', where he is referred to by the codename \"Silver Fox\". Nicholai's role in ''Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City'' was stopping Wolfpack from completing their mission objective. The character was adapted for the film ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', although the film features a more heroic depiction of Nicholai, which differs from the game's original antagonistic portrayal of the character. In the film's novelization, he was renamed Nicholai Sokolov. Nicholai is ultimately torn to shreds by zombie dogs while holding them off so Alice and Jill can escape.\n\n=====Sergei Vladimir=====\n: Voiced by: [[Patrick Seitz]] (''The Umbrella Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Sergei Vladimir|\u30bb\u30eb\u30b2\u30a4\u30fb\u30a6\u30e9\u30b8\u30df\u30fc\u30eb|Serugei Urajim\u012bru}} is a high-ranking Russian employee of Umbrella and the main antagonist of ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles''.

She awakes during the events of ''Code Veronica'', after her brother Alfred dies. In revenge for this, she sends one of her tentacle monsters to capture Claire and Steve, experimenting on the latter and turning him into a large monster.

After completing his G-virus project, he is mortally wounded by agents of the Umbrella Special Forces and his work is stolen. Left for dead, he injects himself with the G-virus, thus turning himself into a monster known as \"G\". He then kills his attackers, causing a T-virus vial to be leaked into the city's drainage system, resulting in the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. During the course of the game, he encounters the main characters, Claire Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy, as he undergoes gradual mutation and begins losing any resemblance of his original human form. He is eventually defeated by Claire and Leon, with the help of his daughter Sherry. Birkin is mentioned in ''Wesker's Report'' as the scientist who helped Wesker fake his death and is retroactively mentioned in the GameCube remake of the first ''Resident Evil''.

It was founded by Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Clive R. O'Brian, and eight others after the fall of Umbrella, with the aim of combating the increasing numbers of B.O.W.s being sold on the black market. Originally a non-government organization, the BSAA was placed under [[United Nations Security Council]] control when the U.S. government funded Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC) was revealed to be corrupt.\n\n=====Jessica Sherawat=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Ali Hillis]] (''Revelations'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Nana Mizuki]] (''Revelations'')\n\nJessica Sherawat is a member of the FBC, where she worked with Parker Luciani.

Most importantly, Jessica is secretly an agent working for the corrupt Morgan Lansdale and, above all, for Tricell Incorporated. As such, she betrays Chris and the BSAA. She survives the ordeal, and is given a sample of the T-Abyss virus by Raymond Vester.\n\n=====Parker Luciani=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Kirk Thornton]] (''Revelations'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Mitsuru Miyamoto]] (''Revelations'')\n\nParker was originally a member of the FBC tasked with helping out during the 2004 Veltro terrorist attack of Terragrigia. However he and his partner Jessica Sherawat barely managed to make it out alive and fled into the FBC building. During their trip to the Command Room, they met and saved the new cadet, Raymond Vester. He and Parker then bonded. At the command room, they met Morgan Lansdale, who was collaborating with Jack Norman, and in the midst of betraying him. After that, the group escaped the city. In 2005, Parker and Jill followed Chris and Jessica's last known coordinates to a stranded cruise ship named ''Queen Zenobia'' in the Mediterranean Sea. They realized that the entire crew of the Queen Zenobia had been turned into monstrous bio organic weapons named Ooze and are forced to fight for their lives. On the ship's bridge, they are surprised to meet none other than Vester who claims to be there by orders of the FBC. After Jessica is revealed to be a traitor, she sets the Queen Zenobia to self-destruct. Parker was later seen dangling above end then falling into a series of explosions after the floor he was standing on collapsed. It is ultimately revealed that Raymond Vester saved Parker from the explosion. Parker was then found adrift off the shore of the Republic of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea.

He is a talented marksman, who served under Chris Redfield during the Edonian Civil War in 2012. On one of their missions, Carla Radames infects their comrades with the C-virus and turns them into mutants. Chris is knocked unconscious in the ensuing battle but is rescued by Piers. Chris becomes disillusioned and disappears after recovering. Piers tracks down Chris and successfully convinces him to rejoin the BSAA to avenge his dead comrades. They are deployed to Lanshiang, China and tasked to stop a bio-terrorism attack. The duo are eventually led to an underwater laboratory that is being used to create powerful bio-organic weapons. Piers is severely injured during their final battle with the B.O.W., Haos, and injects himself with the C-virus to continue fighting. After he and Chris manage to defeat the Haos, they then attempt to escape the laboratory during its self-destruction sequence, but after realizing that he is beginning to succumb to the C-virus, Piers seals Chris inside an escape pod in order to ensure his survival, while he stays behind during the laboratory's destruction to prevent himself from mutating any further, sacrificing himself in the process. Right before his death, Piers manages to save Chris from the still-alive Haos by killing it as it attempts to destroy the escape pod Chris is in. Chris honors Piers's memory by remaining with the BSAA (when before, Chris thought of retiring and leaving Piers in charge).<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | quote = Piers Nivans is a 26-year-old BSAA operative working for its North American Branch.

He coerces Helena into infecting the president with the C-virus, and later causes viral outbreaks in Tall Oaks. Simmons is later betrayed by Carla Radames and infected with the C-virus. Simmons spontaneously switches between mutations as he fights Leon and Helena to the Quad Tower, where he finally falls to his death.

At the time of the 2004 Terragrigia Panic, Raymond was an inexperienced cadet in the FBC. Injured by Veltro's Farfarello, he was rescued by the more experienced agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. Retreating back to the conference room where FBC Commissioner Morgan Lansdale was residing, Raymond stumbled upon a telephone conversation Lansdale was having with the Veltro leader, Jack Norman. Raymond became increasingly suspicious of his commanding officer, and knew that he was somehow involved with the bio-terrorist attack. However, he was unable to act on these suspicions, as the city was evacuated and destroyed soon after. At some point after this attack, Raymond became an informant for BSAA leader Clive R. O'Brian, operating as his mole within the FBC. O'Brian and Vester devised a plan to oust Lansdale as the architect of the Terragrigia attack through engineering the \"return\" of Veltro. Vester would pose as Jack Norman, and O'Brian used a mountain airbase to create the illusion that the terrorist group had resurfaced. In doing so, the two hoped to collect enough evidence to expose Lansdale. During the Queen Zenobia incident, O'Brian let slip that agents Jessica Sherawat and Chris Redfield were captured by Veltro aboard the Zenobia. Intercepting this information, Lansdale sent Vester and his partner Rachael to the ship to determine if the BSAA agents supposedly on board the vessel would pose any threat to him. Vester and O'Brian agreed to push forward the schedule of their plan. After boarding the ship, Vester, with and without his Veltro disguise, encountered Luciani and Valentine on the ship's bridge, making his presence known. Soon after, Agents Sherawat and Redfield boarded the vessel. Just as Raymond was about to reveal Lansdale's secrets to the group, Lansdale's mole, Jessica Sherawat, shot Raymond in the chest, causing him to fall from the balcony. Though Raymond was wearing a bulletproof vest and was unharmed by Jessica's shot, he faked his death while in her presence and whispered critical information about the conspiracy and her true identity. He later resurfaced and helped a gravely injured Luciani escape the sinking ship. Unbeknown to Parker, both Raymond and Jessica were agents of the pharmaceutical division of TRICELL, which had promoted the development of T-Abyss. The two met in a cafe in an unnamed European country, where Vester provided Sherawat with a sample of the T-Abyss.\n\n====Strategic Command====\n=====Bruce McGivern=====\n: Voiced by (English): Raj Ramayya (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroaki Hirata]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nWhen a large amount of a recently developed hybrid viral agent known as the \"T+G Virus\" was stolen from the Umbrella Pharmaceuticals Development Center in [[Paris]] by a former Umbrella researcher, Bruce McGivern was sent in by the U.S. government to retrieve the virus and neutralize the threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on board an Umbrella-owned luxury ocean liner, the ''Spencer Rain'', whose entire personnel on board have been infected with the T-virus stolen by the same former researcher, Morpheus D. Duvall, in September 2002. A member of the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]], McGivern is cocky and brash, and has a tendency to adopt a \"shoot first, ask questions later\" policy, with little regard for the consequences following his actions. This has often left him in many hostile situations, although in the end, he always somehow comes out on top. Confronted at the very beginning of the game by Duvall, he is saved by Chinese secret agent Fong Ling who throws a grenade at Morpheus (regardless of Bruce's life), seriously wounding the terrorist. He later works with her in order to stop Duvall's plan of unleashing the virus, bringing the fight to an underwater Umbrella secret laboratory which they ultimately destroy as Bruce kills a greatly mutated Duvall. At first at odds with Fong Ling, she and Bruce become closer as the story progresses, particularly after he saves her from an attempt on her life by her own government through the use of satellites armed with lasers. At the end of the game, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\n====MSS====\n=====Fong Ling=====\n: Voiced by (English): Claire O'Connor (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kae Araki]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nA Chinese intelligence agent employed by the [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]], Fong is infamous for her cold and stoic demeanor. Upon learning of her brother's involvement in anti-government activism, Fong arrested him. Following his arrest, Fong's brother was swiftly executed, although she never questioned the actions of her boss and remained absolutely loyal, stopping at nothing to accomplish her objectives. She is sent by the Chinese government to the Umbrella-owned luxury liner ''Spencer Rain'' to stop former Umbrella scientist Morpheus Duvall's plans and retrieve the sample of the virus he stole from an Umbrella's lab in Paris. Initially apathetic towards the presence of a rival operative, Bruce McGivern, going so far as to throw a grenade at Duvall who was holding him at gunpoint, she allies with him in order to stop Duvall. At some point, the Chinese government betrays her and attempts to kill her through the use of satellites armed with lasers. But Bruce saves her. Though greatly shaken by this event, she decides to complete her mission and to keep working for her employers afterward. And from that moment on, she becomes closer to Bruce. After killing Duvall and destroying an Umbrella secret laboratory underwater, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===NGOs===\nA [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) is an organization that is neither a part of a recognized government nor a conventional for-profit business.\n\n====TerraSave====\nTerraSave is a non-governmental human rights organization introduced in ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]''.\n\n=====Moira Burton=====\n: Voiced by (English): Marcella Lentz-Pope (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ayumi Fujimura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nMoira is the eldest daughter of STARS veteran, Barry Burton. In ''Resident Evil: Revelations 2'', Moira and her TerraSave co-workers including Claire Redfield are captured and taken to an abandoned prison facility supervised by Alex Wesker. Moira is a secondary character in Claire's portion of the game. She refuses to use firearms after accidentally wounding her sister with a handgun as a child. Instead, Moira uses tools, such as crowbars, to break open boxes and to attack enemies. She is estranged from her father. Eventually while fighting a mutated Neil Fisher, who betrayed the Terra Save group, Moira overcomes her fear of using a gun in order to save Claire if the player selects this option, which is canon. Moira is separated from Claire and saved by Evgeny, a Russian man who later chooses death once his daughter is dead. Moira then returns to save her father and friends from Alex Wesker, who is now fully mutated. Alex, however, lives on through possessing to some degree Natalia, who had become Moira's adoptive sister.\n\n=====Neil Fisher=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Eiji Hanawa (''Revelations 2'')\n\nNeil Fisher is a high-ranking member of TerraSave and senior officer of Claire Redfield. He was also involved with the organization's operations during the [[Resident Evil: Revelations|Terragrigia incident]], where he met and looked after a young Natalia Korda. However, unknown to other TerraSave members, Neil was affiliated with the FBC, primarily its director Morgan Lansdale. After it was disbanded during the events of ''Resident Evil: Revelations'', Neil plans to start another bioterrorist attack to justify the return of the FBC. To achieve this end, he contacts Alex Wesker and helps her organize the kidnapping of several members of TerraSave for experimentation with her T-Phobos virus. In return, he would receive a vial of Albert Wesker's Uroboros virus to start his bioterrorist attack. After helping Alex procure Natalia for the purposes of transferring her mind into the girl's body, she betrays Neil by injecting the virus into his body and sends him down to the lower levels of her tower, to fight Claire and Moira Burton. Mutating into a hulking beast, he is killed during their fight when shot at point-blank range in the head by either Claire or Moira (canonically the latter).\n\n====Neo-Umbrella====\n=====Carla Radames=====\n{{see also|Ada Wong}}\n\nCarla Radames is the primary antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''. She is the founder and leader of Neo-Umbrella, a terrorist organization that  strives on destroying  the current world order. Radames, a former government researcher, is the creator of the C-virus, a powerful mutagen capable of turning humans into capable and competent bio-organic weapons. Derek Simmons performs experiments on Carla which ultimately turn her into a clone of Ada Wong. While Carla possesses Ada's physical appearance and mannerisms, she still retains her original psyche. She also harbors a deep resentment towards Simmons, whom she believes stole her research and lifework. Radames personally oversees the bio-terror attacks in Europe, the United States, and China. She exacts revenge on Simmons by having her henchmen infect him with a potent dosage of the C-virus, which turns him into ravenous monster. She is fatally shot by a helicopter sent by the Family, but thanks to injecting herself with an enhanced C-virus, Radames mutated into a formless mass. She is eventually confronted and killed by Ada Wong.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 4 | quote = Carla Radames was responsible for the discovery of the C-Virus, and a close confidant of Derek C.

He is given a Dominant Species of the Plaga Parasite, allowing him to command others infected with Las Plagas and granting him incredible strength. Mendez is confronted numerous times throughout the first two chapters of Resident Evil 4 by Leon Kennedy, during the latter's attempt to save the President's daughter from the village. In their last confrontation in a barn, Mendez is forced to mutate after being doused in gasoline and set on fire, eventually detaching the lower part of his body and using the rafters to traverse and attack Leon.

Jack is a middle-aged man and a member of the Baker family who are victims of Eveline, and have captured Ethan's wife, Mia. The Bakers were thought to have vanished from the local community in Dulvey, Louisiana.\n\nNot long after the game was announced, Jack became known for his various one-liners such as \"Welcome to the family, son!\" heard in the various demo footage.<ref name=\"demo2\">{{cite news |last=Relph |first=Lauren |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-7-first-hour-true-ending-walkthrough |title=How to get the true ending in Resident Evil 7: First Hour demo for Xbox One and PC |work=Windows Central |date=2017-01-07 |accessdate=2017-01-22 }}</ref> Jack relentlessly pursues Ethan from area to area, being very strong and somehow appears to be nearly unstoppable. He uses a variety of weapons and can attack you even after being set ablaze when a car bursts into flames inside a garage. To prove to Ethan he is not human, he also takes his gun and seemingly dies after blowing his own head off, only to rise again and continue pursuing Ethan. Jack also murders a policeman who had come across Ethan after they entered the garage. During one such encounter, Ethan ultimately defeats Jack one last time after he has majorly mutated, but Jack later appears in a dream like scene as a normal man due to Ethan having used the serum to cure him.

Marguerite was first shown in the various footage that was unveiled during 2016, including a clip featuring the scene where her family have the main protagonist Ethan Winters seated at the dinner table. Marguerite was more prominently featured in the ''Lantern'' demo, following Mia, Ethan's wife. She can summon insects to swarm together and attack Ethan, but he defeats her nonetheless.

Clancy is killed after engaging a trap, and Ethan watches a tape that reveals how his death occurred to ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate. Lucas survives the events because he is never faced in combat.

She is frequently spying on her subjects via CCTV. uses quotes by [[Franz Kafka]] and captures Natalia Korda, the little girl Barry Burton meets upon reaching the island Moira was stuck on. During some scenes, Alex is clearly seen in her mutated form as well, and controls the \"Afflicted\". Alex had captured Natalia to experiment on her, intending to transfer her own consciousness into Natalia's body. Regardless of the ending achieved by the player in ''Revelations 2'', good or bad, Alex manages, possibly to different degrees, to transfer her mind into Natalia's body and take over it. In the bonus episode \"Little Miss\", which takes place before Barry's arrival to the island, players assume control of Natalia and her mysterious evil twin as they look for the toy bear Lottie. This reveals Alex had already started her experience and her mind was present in Natalia's subconscious as the \"evil twin\".\n\n====Ark Thompson====\n: Voiced by: [[Patrick Harlan]] (''Resident Evil: Survivor'')\n\nArk Thompson is an acquaintance of Leon S.

A journalist, he investigates Chief Brian Irons and Umbrella during their attempts to cover up the Mansion Incident. Eventually discovering evidence linking him to Umbrella, he is arrested and held in the RPD holding cells. In the original game, Ben is approached by Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong on information he has uncovered on Umbrella and helps them escape the building. However, he is killed by William Birkin before he can be released from his cell<!--Method changes depending on the scenario played-->. Before dying, he gives Leon evidence linking Irons to a coverup of the G-virus. In the game's remake, Ben's role is significantly reduced to a brief meeting with Leon. He offers his parking pass to escape the building in exchange for his release, but is killed by the Tyrant before Leon can decide. Opening his cell, Leon retrieves both the pass and a recording of him confronting Annette Birkin on Umbrella's actions and the creation of the G-virus. Ben also appears in ''The Darkside Chronicles'', though he is killed off-screen by Birkin before he can meet Leon, Claire or Ada.\n\n====Billy Coen====\n: Voiced by: David Webster (''RE0''), [[Steve Van Wormer]] (''The Umbrella Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Billy Coen|\u30d3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3|Bir\u012b K\u014den}} is first mentioned in a police report filed by Rebecca Chambers that can be found in the [[Nintendo 64]] version of ''Resident Evil 2'', foreshadowing the events of the prequel, ''Resident Evil Zero''.

In the past, Helena was known to be very protective towards Deborah, having wounded Deborah's abusive ex-boyfriend. In ''Resident Evil 6'', the two sisters were held as hostages by Derek C. Simmons in the secret lab underneath the Tall Oaks Cathedral. Helena tried her best to keep a terrified Deborah calm and assures her. Helena offered herself to Simmons in exchange for her sister, but her pleas did nothing and Deborah was dragged away. Deborah was later taken to the catacombs of the cathedral, and was injected with C-Virus; however, as she showed no signs of mutation, Deborah was left to die. After Helena and Leon rescue Deborah, they soon arrive at the lower levels of the catacombs, where Deborah becomes very ill before bursting into flames; a goo then hardens into a cocoon around her. As the lower levels then begin to crumble, Deborah emerges with spider-like appendages on her back. Despite Helena's pleas not to harm her sister, Ada reminds her that Deborah has to be killed or else they will die. After the battle, Helena grabs Deborah as she slips and falls over a pit. She then begs for forgiveness, saying she will avenge her sister after she and Leon kill Simmons, and releases Deborah as she falls to her death into the darkness below. At the end of Leon and Helena's campaign, Helena visits Deborah's grave at a cemetery.\n\n====Ethan Winters====\n: Voiced by (English): Todd Soley (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]] (''RE7'')\nEthan is the protagonist of the game ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Ethan is an American systems engineer looking for his missing wife, Mia. Mia went missing over 3 years ago after she sent a video message to Ethan, talking about how much she was looking forward to coming home. Ethan then suddenly receives a disturbing video message and an email from Mia, so he tells an unknown friend that he is heading out to search for her in Dulvey, Louisiana. This leads him to a derelict plantation mansion, that also happens to be the home of the deranged Baker family, who have been driven insane due to being infected with the Mold from Eveline.\n\nAfter viewing a tape he finds regarding a camera crew being attacked in the same house, he soon finds his wife in a hidden area lying in a cell, but Mia acts peculiar as they look for a way out, and disappears. She then attacks Ethan with a kitchen knife. The ensuing chaos leads to Mia throwing Ethan through a wall. However, he manages to \"kill\" her using an ax and pistol. Eventually, she gets up, corners Ethan, and pins him to the wall by his hand with a screwdriver, then cuts off Ethan's pinned hand. Ethan knocks Mia out, and then suddenly, a man attacks Ethan and knocks him out, taking both Ethan and Mia back inside the house. Ethan's severed hand is reattached by a woman named Zoe (the only sane member of the Baker family) and then later, Ethan manages to become untied at the dinner table due to a police officer ringing a telephone, which distracted the Bakers, who were planning to torture him for refusing to eat with them. Ethan manages to fully mend his hand but learns that the Bakers cannot be \"killed\" very easily.\n\nMia, as it turns out, is also infected by Eveline, as is Zoe, and therefore not dead. Although Mia and Zoe have to find a way to escape as well. However, Zoe explains that they need to be cured first using a serum as they cannot leave until this is fulfilled. Ethan also encounters other abnormal monsters created by Eveline, such as the creatures called the Molded. But escaping the premises is made extremely difficult, as the Bakers relentlessly pursue him, and Ethan has to protect himself using whatever means he can find, so he can ultimately overcome each family member.\n\nEthan attempts to get in contact with a military group for his rescue while learning more about Eveline as an \"E-Series\" Bioweapon. After Ethan is assisted by the military group via chopper and finally puts a stop to Eveline, he and Mia are rescued by Chris Redfield, who is working with the newly reformed Umbrella Corporation. At the conclusion of the ''End of Zoe'' sub-chapter, Ethan talks to Zoe by phone and she finds out he kept his promise to send help, and Zoe is cured.\n\n====Evgeny Rebic====\n:Voiced by (English): Walter Rego (''Revelations 2'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ben Hiura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nRebic is an old [[Russians|Russian]] man Claire and Moira meet on the island they are trapped on in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. He is a miner who is not happy that they are potentially alerting the afflicted to his hideout; Moira ends up doing this by mistake while later spending time with him after her near death experience that resulted in her being away from Claire for 6 months. Although Evegeny is just a bit part character in the main game, he is the co-op partner of Moira in \"The Struggle\" bonus episode, and uses a rifle to shoot wild animals (for food) and kill enemies. He rescued Moira beneath all the debris that fell on her, but does not call her by that name afterwards, and he teaches her to hunt for herself, while they are putting up with one another's whining. He later learns his missing daughter named Irina is already dead and feeling unwell, Evgeny chooses to die in the underground, with Evgeny and Moira revealing their names to each other just before he passes. His body is eventually found by Barry and Natalia.\n\n====Eveline====\n: Voiced by (English): Patricia McNeely (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), Paula Rhodes (''RE7'' (Young))\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Yuri Tabata (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), [[Sumire Morohoshi]] (''RE7'' (Young))\n\nEveline is the main antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Considered as an \"E-Class\" B.O.W. codenamed \"E-001\", Eveline is a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] human created by a mysterious group called \"The Connections\" with the help from H.C.F (one of the companies owned by Albert Wesker) by fusing a Progenitor-enhanced fungus called Mutamycete into her genome during embryonic stage. Designed for the company's NEXBAS (Next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) initiative, the project was designed to create a B.O.W. capable of blending in with the population, neutralizing combatants without direct contact and converting enemies into allies. Ultimately, the project folded due to reservations regarding methodology and the difficultly of controlling the resultant product B.O.W., particularly in comparison to other projects. Eveline was the first successful E-Class prototype. She infected people using mold and fungus, allowing her to create a legion of people that she perceived as her \"family\", and thereby command and convert them into the \"Molded\". Due to the bioweapon's destructive abilities and mind control capabilities,  E-Class project materials were sought after by rival companies.  This state of affairs resulted in Mia Winters and Alan Droney, members of The Connections, travelling with Eveline upon a cargo ship bound for a facility in Central America.  When a hurricane hit the ship, Eveline became unstable.  Eveline infected Alan, and turned the crew into the Molded. Mia has no choice but to track Eveline and kill the former crew. Mia was helpless as Eveline killed Alan and subsequently infected her.  Mia attempted to send Ethan a second video message prior to the ship's destruction, wish him a happy life and urging him not to search for her.\n\nEveline and Mia were both later found and taken in by the Baker family, who happened upon the husk of the cargo ship in the Louisiana bayou. Eveline infected the Baker family within the month, on which put them under her control. Two years after, Eveline's mind and body were deteriorating rapidly due to lack of her medication and the degenerative effects of her condition, prompting her to demand the Bakers to add more people to her family by kidnapping or killing them. Zoe Baker was the only one not affected by Eveline's mind control while brother Lucas Baker was subsequently cured and pretended to work with his family, cognizant that Eveline was a threat.\n\nAfter Ethan arrived at the Baker family residence, he was helped by Zoe. When he finally learned of Eveline's origins, he used the equipment in the lab deep in the nearby Salt Mines to develop a necrotoxin using Eveline's DNA, which was capable of killing her. He succeeded on injecting Eveline with the necroxtoin, in the process learning that Eveline's true form is actually that of an old woman, demonstrating that rapid aging was an unintended byproduct of the project, as had been implied by internal project documents. After Eveline is injected with the necrotoxin, she mutated into a giant grotesque form as her powers spiral out of control. With the help from the reformed Umbrella Corporation and Chris Redfield, Ethan succeeded in fully killing Eveline before being rescued.\n\n====Jake Muller====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Troy Baker]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Namikawa]] (''RE6'')\n: Motion capture: [[Troy Baker]], Daniel Southworth (stunt double)\n\nJake Muller is the son of the Albert Wesker, a eugenicist, virologist and bioterrorist, who formerly worked for Umbrella.

Jake, later works as a freelance mercenary in order to support his mother, whom dies of an unknown chronic disease shortly after Jake receives money for her treatment. Jake was caught up in an act of bioterrorism while operating in anti-government operations in the fictional  Eastern European republic of Edonia. His mercenary comrades are infected with the C-virus, but Jake's specialized blood resists the infection. Soon after, he meets US government agent Sherry Birkin \u2013 whose father, William Birkin, was coincidentally Albert's research partner. Sherry and Jake take part in the subsequent battle between the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance and the mutated mercenaries.<ref name=\"Jake's story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/bio6/story_jake.html|title=CAPCOM\uff1aBIOHAZARD 6 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 - STORY|work=capcom.co.jp}}</ref> With his blood resistant to the downside-effects of mutagenic viruses like his father, Jake also inherited several of his father's signature abilities such as increased strength, speed, healing, and advanced combat skills. He demands a large sum of money from the BSAA, in order to sample a pint of his blood to be synthesize for vaccination to combat the C-virus. He and Sherry are captured by Carla Radames, a doppelg\u00e4nger of Ada Wong, and held captive in Lanshiang, China. They escape during the C-virus outbreak in the city six months later. Over the course of the story of ''RE6'', Jake comes to terms with both the knowledge of his father's actions and of his death at the hands of Chris Redfield three years earlier. After the ordeal, Jake starts a new life fighting BOWs in an underdeveloped country with his real identity covered up by the BSAA.\n\n====Joe Baker====\n:Voiced by (English): Gage Maverik (''RE7'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[K\u014dsei Hirota]] (''RE7'')\nJoe Baker is the main protagonist in the ''End of Zoe'' [[downloadable content]] chapter, for ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-biohazards-not-a-hero-end-of-zoe-d/1100-6454102/|title=Resident Evil 7: Biohazard's Not A Hero, End Of Zoe DLC Further Detailed With New Trailer|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=17 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The brother of Jack Baker, he lives in the nearby swamplands near the Baker estate, though is isolated from the rest of the family and unaffected by Eveline's control. During the chapter, Joe discovers his niece, Zoe, shortly after the events of the main game and tries to find a cure to free her from Eveline's influence. To do so, he battles against the remnants of the molded creatures created by the Bakers and a mysterious creature chasing after them, later revealed to be a resurrected Jack. Joe ultimately kills his brother and is able to cure Zoe, after which they are found and extracted by the Umbrella Corps. Although he can use firearms, Joe mostly fights with his bare hands, though later acquires an Umbrella Corps glove to increase his strength prior to his final battle with Jack.\n\n====Katherine Warren====\nKatherine Warren is the daughter of Raccoon City's Mayor, Michael Warren. Left behind in Raccoon City by her father, she is left in the care of Chief Brian Irons.

A member of an unnamed organization, possibly a former rival of Umbrella, Mia was tasked with escorting a bio-weapon called Eveline to another facility. However, the tanker is attacked and crashes in a [[Louisiana]]n swamp. Found by the Baker family, Eveline infects them, planning to start a family of its own, hence the reason Mia and the Bakers were its earliest known victims. However, Mia also briefly serves as an antagonist due to being infected by Eveline, causing her to attack her husband shortly after he found her in a holding cell beneath the house. Mia is seemingly \"killed\" by her husband in self-defense after having an axe plunged into her neck, but despite this, she isn't truly dead because of Eveline.\n\nBoth Mia and Ethan are taken by Jack Baker, and Mia recovers off screen. From that point on, Mia works with a woman called Zoe (who is revealed to be a Baker) and Ethan tries to save them by receiving hints from Zoe when she telephones him, while Ethan is having to deal with constant attacks perpetrated by the other Bakers. In some parts of the game, Mia is playable too, but sometimes she has to hide rather than confront enemies. After using a cure created by Zoe to kill Jack, Ethan must use the remaining vial to save either Mia or Zoe. Depending on a choice made by the player, Ethan can either cure Mia and attempt to escape with her, or choose Zoe, leaving her behind. After Ethan and the person he chose to save is attacked, the player once again takes control of Mia, searching the tanker for him. After freeing him, Mia will start to become possessed by Eveline again. Depending on the player's earlier decision, Mia will separate herself from Ethan to save him or allow Eveline to take control of her, forcing Ethan to kill her. If the former plays out, she will be recovered by [[Umbrella Corps]] mercenaries, reuniting with Ethan as the game ends.\n\n====Natalia Korda====\n: Voiced by (English): Gabriella Pastore (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (''Revelations 2'')\nA young girl who is a playable character in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. Natalia accompanies [[Barry Burton]] immediately when he arrives on an island to search for his missing daughter, Moira. Natalia explains that she is an orphan due to the death of her parents. Natalia can find items that are hidden, detect the presence of invisible or off-screen enemies (indicated by a glowing effect) and go through small passageways to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Since Natalia cannot use any firearms, she can pick up bricks to throw at any monsters, but often has to evade the monsters.\n\nAlex Wesker targets Natalia throughout the course of the plot in order to [[mind uploading|mind transfer herself]] into her, believing she is not \"true\" like she is. Alex (when in a grotesque form near the climax of the game), causes Natalia's fear to reach its highest on her wrist bracelet, but it is not explained what happens to Natalia. In a prequel segment, '''Dark Natalia''' joined Natalia to help find \"Lottie\", Natalia's beloved teddy bear, and she then begins her association with Barry, now having the ability to see any monsters that Barry cannot always notice. In the true ending, it was revealed prior to Alex mutating into her third and final form that she was able to transfer her mind into Natalia's body up until the young girl's body had been fully taken over by Alex, in 2013. Barry adopts Natalia after Alex is killed, but she is seen reading a piece by [[Franz Kafka]] then smiling, so Alex succeeded to some degree.\n\n====Robert Kendo====\n:Voiced by (English): Gary Krawford (RE2), Jason C. Miller (DC)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Hideki Tanaka (REmake 2)\nRobert Kendo is the owner of a gun store in Raccoon City. He and his brother Joseph are responsible for creating the Samurai Edge pistols used by S.T.A.R.S. members.  In the original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', he briefly appears in the opening of Scenario A, allowing the player to stay in his gunshop for protection. However, zombies soon break in and devour Kendo, leaving a weapon for the player to pick up. In the remake, Robert confronts Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong as they attempt to pass through the shop to reach the sewers. It's also revealed he has a daughter, Emma, who he tries to protect from the outbreak. However, she is infected and Robert is forced to kill her. Kendo also appears in the game's ''The Ghost Survivors'' DLC as the player character in \"No Time to Mourn\". A non-canonical scenario, it follows him as he attempts to escape Raccoon City.<ref>https://www.altchar.com/games-news/586950/resident-evil-2-remake-will-get-three-free-dlc-stories</ref><ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/resident-evil-2-the-ghost-survivors-detailed-ahead-of-the-free-dlcs-launch-this-friday/</ref> He also appears in ''The Darkside Chronicles'', though is killed offscreen before he encounters either Leon or Claire.\n\n====Steve Burnside====\n: Voiced by: Bill Houston (''Code Veronica''), [[Sam Riegel]] (''The Darkside Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Steve Burnside|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|Sut\u012bbu B\u0101nsaido}} is [[Claire Redfield]]'s partner in the game ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. Steve was imprisoned in the Rockfort Island's facility alongside his father, a former Umbrella employee. He escapes from his cell during the viral outbreak. At first, Steve is hesitant to trust Claire and only cooperates with her reluctantly, but later becomes more open and attached to her after he is forced to kill his own father, who has become a zombie during the outbreak. Steve and Claire eventually end up in Umbrella's Antarctic Facility, where he is captured by Alexia and used as a test subject for the T-Veronica virus. Claire meets a chained Steve, who mutates into a monster and attacks Claire; in this form, he is nearly invulnerable to damage, and wields a giant, ceremonial axe. While running from Steve, Claire is attacked by one of Alexia's tentacles. Steve, seeing this, regains control of his mind and cuts the tentacle apart, freeing Claire. In retaliation, Alexia strikes him with one of the tentacles, inflicting a mortal wound. His failing body finally rejects the mutation, and he changes back. He dies in Claire's arms, just after professing his love to her. He was later taken by Albert Wesker due to the T-Veronica virus in his body, and also hinted that he might come back to life. In ''The Darkside Chronicles'' it is revealed that Wesker contacted the drug baron Javier Hidalgo and took a sample of T-Veronica from Steve's corpse in order to sell the virus for Hidalgo's ailing daughter, Manuela.\n\n====Zoe Baker====\n: Voiced by (English): Giselle Gilbert (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016b Kobayashi]] (''RE7'')\n: Face model: [[Ananda Jacobs]] (''RE7'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anandajacobs.com/about|title=About \u2014 Ananda Jacobs|website=anandajacobs.com|accessdate=June 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZoe is the youngest member of the Baker family in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' set in 2017, and despite being infected by Eveline like the rest of her family, Zoe is somewhat normal, and serves as a supporting character. Zoe gets in contact with Ethan Winters by telephone several times, asking Ethan if \"Daddy\" gave him a hard time, as well as giving him tips on how to advance through the area. She was also the person who attached Ethan's severed hand back on after his wife Mia had cut it off, when she temporarily turned crazy. Working alongside of Mia thereafter, Zoe explains to Ethan that due to being infected, a serum needs to be given to each of them before they can escape too. Unfortunately, Ethan has to use one of the two vials to stop the heavily mutated Jack Baker when he returned yet again to try to finish off Ethan, leaving only one dosage remaining. The player can then choose to cure either Mia or Zoe, leading to an alternate story playing out: If Mia is selected, Zoe stays behind to die with the rest of her family, displaying anger over the fact that she felt she never had a future. It is unknown if she is alive during this path, but she is seen during Ethan and Jack's conversation scene. If Zoe is chosen to be cured, she and Ethan try to escape. However, they are both attacked by Eveline, during which Zoe is engulfed by her, killing her.\n\nIn the ''Daughters'' [[downloadable content]] sub-chapter, players control Zoe Baker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameranx.com/features/id/93190/article/resident-evil-7-daughters-dlc-how-to-unlock-all-the-endings/ |title=Resident Evil 7: Daughters DLC {{!}} How to Unlock All The Endings |website=gameranx.com}}</ref> just as her father rescues Mia and Eveline out in the swamp. Jack brings Eveline into their home during stormy weather to rest up in Lucas' bedroom, but as Zoe is about to change her wet clothes, Eveline looks up, saying, \"They're mine now!\" and then runs off, laughing maniacally. The power goes out at the same time. Eveline has begun converting the Bakers to her cause, as Zoe finds her mother has gone crazy and attempts to attack her. Jack tries to hold off Marguerite and tells Zoe to get rope from the garage, but by the time she comes back upstairs with it, Jack has already turned, trying to drown Marguerite in the bathtub, and Zoe has to escape through the recreation room as he gives chase. She also witnesses her father dragging Lucas along a hallway. This canonical prequel chapter is strategy based, as Zoe must flee from rather than fight her parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.primagames.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/tips/resident-evil-7-how-get-true-ending-daughters-dlc-tape|title=Resident Evil 7 - How to Get the True Ending of the Daughters DLC Tape|website=Prima Games}}</ref> There's two possible endings: Zoe can either enter the trailer after finding out the passcode number from the attic to learn of the location of a key item, and finds Mia in her trailer, as well as an important note she wrote, or she can use the car keys given to her by her mother, which results in a poor ending due to the player choosing the \"wrong path\" for Zoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/02/resident-evil-7-walkthrough-how-to-get-best-ending-banned-footage-vol-2/|title=Resident Evil 7 Daughters walkthrough: how to get the best ending in Banned Footage Vol 2 DLC|date=2 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHer uncle Joe finds Zoe and two Umbrella operatives who claim they are trying to save her. He takes one hostage, but he later gets killed by Jack. Joe fist fights his way through a marsh to locate a cure. He injects Zoe with some serum he took off a dead soldier, but it only partially heals her. Out in the swamp, he has to get the other half, and ultimately kill his brother, the very much alive, but horribly mutated Jack. Zoe is eventually completely cured after Jack is killed once and for all, and then Ethan contacts her, to reveal he kept his promise to send her help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA5NBfGSZTM|title=RESIDENT EVIL 7 End of Zoe Gameplay Walkthrough Full Game (Xbox One X) No Commentary|first=|last=RabidRetrospectGames|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Characters created for the film series==\n{{main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n{{see also|Resident Evil (film series)}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|author=Capcom Staff|authorlink=Capcom|year=2005|publisher=[[BradyGames]]/[[Capcom]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4}}\n* {{Cite book|script-title=ja:\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9 \u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9|language=Japanese|author=Capcom Staff|isbn=4-906582-31-1|date=March 2005}}\n\n{{Resident Evil}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Resident Evil Characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of Capcom characters|Resident Evil]]\n[[Category:Resident Evil characters| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Resident Evil'' characters}}\nThis is a '''list of ''Resident Evil'' characters''', which includes playable and recurring characters that were introduced in ''[[Resident Evil]]'', a series of [[survival horror]] video games.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Appearances==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: lightgreen\"| <div style=\"color: lightgreen\">__________</div>\n| Major character\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: lightyellow\" | <div style=\"color: lightyellow\">__________</div>\n| Supporting\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: lightblue\" | <div style=\"color: lightblue\">__________</div>\n| DLC/other\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: lightgrey\" | <div style=\"color:lightgrey\">__________</div>\n| {{nowrap|No appearances}}\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small> P - [[Playable character]] (campaign/unlockable-mini campaign) </small><br>\n<small>P* - Playable character (minigame/DLC)</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20%\" | Character\n! colspan=\"11\" align=\"center\" | Game\n! rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | Total\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil Zero|RE0]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|RE1]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil 2|RE2]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis|RE3]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|CV]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil 4|RE4]]''\n! align=\"center\" |''[[Resident Evil: Revelations|Rev]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil 5|RE5]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2|Rev2]]''\n! align=\"center\" |''[[Resident Evil 6|RE6]]''\n! align=\"center\" | ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard|RE7]]''\n|-\n!

Founded in 1968 by prominent British royal descendants Oswell E. Spencer and Edward Ashford, along with Dr. James Marcus, it is portrayed in the series as a major international player in pharmaceutical goods and medical supplies, along with more clandestine operations utilizing [[genetic engineering]]. Their legitimate status is only a front for their secret research of \"bio-organic weapons\" (B.O.W.s), developed through the use of a unique virus discovered by the company founders.<ref>''Resident Evil Zero BradyGames Official Strategy Guide'', page 19.</ref> The company is also presented as having a more public face, producing cosmetics, consumer products, and foods. Umbrella established multiple secret research facilities to help develop various bio-weapons. Its most prominent research facility is located in the [[Arklay Mountains]], just outside [[Raccoon City]], which was able to develop the \"T-virus\", a powerful [[mutagen]] that could dramatically alter living and recently dead organisms. The virus leaked and contaminated most of the Arklay Facility and its surrounding area, setting the stage for the first ''Resident Evil'' game. Following the destruction of Raccoon City, all of Umbrella's assets were frozen by the U.S. Government and its trading rights were revoked, effectively terminating its operations. However, it did not stop the rise of several [[bioterrorist]] organizations around the world, some of them making use of its research, leading to the foundation of B.S.A.A. In ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', it is revealed that Umbrella has been reinstated and seemingly reformed as a mercenary group.\n\n====Oswell E. Spencer====\n: Voiced by (English): Adam D.

According to his backstory, Nicholai is from [[Moscow]] and served in the Russian [[Spetsnaz]] before joining the UBCS. He also has an unspoken rivalry with HUNK from ''Resident Evil 2''. Nikolai meets Jill as one of the few surviving operatives from the Delta platoon, along with Carlos and Mikhail. He disappears after an event in the first half of the game and is presumed dead until another encounter with him. Nikolai is in fact one of the Supervisors UBCS operatives assigned to watch and gather combat data as their comrades fight against Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai's fate varies depending on which route the player takes. In one scene, he is slaughtered by the Nemesis and his corpse is left hanging in an air duct. Another possible outcome shows Nicholai stealing Jill's intended escape helicopter. At this point, the player has the option of attempting to negotiate with him, in which he escapes from the city successfully, or choose to fight back against Nikolai, destroying the helicopter along with him. This is altered in the ''Resident Evil 3'' remake where he is left behind by Jill and Carlos as Racoon City is destroyed, regardless of the player's actions. The English localization of ''[[Resident Evil Survivor]]'' features a document supposedly authored by Nicholai after the events of ''Nemesis''. The file is different in the original Japanese version and the Chinese localization of the PC port. The third entry of the document (the portion dated after the events of ''Nemesis'') was actually authored by the \"Umbrella B.O.W. Development Staff\", rather than Nikolai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projectumbrella.net/articles/Report-After-Raccoon-Citys-Collapse|title=Report After Raccoon City's Collapse|work=projectumbrella.net}}</ref> Nicholai also appears in ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak]]'' in the final scenario \"Decisions, Decisions\" which depicts the character conducting another mission occurring during the same time period as the second half of ''Resident Evil 3''. He is mentioned in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', where he is referred to by the codename \"Silver Fox\". Nicholai's role in ''Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City'' was stopping Wolfpack from completing their mission objective. The character was adapted for the film ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', although the film features a more heroic depiction of Nicholai, which differs from the game's original antagonistic portrayal of the character.

Chris becomes disillusioned and disappears after recovering. Piers tracks down Chris and successfully convinces him to rejoin the BSAA to avenge his dead comrades. They are deployed to Lanshiang, China and tasked to stop a bio-terrorism attack. The duo are eventually led to an underwater laboratory that is being used to create powerful bio-organic weapons. Piers is severely injured during their final battle with the B.O.W., Haos, and injects himself with the C-virus to continue fighting. After he and Chris manage to defeat the Haos, they then attempt to escape the laboratory during its self-destruction sequence, but after realizing that he is beginning to succumb to the C-virus, Piers seals Chris inside an escape pod in order to ensure his survival, while he stays behind during the laboratory's destruction to prevent himself from mutating any further, sacrificing himself in the process.

Sherry is a playable character in some parts of the game but she is completely unarmed and can only avoid the monsters. Her father has been transformed into a monstrous creature by the G-virus and infects her, but Claire gives Sherry an anti-virus, which prevents her from mutating. Sherry assists Leon and Claire in boarding a secret underground train, and successfully escapes Raccoon City before it is destroyed. Sherry also appears in ''Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles'' in chapters that recapitulate the events of ''Resident Evil 2''.

Simmons is the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and a close friend to Adam Benford. He is the leader of a secret organization known as \"The Family\", which uses its vast political influence to maintain world order. Simmons worries that Benford's plan to declassify the Raccoon City incident will create civil unrest around the world and tarnish the United States' reputation. He coerces Helena into infecting the president with the C-virus, and later causes viral outbreaks in Tall Oaks. Simmons is later betrayed by Carla Radames and infected with the C-virus. Simmons spontaneously switches between mutations as he fights Leon and Helena to the Quad Tower, where he finally falls to his death. A unique feature of Simmons' mutation is that he could absorb zombies to add more mass to his body, which took the form of a giant insect as a result.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 3 | quote = The Family has been manipulating the course of human development for a long time. Their ostensible goal is to maintain stability in the world, but its true motivation lies in exploiting events to benefit its members. For now, they believe maintaining that stability is contingent upon keeping the United States at the top of the pyramid of world power. If the truth about the U.S. government's connections to Umbrella's bioweapons program were to get out, it would destabilize the world and remove America from the top of that hierarchy of power. Derek sets into motion a plan that will launch a bioterrorist attack and assassinate the president, thus preserving The Family's designs on power and stability.}}</ref>\n\n====Secret Service====\n=====Helena Harper=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Mayumi Sako]] (''RE6'')\n: Facial model by: [[Natasha Alam]]\nHelena Harper is an agent in the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Security Service]] (USSS) and the personal bodyguard of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Adam Benford.

At the time of the 2004 Terragrigia Panic, Raymond was an inexperienced cadet in the FBC. Injured by Veltro's Farfarello, he was rescued by the more experienced agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. Retreating back to the conference room where FBC Commissioner Morgan Lansdale was residing, Raymond stumbled upon a telephone conversation Lansdale was having with the Veltro leader, Jack Norman. Raymond became increasingly suspicious of his commanding officer, and knew that he was somehow involved with the bio-terrorist attack. However, he was unable to act on these suspicions, as the city was evacuated and destroyed soon after. At some point after this attack, Raymond became an informant for BSAA leader Clive R. O'Brian, operating as his mole within the FBC. O'Brian and Vester devised a plan to oust Lansdale as the architect of the Terragrigia attack through engineering the \"return\" of Veltro. Vester would pose as Jack Norman, and O'Brian used a mountain airbase to create the illusion that the terrorist group had resurfaced. In doing so, the two hoped to collect enough evidence to expose Lansdale. During the Queen Zenobia incident, O'Brian let slip that agents Jessica Sherawat and Chris Redfield were captured by Veltro aboard the Zenobia. Intercepting this information, Lansdale sent Vester and his partner Rachael to the ship to determine if the BSAA agents supposedly on board the vessel would pose any threat to him. Vester and O'Brian agreed to push forward the schedule of their plan. After boarding the ship, Vester, with and without his Veltro disguise, encountered Luciani and Valentine on the ship's bridge, making his presence known. Soon after, Agents Sherawat and Redfield boarded the vessel. Just as Raymond was about to reveal Lansdale's secrets to the group, Lansdale's mole, Jessica Sherawat, shot Raymond in the chest, causing him to fall from the balcony. Though Raymond was wearing a bulletproof vest and was unharmed by Jessica's shot, he faked his death while in her presence and whispered critical information about the conspiracy and her true identity. He later resurfaced and helped a gravely injured Luciani escape the sinking ship. Unbeknown to Parker, both Raymond and Jessica were agents of the pharmaceutical division of TRICELL, which had promoted the development of T-Abyss. The two met in a cafe in an unnamed European country, where Vester provided Sherawat with a sample of the T-Abyss.\n\n====Strategic Command====\n=====Bruce McGivern=====\n: Voiced by (English): Raj Ramayya (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroaki Hirata]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nWhen a large amount of a recently developed hybrid viral agent known as the \"T+G Virus\" was stolen from the Umbrella Pharmaceuticals Development Center in [[Paris]] by a former Umbrella researcher, Bruce McGivern was sent in by the U.S. government to retrieve the virus and neutralize the threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on board an Umbrella-owned luxury ocean liner, the ''Spencer Rain'', whose entire personnel on board have been infected with the T-virus stolen by the same former researcher, Morpheus D. Duvall, in September 2002. A member of the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]], McGivern is cocky and brash, and has a tendency to adopt a \"shoot first, ask questions later\" policy, with little regard for the consequences following his actions. This has often left him in many hostile situations, although in the end, he always somehow comes out on top. Confronted at the very beginning of the game by Duvall, he is saved by Chinese secret agent Fong Ling who throws a grenade at Morpheus (regardless of Bruce's life), seriously wounding the terrorist. He later works with her in order to stop Duvall's plan of unleashing the virus, bringing the fight to an underwater Umbrella secret laboratory which they ultimately destroy as Bruce kills a greatly mutated Duvall. At first at odds with Fong Ling, she and Bruce become closer as the story progresses, particularly after he saves her from an attempt on her life by her own government through the use of satellites armed with lasers. At the end of the game, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\n====MSS====\n=====Fong Ling=====\n: Voiced by (English): Claire O'Connor (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kae Araki]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nA Chinese intelligence agent employed by the [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]], Fong is infamous for her cold and stoic demeanor. Upon learning of her brother's involvement in anti-government activism, Fong arrested him. Following his arrest, Fong's brother was swiftly executed, although she never questioned the actions of her boss and remained absolutely loyal, stopping at nothing to accomplish her objectives. She is sent by the Chinese government to the Umbrella-owned luxury liner ''Spencer Rain'' to stop former Umbrella scientist Morpheus Duvall's plans and retrieve the sample of the virus he stole from an Umbrella's lab in Paris. Initially apathetic towards the presence of a rival operative, Bruce McGivern, going so far as to throw a grenade at Duvall who was holding him at gunpoint, she allies with him in order to stop Duvall. At some point, the Chinese government betrays her and attempts to kill her through the use of satellites armed with lasers. But Bruce saves her. Though greatly shaken by this event, she decides to complete her mission and to keep working for her employers afterward. And from that moment on, she becomes closer to Bruce. After killing Duvall and destroying an Umbrella secret laboratory underwater, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===NGOs===\nA [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) is an organization that is neither a part of a recognized government nor a conventional for-profit business.\n\n====TerraSave====\nTerraSave is a non-governmental human rights organization introduced in ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]''.\n\n=====Moira Burton=====\n: Voiced by (English): Marcella Lentz-Pope (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ayumi Fujimura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nMoira is the eldest daughter of STARS veteran, Barry Burton. In ''Resident Evil: Revelations 2'', Moira and her TerraSave co-workers including Claire Redfield are captured and taken to an abandoned prison facility supervised by Alex Wesker. Moira is a secondary character in Claire's portion of the game. She refuses to use firearms after accidentally wounding her sister with a handgun as a child. Instead, Moira uses tools, such as crowbars, to break open boxes and to attack enemies. She is estranged from her father. Eventually while fighting a mutated Neil Fisher, who betrayed the Terra Save group, Moira overcomes her fear of using a gun in order to save Claire if the player selects this option, which is canon. Moira is separated from Claire and saved by Evgeny, a Russian man who later chooses death once his daughter is dead. Moira then returns to save her father and friends from Alex Wesker, who is now fully mutated. Alex, however, lives on through possessing to some degree Natalia, who had become Moira's adoptive sister.\n\n=====Neil Fisher=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Eiji Hanawa (''Revelations 2'')\n\nNeil Fisher is a high-ranking member of TerraSave and senior officer of Claire Redfield. He was also involved with the organization's operations during the [[Resident Evil: Revelations|Terragrigia incident]], where he met and looked after a young Natalia Korda. However, unknown to other TerraSave members, Neil was affiliated with the FBC, primarily its director Morgan Lansdale. After it was disbanded during the events of ''Resident Evil: Revelations'', Neil plans to start another bioterrorist attack to justify the return of the FBC. To achieve this end, he contacts Alex Wesker and helps her organize the kidnapping of several members of TerraSave for experimentation with her T-Phobos virus. In return, he would receive a vial of Albert Wesker's Uroboros virus to start his bioterrorist attack. After helping Alex procure Natalia for the purposes of transferring her mind into the girl's body, she betrays Neil by injecting the virus into his body and sends him down to the lower levels of her tower, to fight Claire and Moira Burton. Mutating into a hulking beast, he is killed during their fight when shot at point-blank range in the head by either Claire or Moira (canonically the latter).\n\n====Neo-Umbrella====\n=====Carla Radames=====\n{{see also|Ada Wong}}\n\nCarla Radames is the primary antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''. She is the founder and leader of Neo-Umbrella, a terrorist organization that  strives on destroying  the current world order. Radames, a former government researcher, is the creator of the C-virus, a powerful mutagen capable of turning humans into capable and competent bio-organic weapons. Derek Simmons performs experiments on Carla which ultimately turn her into a clone of Ada Wong. While Carla possesses Ada's physical appearance and mannerisms, she still retains her original psyche. She also harbors a deep resentment towards Simmons, whom she believes stole her research and lifework. Radames personally oversees the bio-terror attacks in Europe, the United States, and China. She exacts revenge on Simmons by having her henchmen infect him with a potent dosage of the C-virus, which turns him into ravenous monster. She is fatally shot by a helicopter sent by the Family, but thanks to injecting herself with an enhanced C-virus, Radames mutated into a formless mass. She is eventually confronted and killed by Ada Wong.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 4 | quote = Carla Radames was responsible for the discovery of the C-Virus, and a close confidant of Derek C.

He chases after the intruder Ethan Winters inside a plantation mansion, or the \"Dulvey Haunted House\" as it is also referred to. Jack is a middle-aged man and a member of the Baker family who are victims of Eveline, and have captured Ethan's wife, Mia. The Bakers were thought to have vanished from the local community in Dulvey, Louisiana.\n\nNot long after the game was announced, Jack became known for his various one-liners such as \"Welcome to the family, son!\" heard in the various demo footage.<ref name=\"demo2\">{{cite news |last=Relph |first=Lauren |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-7-first-hour-true-ending-walkthrough |title=How to get the true ending in Resident Evil 7: First Hour demo for Xbox One and PC |work=Windows Central |date=2017-01-07 |accessdate=2017-01-22 }}</ref> Jack relentlessly pursues Ethan from area to area, being very strong and somehow appears to be nearly unstoppable. He uses a variety of weapons and can attack you even after being set ablaze when a car bursts into flames inside a garage. To prove to Ethan he is not human, he also takes his gun and seemingly dies after blowing his own head off, only to rise again and continue pursuing Ethan. Jack also murders a policeman who had come across Ethan after they entered the garage. During one such encounter, Ethan ultimately defeats Jack one last time after he has majorly mutated, but Jack later appears in a dream like scene as a normal man due to Ethan having used the serum to cure him. He still dies along with the rest of the Bakers, however, and is honored by Ethan when he says they were also victims of the tragedy that was Eveline. He returned as a major enemy in ''End of Zoe'' which is a [[downloadable content]] chapter that takes place after the main game.

They were responsible for the deaths of a local camera crew, but were really doing all of this to outsiders because Eveline had taken control of them, and before their infection, the Bakers were just an ordinary family. Marguerite was first shown in the various footage that was unveiled during 2016, including a clip featuring the scene where her family have the main protagonist Ethan Winters seated at the dinner table. Marguerite was more prominently featured in the ''Lantern'' demo, following Mia, Ethan's wife. She can summon insects to swarm together and attack Ethan, but he defeats her nonetheless. When she follows Mia, Mia must hide rather than face her in a battle.

Lucas later forces Clancy (a cameraman) and Ethan to navigate a series of areas filled with traps, and monsters, as he mocks their progress. Clancy is killed after engaging a trap, and Ethan watches a tape that reveals how his death occurred to ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate. Lucas survives the events because he is never faced in combat. He also appears in the downloadable content \"Banned Footage\" chapters, but these side quests predate the main story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-24-resident-evil-7-dlc-begins-rolling-out-next-week-on-ps4|title=Resident Evil 7 DLC begins rolling out next week on PS4|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref> However, a new sub-chapter entitled ''Not a Hero'' is set after the main game.

During some scenes, Alex is clearly seen in her mutated form as well, and controls the \"Afflicted\". Alex had captured Natalia to experiment on her, intending to transfer her own consciousness into Natalia's body. Regardless of the ending achieved by the player in ''Revelations 2'', good or bad, Alex manages, possibly to different degrees, to transfer her mind into Natalia's body and take over it. In the bonus episode \"Little Miss\", which takes place before Barry's arrival to the island, players assume control of Natalia and her mysterious evil twin as they look for the toy bear Lottie. This reveals Alex had already started her experience and her mind was present in Natalia's subconscious as the \"evil twin\".\n\n====Ark Thompson====\n: Voiced by: [[Patrick Harlan]] (''Resident Evil: Survivor'')\n\nArk Thompson is an acquaintance of Leon S.

She then begs for forgiveness, saying she will avenge her sister after she and Leon kill Simmons, and releases Deborah as she falls to her death into the darkness below. At the end of Leon and Helena's campaign, Helena visits Deborah's grave at a cemetery.\n\n====Ethan Winters====\n: Voiced by (English): Todd Soley (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]] (''RE7'')\nEthan is the protagonist of the game ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Ethan is an American systems engineer looking for his missing wife, Mia. Mia went missing over 3 years ago after she sent a video message to Ethan, talking about how much she was looking forward to coming home. Ethan then suddenly receives a disturbing video message and an email from Mia, so he tells an unknown friend that he is heading out to search for her in Dulvey, Louisiana. This leads him to a derelict plantation mansion, that also happens to be the home of the deranged Baker family, who have been driven insane due to being infected with the Mold from Eveline.\n\nAfter viewing a tape he finds regarding a camera crew being attacked in the same house, he soon finds his wife in a hidden area lying in a cell, but Mia acts peculiar as they look for a way out, and disappears. She then attacks Ethan with a kitchen knife. The ensuing chaos leads to Mia throwing Ethan through a wall. However, he manages to \"kill\" her using an ax and pistol. Eventually, she gets up, corners Ethan, and pins him to the wall by his hand with a screwdriver, then cuts off Ethan's pinned hand. Ethan knocks Mia out, and then suddenly, a man attacks Ethan and knocks him out, taking both Ethan and Mia back inside the house. Ethan's severed hand is reattached by a woman named Zoe (the only sane member of the Baker family) and then later, Ethan manages to become untied at the dinner table due to a police officer ringing a telephone, which distracted the Bakers, who were planning to torture him for refusing to eat with them. Ethan manages to fully mend his hand but learns that the Bakers cannot be \"killed\" very easily.\n\nMia, as it turns out, is also infected by Eveline, as is Zoe, and therefore not dead. Although Mia and Zoe have to find a way to escape as well. However, Zoe explains that they need to be cured first using a serum as they cannot leave until this is fulfilled. Ethan also encounters other abnormal monsters created by Eveline, such as the creatures called the Molded. But escaping the premises is made extremely difficult, as the Bakers relentlessly pursue him, and Ethan has to protect himself using whatever means he can find, so he can ultimately overcome each family member.\n\nEthan attempts to get in contact with a military group for his rescue while learning more about Eveline as an \"E-Series\" Bioweapon. After Ethan is assisted by the military group via chopper and finally puts a stop to Eveline, he and Mia are rescued by Chris Redfield, who is working with the newly reformed Umbrella Corporation. At the conclusion of the ''End of Zoe'' sub-chapter, Ethan talks to Zoe by phone and she finds out he kept his promise to send help, and Zoe is cured.\n\n====Evgeny Rebic====\n:Voiced by (English): Walter Rego (''Revelations 2'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ben Hiura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nRebic is an old [[Russians|Russian]] man Claire and Moira meet on the island they are trapped on in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. He is a miner who is not happy that they are potentially alerting the afflicted to his hideout; Moira ends up doing this by mistake while later spending time with him after her near death experience that resulted in her being away from Claire for 6 months. Although Evegeny is just a bit part character in the main game, he is the co-op partner of Moira in \"The Struggle\" bonus episode, and uses a rifle to shoot wild animals (for food) and kill enemies. He rescued Moira beneath all the debris that fell on her, but does not call her by that name afterwards, and he teaches her to hunt for herself, while they are putting up with one another's whining. He later learns his missing daughter named Irina is already dead and feeling unwell, Evgeny chooses to die in the underground, with Evgeny and Moira revealing their names to each other just before he passes. His body is eventually found by Barry and Natalia.\n\n====Eveline====\n: Voiced by (English): Patricia McNeely (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), Paula Rhodes (''RE7'' (Young))\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Yuri Tabata (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), [[Sumire Morohoshi]] (''RE7'' (Young))\n\nEveline is the main antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Considered as an \"E-Class\" B.O.W. codenamed \"E-001\", Eveline is a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] human created by a mysterious group called \"The Connections\" with the help from H.C.F (one of the companies owned by Albert Wesker) by fusing a Progenitor-enhanced fungus called Mutamycete into her genome during embryonic stage. Designed for the company's NEXBAS (Next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) initiative, the project was designed to create a B.O.W. capable of blending in with the population, neutralizing combatants without direct contact and converting enemies into allies. Ultimately, the project folded due to reservations regarding methodology and the difficultly of controlling the resultant product B.O.W., particularly in comparison to other projects. Eveline was the first successful E-Class prototype. She infected people using mold and fungus, allowing her to create a legion of people that she perceived as her \"family\", and thereby command and convert them into the \"Molded\". Due to the bioweapon's destructive abilities and mind control capabilities,  E-Class project materials were sought after by rival companies.  This state of affairs resulted in Mia Winters and Alan Droney, members of The Connections, travelling with Eveline upon a cargo ship bound for a facility in Central America.  When a hurricane hit the ship, Eveline became unstable.  Eveline infected Alan, and turned the crew into the Molded. Mia has no choice but to track Eveline and kill the former crew. Mia was helpless as Eveline killed Alan and subsequently infected her.  Mia attempted to send Ethan a second video message prior to the ship's destruction, wish him a happy life and urging him not to search for her.\n\nEveline and Mia were both later found and taken in by the Baker family, who happened upon the husk of the cargo ship in the Louisiana bayou. Eveline infected the Baker family within the month, on which put them under her control. Two years after, Eveline's mind and body were deteriorating rapidly due to lack of her medication and the degenerative effects of her condition, prompting her to demand the Bakers to add more people to her family by kidnapping or killing them. Zoe Baker was the only one not affected by Eveline's mind control while brother Lucas Baker was subsequently cured and pretended to work with his family, cognizant that Eveline was a threat.\n\nAfter Ethan arrived at the Baker family residence, he was helped by Zoe. When he finally learned of Eveline's origins, he used the equipment in the lab deep in the nearby Salt Mines to develop a necrotoxin using Eveline's DNA, which was capable of killing her. He succeeded on injecting Eveline with the necroxtoin, in the process learning that Eveline's true form is actually that of an old woman, demonstrating that rapid aging was an unintended byproduct of the project, as had been implied by internal project documents. After Eveline is injected with the necrotoxin, she mutated into a giant grotesque form as her powers spiral out of control. With the help from the reformed Umbrella Corporation and Chris Redfield, Ethan succeeded in fully killing Eveline before being rescued.\n\n====Jake Muller====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Troy Baker]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Namikawa]] (''RE6'')\n: Motion capture: [[Troy Baker]], Daniel Southworth (stunt double)\n\nJake Muller is the son of the Albert Wesker, a eugenicist, virologist and bioterrorist, who formerly worked for Umbrella. It is believed that Wesker was not aware of his sons existence, as Jake's Mother left shortly after being impregnated by him. Jake, later works as a freelance mercenary in order to support his mother, whom dies of an unknown chronic disease shortly after Jake receives money for her treatment. Jake was caught up in an act of bioterrorism while operating in anti-government operations in the fictional  Eastern European republic of Edonia. His mercenary comrades are infected with the C-virus, but Jake's specialized blood resists the infection. Soon after, he meets US government agent Sherry Birkin \u2013 whose father, William Birkin, was coincidentally Albert's research partner. Sherry and Jake take part in the subsequent battle between the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance and the mutated mercenaries.<ref name=\"Jake's story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/bio6/story_jake.html|title=CAPCOM\uff1aBIOHAZARD 6 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 - STORY|work=capcom.co.jp}}</ref> With his blood resistant to the downside-effects of mutagenic viruses like his father, Jake also inherited several of his father's signature abilities such as increased strength, speed, healing, and advanced combat skills. He demands a large sum of money from the BSAA, in order to sample a pint of his blood to be synthesize for vaccination to combat the C-virus. He and Sherry are captured by Carla Radames, a doppelg\u00e4nger of Ada Wong, and held captive in Lanshiang, China. They escape during the C-virus outbreak in the city six months later. Over the course of the story of ''RE6'', Jake comes to terms with both the knowledge of his father's actions and of his death at the hands of Chris Redfield three years earlier. After the ordeal, Jake starts a new life fighting BOWs in an underdeveloped country with his real identity covered up by the BSAA.\n\n====Joe Baker====\n:Voiced by (English): Gage Maverik (''RE7'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[K\u014dsei Hirota]] (''RE7'')\nJoe Baker is the main protagonist in the ''End of Zoe'' [[downloadable content]] chapter, for ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-biohazards-not-a-hero-end-of-zoe-d/1100-6454102/|title=Resident Evil 7: Biohazard's Not A Hero, End Of Zoe DLC Further Detailed With New Trailer|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=17 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The brother of Jack Baker, he lives in the nearby swamplands near the Baker estate, though is isolated from the rest of the family and unaffected by Eveline's control. During the chapter, Joe discovers his niece, Zoe, shortly after the events of the main game and tries to find a cure to free her from Eveline's influence. To do so, he battles against the remnants of the molded creatures created by the Bakers and a mysterious creature chasing after them, later revealed to be a resurrected Jack. Joe ultimately kills his brother and is able to cure Zoe, after which they are found and extracted by the Umbrella Corps. Although he can use firearms, Joe mostly fights with his bare hands, though later acquires an Umbrella Corps glove to increase his strength prior to his final battle with Jack.\n\n====Katherine Warren====\nKatherine Warren is the daughter of Raccoon City's Mayor, Michael Warren. Left behind in Raccoon City by her father, she is left in the care of Chief Brian Irons. Driven insane by the outbreak, Irons instead murders Katherine, planning to stuff her body and keep it as part of his taxidermy collection. Warren's body appears in both versions of ''Resident Evil 2'' and its retelling ''The Darkside Chronicles''. She appears in the remake's ''Ghost Survivors'' DLC story \"Runaway\", which takes place outside of the main series canon.<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3546471/capcom-offers-details-resident-evil-2-dlc-ghost-survivors/</ref>\n\n====Lisa Trevor====\n{{Nihongo|Lisa Trevor|\u30ea\u30b5\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc|Risa Torev\u0101}} is a character and enemy in the remake of ''Resident Evil'' and ''The Umbrella Chronicles''.<ref>Damien Waples, \"The Infected: Lisa Trevor,\" ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Prima's Official Game Guide'' (Roseville: Random House, Inc., 2007), 27.</ref> Lisa Trevor is the daughter of George Trevor, the architect behind Ozwell Spencer's Arklay Mansion and the Queen Zenobia cruiser, and his wife Jessica.

A member of an unnamed organization, possibly a former rival of Umbrella, Mia was tasked with escorting a bio-weapon called Eveline to another facility. However, the tanker is attacked and crashes in a [[Louisiana]]n swamp. Found by the Baker family, Eveline infects them, planning to start a family of its own, hence the reason Mia and the Bakers were its earliest known victims. However, Mia also briefly serves as an antagonist due to being infected by Eveline, causing her to attack her husband shortly after he found her in a holding cell beneath the house. Mia is seemingly \"killed\" by her husband in self-defense after having an axe plunged into her neck, but despite this, she isn't truly dead because of Eveline.\n\nBoth Mia and Ethan are taken by Jack Baker, and Mia recovers off screen. From that point on, Mia works with a woman called Zoe (who is revealed to be a Baker) and Ethan tries to save them by receiving hints from Zoe when she telephones him, while Ethan is having to deal with constant attacks perpetrated by the other Bakers. In some parts of the game, Mia is playable too, but sometimes she has to hide rather than confront enemies. After using a cure created by Zoe to kill Jack, Ethan must use the remaining vial to save either Mia or Zoe. Depending on a choice made by the player, Ethan can either cure Mia and attempt to escape with her, or choose Zoe, leaving her behind. After Ethan and the person he chose to save is attacked, the player once again takes control of Mia, searching the tanker for him. After freeing him, Mia will start to become possessed by Eveline again. Depending on the player's earlier decision, Mia will separate herself from Ethan to save him or allow Eveline to take control of her, forcing Ethan to kill her. If the former plays out, she will be recovered by [[Umbrella Corps]] mercenaries, reuniting with Ethan as the game ends.\n\n====Natalia Korda====\n: Voiced by (English): Gabriella Pastore (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (''Revelations 2'')\nA young girl who is a playable character in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. Natalia accompanies [[Barry Burton]] immediately when he arrives on an island to search for his missing daughter, Moira. Natalia explains that she is an orphan due to the death of her parents. Natalia can find items that are hidden, detect the presence of invisible or off-screen enemies (indicated by a glowing effect) and go through small passageways to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Since Natalia cannot use any firearms, she can pick up bricks to throw at any monsters, but often has to evade the monsters.\n\nAlex Wesker targets Natalia throughout the course of the plot in order to [[mind uploading|mind transfer herself]] into her, believing she is not \"true\" like she is. Alex (when in a grotesque form near the climax of the game), causes Natalia's fear to reach its highest on her wrist bracelet, but it is not explained what happens to Natalia. In a prequel segment, '''Dark Natalia''' joined Natalia to help find \"Lottie\", Natalia's beloved teddy bear, and she then begins her association with Barry, now having the ability to see any monsters that Barry cannot always notice. In the true ending, it was revealed prior to Alex mutating into her third and final form that she was able to transfer her mind into Natalia's body up until the young girl's body had been fully taken over by Alex, in 2013. Barry adopts Natalia after Alex is killed, but she is seen reading a piece by [[Franz Kafka]] then smiling, so Alex succeeded to some degree.\n\n====Robert Kendo====\n:Voiced by (English): Gary Krawford (RE2), Jason C. Miller (DC)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Hideki Tanaka (REmake 2)\nRobert Kendo is the owner of a gun store in Raccoon City. He and his brother Joseph are responsible for creating the Samurai Edge pistols used by S.T.A.R.S. members.  In the original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', he briefly appears in the opening of Scenario A, allowing the player to stay in his gunshop for protection. However, zombies soon break in and devour Kendo, leaving a weapon for the player to pick up. In the remake, Robert confronts Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong as they attempt to pass through the shop to reach the sewers. It's also revealed he has a daughter, Emma, who he tries to protect from the outbreak. However, she is infected and Robert is forced to kill her. Kendo also appears in the game's ''The Ghost Survivors'' DLC as the player character in \"No Time to Mourn\". A non-canonical scenario, it follows him as he attempts to escape Raccoon City.<ref>https://www.altchar.com/games-news/586950/resident-evil-2-remake-will-get-three-free-dlc-stories</ref><ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/resident-evil-2-the-ghost-survivors-detailed-ahead-of-the-free-dlcs-launch-this-friday/</ref> He also appears in ''The Darkside Chronicles'', though is killed offscreen before he encounters either Leon or Claire.\n\n====Steve Burnside====\n: Voiced by: Bill Houston (''Code Veronica''), [[Sam Riegel]] (''The Darkside Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Steve Burnside|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|Sut\u012bbu B\u0101nsaido}} is [[Claire Redfield]]'s partner in the game ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. Steve was imprisoned in the Rockfort Island's facility alongside his father, a former Umbrella employee. He escapes from his cell during the viral outbreak. At first, Steve is hesitant to trust Claire and only cooperates with her reluctantly, but later becomes more open and attached to her after he is forced to kill his own father, who has become a zombie during the outbreak. Steve and Claire eventually end up in Umbrella's Antarctic Facility, where he is captured by Alexia and used as a test subject for the T-Veronica virus. Claire meets a chained Steve, who mutates into a monster and attacks Claire; in this form, he is nearly invulnerable to damage, and wields a giant, ceremonial axe. While running from Steve, Claire is attacked by one of Alexia's tentacles. Steve, seeing this, regains control of his mind and cuts the tentacle apart, freeing Claire. In retaliation, Alexia strikes him with one of the tentacles, inflicting a mortal wound. His failing body finally rejects the mutation, and he changes back. He dies in Claire's arms, just after professing his love to her. He was later taken by Albert Wesker due to the T-Veronica virus in his body, and also hinted that he might come back to life. In ''The Darkside Chronicles'' it is revealed that Wesker contacted the drug baron Javier Hidalgo and took a sample of T-Veronica from Steve's corpse in order to sell the virus for Hidalgo's ailing daughter, Manuela.\n\n====Zoe Baker====\n: Voiced by (English): Giselle Gilbert (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016b Kobayashi]] (''RE7'')\n: Face model: [[Ananda Jacobs]] (''RE7'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anandajacobs.com/about|title=About \u2014 Ananda Jacobs|website=anandajacobs.com|accessdate=June 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZoe is the youngest member of the Baker family in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' set in 2017, and despite being infected by Eveline like the rest of her family, Zoe is somewhat normal, and serves as a supporting character. Zoe gets in contact with Ethan Winters by telephone several times, asking Ethan if \"Daddy\" gave him a hard time, as well as giving him tips on how to advance through the area. She was also the person who attached Ethan's severed hand back on after his wife Mia had cut it off, when she temporarily turned crazy. Working alongside of Mia thereafter, Zoe explains to Ethan that due to being infected, a serum needs to be given to each of them before they can escape too. Unfortunately, Ethan has to use one of the two vials to stop the heavily mutated Jack Baker when he returned yet again to try to finish off Ethan, leaving only one dosage remaining. The player can then choose to cure either Mia or Zoe, leading to an alternate story playing out: If Mia is selected, Zoe stays behind to die with the rest of her family, displaying anger over the fact that she felt she never had a future. It is unknown if she is alive during this path, but she is seen during Ethan and Jack's conversation scene. If Zoe is chosen to be cured, she and Ethan try to escape. However, they are both attacked by Eveline, during which Zoe is engulfed by her, killing her.\n\nIn the ''Daughters'' [[downloadable content]] sub-chapter, players control Zoe Baker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameranx.com/features/id/93190/article/resident-evil-7-daughters-dlc-how-to-unlock-all-the-endings/ |title=Resident Evil 7: Daughters DLC {{!}} How to Unlock All The Endings |website=gameranx.com}}</ref> just as her father rescues Mia and Eveline out in the swamp. Jack brings Eveline into their home during stormy weather to rest up in Lucas' bedroom, but as Zoe is about to change her wet clothes, Eveline looks up, saying, \"They're mine now!\" and then runs off, laughing maniacally. The power goes out at the same time. Eveline has begun converting the Bakers to her cause, as Zoe finds her mother has gone crazy and attempts to attack her. Jack tries to hold off Marguerite and tells Zoe to get rope from the garage, but by the time she comes back upstairs with it, Jack has already turned, trying to drown Marguerite in the bathtub, and Zoe has to escape through the recreation room as he gives chase. She also witnesses her father dragging Lucas along a hallway. This canonical prequel chapter is strategy based, as Zoe must flee from rather than fight her parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.primagames.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/tips/resident-evil-7-how-get-true-ending-daughters-dlc-tape|title=Resident Evil 7 - How to Get the True Ending of the Daughters DLC Tape|website=Prima Games}}</ref> There's two possible endings: Zoe can either enter the trailer after finding out the passcode number from the attic to learn of the location of a key item, and finds Mia in her trailer, as well as an important note she wrote, or she can use the car keys given to her by her mother, which results in a poor ending due to the player choosing the \"wrong path\" for Zoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/02/resident-evil-7-walkthrough-how-to-get-best-ending-banned-footage-vol-2/|title=Resident Evil 7 Daughters walkthrough: how to get the best ending in Banned Footage Vol 2 DLC|date=2 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHer uncle Joe finds Zoe and two Umbrella operatives who claim they are trying to save her.

Out in the swamp, he has to get the other half, and ultimately kill his brother, the very much alive, but horribly mutated Jack.
