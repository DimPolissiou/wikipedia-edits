Political power grows from conquering land; however, cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\".<ref>Howe, 45</ref> Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\".<ref>Howe, 62</ref> European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the [[world systems theory]]. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of areas of high income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of [[Geopolitics|geo-politics]] have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Vladimir Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\".<ref name=Gilmartin2009/>{{rp|116}} This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in the modern era.

Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. [[Robert J. C.

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.<ref name=\"Painter & Jeffrey\"/>{{rp|170\u201375}} The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance.

In [[ancient China]], [[Tianxia]] denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the [[Emperor]] by universal and well-defined principles of order.

According to Bassett, \"[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground. Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy\"<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J. 1994\"/> but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them.\n\n[[File:Siege of Belgrade (N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r) 1456.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Ottoman wars in Europe]]]]\nImperialism in ancient times is clear in the history of China and in the history of western Asia and the Mediterranean\u2014an unending succession of empires. The tyrannical empire of the Assyrians was replaced (6th\u20134th century BCE) by that of the Persians, in strong contrast to the Assyrian in its liberal treatment of subjected peoples, assuring it long duration. It eventually gave way to the imperialism of Greece. When Greek imperialism reached an apex under Alexander the Great (356\u2013323 BCE), a union of the eastern Mediterranean with western Asia was achieved. But the cosmopolis, in which all citizens of the world would live harmoniously together in equality, remained a dream of Alexander. It was partially realized when the Romans built their empire from Britain to Egypt.\n\nThe concept of [[cultural imperialism]] refers to the cultural influence of one dominant culture over others, i.e. a form of [[soft power]], which changes the moral, cultural, and societal [[worldview]] of the subordinate country. This means more than just \"foreign\" music, television or film becoming popular with young people; rather that a populace changes its own expectations of life, desiring for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera [[Dallas (1978 TV series)#Dallas and the Cold War|Dallas during the Cold War]] changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled [[South Korea]]n drama series in [[North Korea]]. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.\n\nImperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics{{which|date=December 2014}}, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.<ref name=\"IESS\">\"Imperialism.\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd edition.</ref>\n\n===Age of Imperialism===\n{{Main|International relations, 1648\u20131814|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\nThe Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1760, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world.<ref>[https://archive.org/search.php?query=atlas%20world%20history%20haywood John Haywood, ''Atlas of world history'' (1997)]</ref> 19th century episodes included the \"[[Scramble for Africa]].\"<ref>See Stephen Howe, ed., ''The New Imperial Histories Reader'' (2009) [https://h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32358 online review].</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Scramble for Africa|Africa]], divided into colonies under multiple European empires, c. 1913 {{Legend|#f7fab2|Belgium}}{{Legend|#bbfdd9|Germany}}{{Legend|#eaaff7|Spain}}{{Legend|#b6e3fc|France}}{{Legend|#fbc5c0|Great Britain}}{{Legend|#d2f89b|Italy}}{{Legend|#c0a6f2|Portugal}}]]\n\nIn the 1970s British historians [[John Andrew Gallagher|John Gallagher]] (1919\u20131980) and [[Ronald Robinson]] (1920\u20131999) argued that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region.

At first planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items. Apart from the [[Indian subcontinent]], this was seldom true. By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector. Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India, especially [[Mughal Bengal]], but not from most of the rest of its empire. The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise. However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable.

European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly. By the 1880s, the [[machine gun]] had become a reliable battlefield weapon. This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879).<ref name=\"Adas 2008 54-58\"/> Some exceptions of armies that managed to get nearly on par with the European expeditions and standards include the Ethiopian armies at the [[Battle of Adwa]], the Chinese [[Ever Victorious Army]] and the Japanese [[Imperial Army of Japan]], but these still relied heavily on weapon imports from Europe and often on European military advisors and adventurers.\n\n==Theories of imperialism==\nAnglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the British experience of Empire. The term ''imperialism'' was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. Supporters of \"imperialism\" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] quickly appropriated the concept. For some,{{Who|date=September 2016}} imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with greed.\n\n[[John A. Hobson]], A leading English Liberal, developed a highly influential interpretation of ''Imperialism: A Study'' (1902) that expanded on his belief that free enterprise had a negative impact on the majority of the population. In ''Imperialism'' he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home. It was invested abroad because of lower wages paid to the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages. So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise. Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living. By the 1970s, historians such as David K. Fieldhouse<ref name=Fieldhouse1961>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0289.1961.tb00045.x|title = 'Imperialism': An Historiographical Revision|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 187\u2013209|year = 1961|last1 = Fieldhouse|first1 = D.

However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'' (1916). Lenin portrayed [[Theory of Imperialism|Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition]] that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism, which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets. Lenin's treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the collapse of communism in 1989\u201391.<ref>Tony Brewer, ''Marxist theories of imperialism: a critical survey'' (2002)</ref>\n\nSome theoreticians on the non-Communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and, in some accounts, to the [[Crusades]]. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect\u2014among other shifts in sensibility\u2014a growing unease, even great distaste, with the pervasiveness of such power, specifically, Western power.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5923.2008.00252.x|title = Words for Scholars: The Semantics of \"Imperialism\"|journal = Journal of the Historical Society|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages = 395\u2013433|year = 2008|last1 = Proudman|first1 = Mark F.}}</ref><ref name=Fieldhouse1961/>\n\nHistorians and political theorists have long debated the correlation between class and imperialism.

While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the [[Interwar period|interwar years]]. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/03086530601143388|title = Capitalism, Aristocracy and Empire: Some 'Classical' Theories of Imperialism Revisited|journal = The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History|volume = 35|pages = 25\u201347|year = 2007|last1 = Cain|first1 = P.

The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and thus validated their domination.

Across the three major waves of [[European colonialism]] (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), [[environmental determinism]] served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, [[orientalism]] and tropicality.\n\nSome geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into [[climate zone|climatic zones]]. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic [[temperate climate]] produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.

However, in the 1850s, [[Perry Expedition|military pressure from the United States]] and other world powers coerced Japan to open itself to the global market, resulting in an end to the country's isolation. A [[Bakumatsu|period of conflicts and political revolutions]] followed due to socioeconomic uncertainty, ending in 1868 with the reunification of political power under the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. This sparked a period of rapid [[industrialization]] driven in part by a Japanese desire for self-sufficiency. By the early 1900s, Japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established European power as it defeated Russia.<ref>Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present'' (2013), pp 114-25.</ref>\n\nDespite its rising population and increasingly industrialized economy, Japan had relatively little territory and lacked significant natural resources. As a result, the country turned to imperialism and [[expansionism]] in part as a means of compensating for these shortcomings, adopting the national motto ''\"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei]]\"'' (\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175, \"Enrich the state, strengthen the military\").<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Joseph, ed.|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of War: Social Science Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idw0DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA430|year=2016|publisher=SAGE|page=430|isbn=9781483359885}}</ref>\n\nAnd Japan was eager to take every opportunity. In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the [[Republic of Ezo]] to incorporate definitely the island of [[Hokkaido]] to Japan. For centuries, Japan viewed the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as one of its provinces. In 1871 the [[Mudan incident]] happened: [[Paiwan people|Taiwanese aborigines]] murdered 54 [[Ryukyuan people|Ry\u016bky\u016ban]] sailors that had their ship shipwrecked. At that time the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were claimed by both [[Qing China]] and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens. They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain]] was declared, and in 1874 a [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|retaliatory incursion to Taiwan]] was sent, which was a success. The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese in the [[Formosa Expedition]] of 1867. Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series. Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures, but in 1879 it finally annexed the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese, but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed, ambushed and 250 of their men were killed; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan, and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan. Eventually, the spoils for winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894 included [[Taiwan]].<ref>S.C.M. Paine, ''The Japanese Empire: Grand Strategy from the Meiji Restoration to the Pacific War'' (2017) pp 15-48.</ref>\n\nIn 1875 Japan took its first operation against [[Kingdom of Joseon|Joseon Korea]], another territory that for centuries it coveted; the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] made Korea open to international trade. [[Korea]] was annexed in 1910. As a result of winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, Japan took part of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] from Russia. Precisely, the victory against the [[Russian Empire]] shook the world: never before an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat. Japan's victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for [[Decolonization]]. During [[World War I]], Japan took German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]], and kept the islands as League of nations mandates. At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area. By the '30s, economic depression, urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the Allied powers made Japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance. Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance. In 1931 Japan took [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]] from China. International reactions condemned this move, but Japan's already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on.<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) pp 3-54.</ref>\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937.]]\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China. Also, in 1938-1939 Japan made an attempt to seize the territory of Soviet Russia and Mongolia, but suffered a serious defeats (see [[Battle of Lake Khasan]], [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]]). By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced. Thus a military move to gain access to them was needed, and so Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], bringing the United States to World War II. Using its superior technological advances in [[naval aviation]] and its modern doctrines of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[naval warfare]], Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history. By 1942 Japan had conquered much of East Asia and the Pacific, including the east of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of [[New Guinea]] and many islands of the Pacific Ocean. Just as Japan's late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European \"[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]\". This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests, especially in Indonesia. However, the United States had a vastly stronger military and industrial base and defeated Japan, stripping it of conquests and returning its settlers back to Japan.<ref>Ramon H. Myers and Mark R.

In 1453, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] besieged the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], resulting in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] after 1,500 years of Roman rule, thereafter making it the capital of the empire. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of [[Southeast Europe]], [[Western Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] to escape persecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained [[Provinces of the Ottoman Empire|32 provinces]] and numerous [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal states]]. Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.<ref>Jane Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 1516\u20131800'' (2008).</ref>\n\nWith [[Constantinople]] as its capital and control of lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean basin]], the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military setbacks]] against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|declined]] in its ability to remain sovereign against competing powers in the late 19th century.\n\nThe collapse of the Ottoman Empire was accelerated by the intervention of the great powers. In 1821-1829 the Greeks in their struggle for independence were assisted by the Russian Empire, Great Britain, and the Kingdom of France (see [[Greek War of Independence]]). \nLater in fact, the Ottoman Empire could exist only in the conditions of acute rivalry of the great powers. Russia's attempt to negotiate with Britain on the partition of the Ottoman Empire failed. Britain after the conclusion of [[Treaty of Balta Liman]] in 1838 was interested in preserving the Ottoman Empire and in [[Crimean war]] 1853\u20131856, the great powers of Britain and France opposed Russia, as a result of the Ottoman Empire existed until 1922. As result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]], Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro gained independence in the European part of the Empire.\n\nThe empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|dissolved]] in the aftermath of its defeat in the [[First World War]]. At the same time, Turkey itself could barely avoid the fate of being divided into colonies of great powers, see [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. The result was the [[Turkish War of Independence]], when Kemalist forces backed by Soviet Russia established the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The residue was the new state of [[Turkey]] in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern [[Balkan]] and [[Middle East]]ern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.<ref>Caroline Finkel, (2005).

This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]] took place after Polish nobility from the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] wrote the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]]. The war resulted in eastern [[Poland]] being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918. The southern campaigns involved a series of [[Russo-Persian Wars]], which began with the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], resulting in the acquisition of [[Georgia (country)]] as a protectorate. Between 1800 and 1864, Imperial armies invaded south in the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]], the [[Murid War]], and the [[Russo-Circassian War]]. This last conflict led to the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]] from their lands. The [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] over the [[Khanate of Sibir]] took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Koryaks]], the [[Itelmens]], [[Mansi people]] and the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today. The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed [[Cossacks]] hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate [[Sosloviye]] in the late 18th century. Cossacks were then used in Imperial Russian campaigns against other tribes.<ref>Willard Sunderland, \"An Empire of Peasants. Empire-Building, Interethnic Interaction, and Ethnic Stereotyping in the Rural World of the Russian Empire, 1800\u20131850s.\" ''Imperial Russia. New histories for the Empire'' (1998): 174\u2013198.</ref>\n\nBut it would be a strong simplification to reduce expansion of Russia only to military conquests. The reunification of Ukraine with Russia took place in 1654, when Polish rule brought the population of Ukraine to revolts (see [[Pereyaslav Council]]). Another example is Georgia's accession to Russia in 1783. Given Georgia's history of invasions from the south, an alliance with Russia may have been seen as the only way to discourage or resist Persian and Ottoman aggression, while also establishing a link to Western Europe (see [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]). Russia's support helped establish independent Mongolia (independent from China) (see [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911]]).\n\n[[Bolshevik]] leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/crnq/index.htm |author=V.I.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism was the highest stage of]] [[capitalism]].

In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders.

Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the [[Age of Discovery]], such as those undertaken by [[Christopher Columbus]], Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the [[Caribbean basin]]. Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of ''[[Conquistador]]s'', which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies.\n\n==== Imperialism in the Caribbean basin ====\n[[File:Spanish Caribbean Islands in the American Viceroyalties 1600.png|thumb|upright=2|Spanish colonies and territories in the Caribbean basin (c. 1490 \u2013 c. 1660)]]\nIn congruence with the colonialist activities of competing European imperial powers throughout the 15th \u2013 19th centuries, the Spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power. The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism. Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Inca Empire]], Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation's imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin.\n\nEchoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain's European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin.\n\nWhile leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the [[Ta\u00edno|Ta\u03afno]] populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system during the 16th\u201317th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.\n\n==== Scholarly debate and controversy ====\nThe scope and scale of Spanish participation in imperialism within the Caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians. A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism. Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists.\n\nAmong historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th\u201319th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically-driven form of imperialism. Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism.\n\nFurther divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought. Noteworthy examples include [[cultural imperialism]], whereby proponents such as John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Modammadi define imperialism as ''\"...the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one.\"''<ref>Downing, John; Ali Mohammadi; Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). ''Questioning the media: a critical introduction'' (2, illustrated ed.). Sage. p. 482. {{ISBN|978-0-8039-7197-4}}.</ref> Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force.\" Moreover, colonialism is understood as ''\"...the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners.\"''<ref>Downing; Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). p. 482.</ref>\n\nIn spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians, within the context of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean basin during the colonial era, imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism. In this context, colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives.\n\n===Sweden===\n\n{{main|Swedish overseas colonies}}\n\n{{sectstub|date=April 2020}}\n=== Venezuela ===\n[[File:Guayana_Esequiba_(zona_completa).png|thumb|Striped, the [[Guayana Esequiba]] area claimed by Venezuela|270x270px]]\n\n==== Republic of Venezuela ====\nVenezuela has had a history of expansionist actions to add to its territory and regional influence.

Political power grows from conquering land; however, cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\".<ref>Howe, 45</ref> Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\".<ref>Howe, 62</ref> European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the [[world systems theory]]. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of areas of high income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of [[Geopolitics|geo-politics]] have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Vladimir Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\".<ref name=Gilmartin2009/>{{rp|116}} This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in the modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.\n\n[[File:Roubaud.

Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. [[Robert J. C.

Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled.

In [[ancient China]], [[Tianxia]] denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the [[Emperor]] by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe \"[[barbarians]]\". Tianxia's idea of hierarchy gave [[Chinese people|Chinese]] a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace. [[J. A. Hobson]] identifies this justification on general grounds as: \"It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest 'social efficiency'\".<ref>Hobson, J.A. \"Imperialism: a study.\" Cosimo, Inc., 2005. p. 154</ref> Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. [[Friedrich Ratzel]] believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. [[Halford Mackinder]] felt that [[Great Britain]] needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.<ref name=Gilmartin2009/> The purportedly scientific nature of \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. Under this doctrine, the French politician Jules Ferry could declare in 1883 that \"Superior races have a right, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Imperialism|publisher=D.C.

According to Bassett, \"[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground. Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy\"<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J. 1994\"/> but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them.\n\n[[File:Siege of Belgrade (N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r) 1456.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Ottoman wars in Europe]]]]\nImperialism in ancient times is clear in the history of China and in the history of western Asia and the Mediterranean\u2014an unending succession of empires. The tyrannical empire of the Assyrians was replaced (6th\u20134th century BCE) by that of the Persians, in strong contrast to the Assyrian in its liberal treatment of subjected peoples, assuring it long duration. It eventually gave way to the imperialism of Greece. When Greek imperialism reached an apex under Alexander the Great (356\u2013323 BCE), a union of the eastern Mediterranean with western Asia was achieved. But the cosmopolis, in which all citizens of the world would live harmoniously together in equality, remained a dream of Alexander. It was partially realized when the Romans built their empire from Britain to Egypt.\n\nThe concept of [[cultural imperialism]] refers to the cultural influence of one dominant culture over others, i.e. a form of [[soft power]], which changes the moral, cultural, and societal [[worldview]] of the subordinate country. This means more than just \"foreign\" music, television or film becoming popular with young people; rather that a populace changes its own expectations of life, desiring for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera [[Dallas (1978 TV series)#Dallas and the Cold War|Dallas during the Cold War]] changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled [[South Korea]]n drama series in [[North Korea]]. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.\n\nImperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics{{which|date=December 2014}}, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.<ref name=\"IESS\">\"Imperialism.\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd edition.</ref>\n\n===Age of Imperialism===\n{{Main|International relations, 1648\u20131814|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\nThe Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1760, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world.<ref>[https://archive.org/search.php?query=atlas%20world%20history%20haywood John Haywood, ''Atlas of world history'' (1997)]</ref> 19th century episodes included the \"[[Scramble for Africa]].\"<ref>See Stephen Howe, ed., ''The New Imperial Histories Reader'' (2009) [https://h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32358 online review].</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Scramble for Africa|Africa]], divided into colonies under multiple European empires, c. 1913 {{Legend|#f7fab2|Belgium}}{{Legend|#bbfdd9|Germany}}{{Legend|#eaaff7|Spain}}{{Legend|#b6e3fc|France}}{{Legend|#fbc5c0|Great Britain}}{{Legend|#d2f89b|Italy}}{{Legend|#c0a6f2|Portugal}}]]\n\nIn the 1970s British historians [[John Andrew Gallagher|John Gallagher]] (1919\u20131980) and [[Ronald Robinson]] (1920\u20131999) argued that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region.

At first planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items. Apart from the [[Indian subcontinent]], this was seldom true. By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector. Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India, especially [[Mughal Bengal]], but not from most of the rest of its empire. The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise. However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable. The Philippines cost the United States much more than expected because of military action against rebels.<ref name=\"Hale\"/>{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\nBecause of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before [[World War I]], making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Christopher|first= A.J.|title= Patterns of British Overseas Investment in Land|journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1985|volume= 10|series= New Series|issue= 4|pages= 452\u201366|doi= 10.2307/621891|jstor= 621891}}<!--|accessdate= November 14, 2012--></ref>\n\nEurope's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means.

European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly. By the 1880s, the [[machine gun]] had become a reliable battlefield weapon. This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879).<ref name=\"Adas 2008 54-58\"/> Some exceptions of armies that managed to get nearly on par with the European expeditions and standards include the Ethiopian armies at the [[Battle of Adwa]], the Chinese [[Ever Victorious Army]] and the Japanese [[Imperial Army of Japan]], but these still relied heavily on weapon imports from Europe and often on European military advisors and adventurers.\n\n==Theories of imperialism==\nAnglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the British experience of Empire. The term ''imperialism'' was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. Supporters of \"imperialism\" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] quickly appropriated the concept. For some,{{Who|date=September 2016}} imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.\n\n[[John A. Hobson]], A leading English Liberal, developed a highly influential interpretation of ''Imperialism: A Study'' (1902) that expanded on his belief that free enterprise capitalism had a negative impact on the majority of the population. In ''Imperialism'' he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home. It was invested abroad because of lower wages paid to the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages. So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise. Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living. By the 1970s, historians such as David K. Fieldhouse<ref name=Fieldhouse1961>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0289.1961.tb00045.x|title = 'Imperialism': An Historiographical Revision|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 187\u2013209|year = 1961|last1 = Fieldhouse|first1 = D.

However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'' (1916). Lenin portrayed [[Theory of Imperialism|Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition]] that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism, which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets. Lenin's treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the collapse of communism in 1989\u201391.<ref>Tony Brewer, ''Marxist theories of imperialism: a critical survey'' (2002)</ref>\n\nSome theoreticians on the non-Communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and, in some accounts, to the [[Crusades]]. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.

Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/03086530601143388|title = Capitalism, Aristocracy and Empire: Some 'Classical' Theories of Imperialism Revisited|journal = The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History|volume = 35|pages = 25\u201347|year = 2007|last1 = Cain|first1 = P.

The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and thus validated their domination. For example, the [[Western world]] saw people living in tropical environments as \"less civilized\", therefore justifying colonial control as a [[civilizing mission]]. Across the three major waves of [[European colonialism]] (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), [[environmental determinism]] served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, [[orientalism]] and tropicality.\n\nSome geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into [[climate zone|climatic zones]]. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic [[temperate climate]] produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat. Similarly, orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location.<ref>\nCompare: {{harvnb|Gilmartin|2009}}, \"[...] the practice of colonialism was legitimized by geographical theories such as environmental determinism.\"</ref>\n\n==Imperialism by country==\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n\n{{main|Austro-Hungarian Empire}}\n\n{{sectstub|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Belgium===\n\n{{main|Belgian Empire}}\n\n{{sectstub|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Brazil===\n\n{{main|Empire of Brazil}}\n=== Britain ===\n{{main|Historiography of the British Empire|British Empire}}\n[[File:Tipu Sultan, Indian warrior Emperor of Mysore.gif|thumb|upright|[[Tipu Sultan|Tipu]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Sultan of Mysore]], an ally  of [[Napoleone Bonaparte]], confronted [[Presidency armies|British East India Company forces]] at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Siege of Srirangapatna]], where he was killed.]]\n[[File:Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg|thumb|The end result of the [[Boer Wars]] was the annexation of the [[Boer Republics]] to the British Empire in 1902.]]\n\n'''England'''<br>\nEngland's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the 16th century as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] began in the 1530s.

But British power was fading, as the reunited [[Germany|German state founded by the Kingdom of Prussia]] posed a growing threat to Britain's dominance. As of 1913, Britain was the world's fourth economy, behind the U.S, Russia and Germany.\n\n[[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919-1921 led to the \u0441reation of the Irish Free State.

However, this period was also the one of the emergence of independence movements based on nationalism and new experiences the colonists had gained in the war.\n\n[[World War II]] decisively weakened Britain's position in the world, especially financially.

However, in the 1850s, [[Perry Expedition|military pressure from the United States]] and other world powers coerced Japan to open itself to the global market, resulting in an end to the country's isolation. A [[Bakumatsu|period of conflicts and political revolutions]] followed due to socioeconomic uncertainty, ending in 1868 with the reunification of political power under the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. This sparked a period of rapid [[industrialization]] driven in part by a Japanese desire for self-sufficiency. By the early 1900s, Japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established European power as it defeated Russia.<ref>Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present'' (2013), pp 114-25.</ref>\n\nDespite its rising population and increasingly industrialized economy, Japan had relatively little territory and lacked significant natural resources.

In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the [[Republic of Ezo]] to incorporate definitely the island of [[Hokkaido]] to Japan. For centuries, Japan viewed the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as one of its provinces. In 1871 the [[Mudan incident]] happened: [[Paiwan people|Taiwanese aborigines]] murdered 54 [[Ryukyuan people|Ry\u016bky\u016ban]] sailors that had their ship shipwrecked. At that time the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were claimed by both [[Qing China]] and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens. They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain]] was declared, and in 1874 a [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|retaliatory incursion to Taiwan]] was sent, which was a success. The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese in the [[Formosa Expedition]] of 1867. Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series. Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures, but in 1879 it finally annexed the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese, but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed, ambushed and 250 of their men were killed; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan, and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan. Eventually, the spoils for winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894 included [[Taiwan]].<ref>S.C.M. Paine, ''The Japanese Empire: Grand Strategy from the Meiji Restoration to the Pacific War'' (2017) pp 15-48.</ref>\n\nIn 1875 Japan took its first operation against [[Kingdom of Joseon|Joseon Korea]], another territory that for centuries it coveted; the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] made Korea open to international trade. [[Korea]] was annexed in 1910. As a result of winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, Japan took part of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] from Russia. Precisely, the victory against the [[Russian Empire]] shook the world: never before an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat. Japan's victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for [[Decolonization]]. During [[World War I]], Japan took German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]], and kept the islands as League of nations mandates. At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area. By the '30s, economic depression, urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the Allied powers made Japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance. Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance. In 1931 Japan took [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]] from China. International reactions condemned this move, but Japan's already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on.<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) pp 3-54.</ref>\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937.]]\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China. Also, in 1938-1939 Japan made an attempt to seize the territory of Soviet Russia and Mongolia, but suffered a serious defeats (see [[Battle of Lake Khasan]], [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]]). By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced. Thus a military move to gain access to them was needed, and so Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], bringing the United States to World War II. Using its superior technological advances in [[naval aviation]] and its modern doctrines of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[naval warfare]], Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history. By 1942 Japan had conquered much of East Asia and the Pacific, including the east of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of [[New Guinea]] and many islands of the Pacific Ocean. Just as Japan's late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European \"[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]\". This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests, especially in Indonesia. However, the United States had a vastly stronger military and industrial base and defeated Japan, stripping it of conquests and returning its settlers back to Japan.<ref>Ramon H. Myers and Mark R.

In 1453, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] besieged the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], resulting in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] after 1,500 years of Roman rule, thereafter making it the capital of the empire. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of [[Southeast Europe]], [[Western Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] to escape persecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained [[Provinces of the Ottoman Empire|32 provinces]] and numerous [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal states]]. Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.<ref>Jane Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 1516\u20131800'' (2008).</ref>\n\nWith [[Constantinople]] as its capital and control of lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean basin]], the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military setbacks]] against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|declined]] in its ability to remain sovereign against competing powers in the late 19th century.\n\nThe collapse of the Ottoman Empire was accelerated by the intervention of the great powers. In 1821-1829 the Greeks in their struggle for independence were assisted by the Russian Empire, Great Britain, and the Kingdom of France (see [[Greek War of Independence]]). \nLater in fact, the Ottoman Empire could exist only in the conditions of acute rivalry of the great powers. Russia's attempt to negotiate with Britain on the partition of the Ottoman Empire failed. Britain after the conclusion of [[Treaty of Balta Liman]] in 1838 was interested in preserving the Ottoman Empire and in [[Crimean war]] 1853\u20131856, the great powers of Britain and France opposed Russia, as a result of the Ottoman Empire existed until 1922. As result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]], Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro gained independence in the European part of the Empire.\n\nThe empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|dissolved]] in the aftermath of its defeat in the [[First World War]]. At the same time, Turkey itself could barely avoid the fate of being divided into colonies of great powers, see [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. The result was the [[Turkish War of Independence]], when Kemalist forces backed by Soviet Russia established the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The residue was the new state of [[Turkey]] in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern [[Balkan]] and [[Middle East]]ern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.<ref>Caroline Finkel, (2005).

This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]] took place after Polish nobility from the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] wrote the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]]. The war resulted in eastern [[Poland]] being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918. The southern campaigns involved a series of [[Russo-Persian Wars]], which began with the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], resulting in the acquisition of [[Georgia (country)]] as a protectorate. Between 1800 and 1864, Imperial armies invaded south in the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]], the [[Murid War]], and the [[Russo-Circassian War]]. This last conflict led to the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]] from their lands. The [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] over the [[Khanate of Sibir]] took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Koryaks]], the [[Itelmens]], [[Mansi people]] and the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today. The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed [[Cossacks]] hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate [[Sosloviye]] in the late 18th century. Cossacks were then used in Imperial Russian campaigns against other tribes.<ref>Willard Sunderland, \"An Empire of Peasants. Empire-Building, Interethnic Interaction, and Ethnic Stereotyping in the Rural World of the Russian Empire, 1800\u20131850s.\" ''Imperial Russia. New histories for the Empire'' (1998): 174\u2013198.</ref>\n\nBut it would be a strong simplification to reduce expansion of Russia only to military conquests. The reunification of Ukraine with Russia took place in 1654, when Polish rule brought the population of Ukraine to revolts (see [[Pereyaslav Council]]). Another example is Georgia's accession to Russia in 1783. Given Georgia's history of invasions from the south, an alliance with Russia may have been seen as the only way to discourage or resist Persian and Ottoman aggression, while also establishing a link to Western Europe (see [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]). Russia's support helped establish independent Mongolia (independent from China) (see [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911]]).\n\n[[Bolshevik]] leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/crnq/index.htm |author=V.I.

Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the [[Age of Discovery]], such as those undertaken by [[Christopher Columbus]], Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the [[Caribbean basin]]. Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of ''[[Conquistador]]s'', which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies.\n\n==== Imperialism in the Caribbean basin ====\n[[File:Spanish Caribbean Islands in the American Viceroyalties 1600.png|thumb|upright=2|Spanish colonies and territories in the Caribbean basin (c. 1490 \u2013 c. 1660)]]\nIn congruence with the colonialist activities of competing European imperial powers throughout the 15th \u2013 19th centuries, the Spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power. The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism. Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Inca Empire]], Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation's imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin.\n\nEchoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain's European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin.\n\nWhile leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the [[Ta\u00edno|Ta\u03afno]] populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system during the 16th\u201317th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.\n\n==== Scholarly debate and controversy ====\nThe scope and scale of Spanish participation in imperialism within the Caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians. A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism. Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists.\n\nAmong historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th\u201319th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically-driven form of imperialism. Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism.\n\nFurther divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought. Noteworthy examples include [[cultural imperialism]], whereby proponents such as John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Modammadi define imperialism as ''\"...the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one.\"''<ref>Downing, John; Ali Mohammadi; Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). ''Questioning the media: a critical introduction'' (2, illustrated ed.). Sage. p. 482. {{ISBN|978-0-8039-7197-4}}.</ref> Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force.\" Moreover, colonialism is understood as ''\"...the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners.\"''<ref>Downing; Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). p. 482.</ref>\n\nIn spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians, within the context of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean basin during the colonial era, imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism. In this context, colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives.\n\n===Sweden===\n\n{{main|Swedish overseas colonies}}\n\n{{sectstub|date=April 2020}}\n=== Venezuela ===\n[[File:Guayana_Esequiba_(zona_completa).png|thumb|Striped, the [[Guayana Esequiba]] area claimed by Venezuela|270x270px]]\n\n==== Republic of Venezuela ====\nVenezuela has had a history of expansionist actions to add to its territory and regional influence.
