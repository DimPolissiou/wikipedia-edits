Other significant Sinhala texts include ''Am\u0101vatura'', ''Kavu Silumina'', ''Jathaka Potha'' and ''Sala Liheeniya''.

Due to the proximity and on some occasions similarity of certain doctrines, there are many areas where Buddhists and Hindus share religious views and practices. This can lead to the opinion that Buddhists have adopted religious elements from Hindu traditions in their religious practices.

Its main domains are sculpture, fine arts, literature, dancing, poetry and a wide variety of folk beliefs and rituals traditionally. Ancient Sinhala stone sculpture and inscriptions are known worldwide and is a main foreign attraction in modern tourism. Sigirirya is famous for its frescoes. Folk poems were sung by workers to accompany their work and narrate the story of their lives. Ideally these poems consisted of four lines and, in the composition of these poems, special attention had been paid to the rhyming patterns. Buddhist festivals are dotted by unique music using traditionally Sinhalese instruments. More ancient rituals like tovils (devil exorcism) continue to enthral audiences today and often praised and admired the good and the power of Buddha and gods in order to exorcise the demons.\n\n===Folklore and national mythology===\nAccording to the [[Mahavamsa]], the Sinhalese are descended from the exiled [[Prince Vijaya]] and his party of seven hundred followers who arrived on the island in 543 [[BCE]]. Vijaya and his followers were said to have arrived in Sri Lanka after being exiled from the city of [[Sinhapura]] in [[Bengal]]. The modern Sinhalese people as said in the Mahavamsa were found to be most closely related to the people of North-East India (Bengal).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Papiha SS, Mastana SS, Purandare CA, Jayasekara R, Chakraborty R |title=Population genetic study of three VNTR loci (D2S44, D7S22, and D12S11) in five ethnically defined populations of the Indian subcontinent |journal=Human Biology |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=819\u201335 |year=1996 |pmid=8908803 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malavige GN, Rostron T, Seneviratne SL, Fernando S, Sivayogan S, Wijewickrama A, Ogg GS |title=HLA analysis of Sri Lankan Sinhalese predicts North Indian origin |journal=International Journal of Immunogenetics |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=313\u20135 |year=2007 |pmid=17845299 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-313X.2007.00698.x }}</ref> It is thought throughout Sri Lanka's history, since the founding of the Sinhalese in the 5th century BC that an influx of Indians from North India came to the island. This is further supported from Sinhala being part of the Indo-Aryan language group.

Men may wear a long-sleeved shirt with the sarong, while women wear a tight-fitting, short-sleeved jacket with a wrap-around called the ''cheeththaya''. In the more populated areas, Sinhalese men also wear Western-style clothing &mdash; wearing suits while the women wear skirts and blouses. For formal and ceremonial occasions women wear the traditional [[Kandy]]an (Osaria) style, which consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The Kandyan style is considered as the national dress of Sinhalese women. In many occasions and functions, even the ''saree'' plays an important role in women's clothing and has become the de facto clothing for female office workers especially in government sector. An example of its use is the uniform of air hostesses of [[Sri Lankan Airlines]].<ref name=\"everyculsin\">Everyculture. (2009). Sinhalese - Religion and Expressive Culture.

As a major trade hub, it draws influence from [[colonial powers]] that were involved in [[Sri Lanka]] and by foreign traders. [[Rice]], which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy [[curry|curries]] are favourite dishes for [[lunch]] and [[dinner]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sltouristguide.com/foods.html |title=Food in Sri Lanka |publisher=Sltouristguide.com |accessdate=2013-03-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114919/http://sltouristguide.com/foods.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to [[Kerala cuisine]], which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with [[Kerala]].  A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is [[Kiribath]], meaning \"Milk Rice.\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \"Mallung\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated [[coconut]] and red [[onion]]s. [[Coconut milk]] is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.\n\nSri Lanka has long been renowned for its [[spices]]. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special [[curry]], accompanied by ''frikkadels'' ([[meatballs]]), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include [[roast beef]] and [[roast chicken]]. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.\n\nThe island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \"main curry\" of [[Fish (food)|fish]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], as well as several other curries made with [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and even [[fruit]] curries. Side-dishes include [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[chutney]]s and \"sambols\". The most famous of these is the [[Pol Sambola (Coconut Sambol)|coconut sambol]], made of ground coconut mixed with [[chili pepper]]s, dried [[Maldive fish]] and [[lime juice]]. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Sri Lanka}}\n[[File:British Museum Asia 45 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gilded bronze statue of the Bodhisattva [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], from the [[Anuradhapura]] period, 8th century.]]\n\nMany forms of Sri Lankan arts and crafts take inspiration from the island's long and lasting [[Buddhist]] culture which in turn has absorbed and adopted countless regional and local traditions. In most instances Sri Lankan art originates from religious beliefs, and is represented in many forms such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]]. One of the most notable aspects of Sri Lankan art are caves and temple paintings, such as the frescoes found at [[Sigiriya]], and religious paintings found in temples in [[Dambulla]] and [[Temple of the Tooth]] Relic in [[Kandy]]. Other popular forms of art have been influenced by both natives as well as outside settlers. For example, traditional wooden handicrafts and clay pottery are found around the hill country while Portuguese-inspired lacework and Indonesian-inspired [[Batik]] have become notable. It has many different and beautiful drawings.\n\nDeveloped upon Indo-Aryan architectural skills in the late 6th century BCE Sinhalese people who lived upon greater kingdoms such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have built so many architectural examples such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]], [[Jetavanaramaya]] - second tallest brick building in the ancient world after [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], and [[Abayagiriya]] - third tallest brick building in the ancient world.  And also with the ancient hydraulic technology which is also unique to Sinhalese people to build ancient tanks, systematic ponds with fountains moats and Irrigational reservoirs such as [[Parakrama Samudra]], Kawdulla and [[Kandalama]]. Sigirya which consider as the 8th wonder of the world is a combination of natural and man made fortress, which consists so many architectural aspects.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Sri Lanka}}\n\nConcerning popular music, [[Ananda Samarakoon]] developed the reflective and poignant Sarala gee style with his work in the late 1930s/early 1940s. He has been followed by artists of repute such as [[Sunil Shantha]], [[W. D. Amaradeva]], [[Premasiri Khemadasa]], [[Nanda Malini]], [[Victor Ratnayake]], Austin Munasinghe, [[T. M. Jayaratne]], [[Sanath Nandasiri]], [[Sunil Edirisinghe]], Neela Wickremasinghe, [[Gunadasa Kapuge]], Malini Bulathsinghala and [[Edward Jayakody]].\n\n===Film and theatre===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sri Lanka}}\nDramatist [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]] revitalised the drama form with ''Maname'' in 1956. The same year, film director [[Lester James Peries]] created the artistic masterwork ''[[Rekava]]'' which sought to create a uniquely Sinhalese cinema with artistic integrity. Since then, Peries and other directors like [[Vasantha Obeysekera]], [[Dharmasena Pathiraja]], [[Mahagama Sekera]], W. A. B. de Silva, [[Dharmasiri Bandaranayake]], [[Sunil Ariyaratne]], [[Siri Gunasinghe]], G. D. L. Perera, Piyasiri Gunaratne, [[Titus Thotawatte]], [[D. B. Nihalsinghe]], Ranjith Lal, [[Dayananda Gunawardena]], Mudalinayake Somaratne, [[Asoka Handagama]], and [[Prasanna Vithanage]] have developed an artistic Sinhalese cinema. Sinhala cinema is often made colourful with the incorporation of songs and dance adding more uniqueness to the industry.\n\nIn the recent years high budget films like [[Aloko Udapadi]], [[Aba (film)]] and [[Maharaja Gemunu]] based on Sinhalese [[epic film|epic]] [[historical]] stories gain huge success.\n\n===Performing arts===\n[[File:GataBeraya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Kandyan Drummer]]\nPerforming arts of the Sinhalese people can be categorised into few groups:\n\n*[[Kandyan dance]] consist of 18 Wannam (dance routines) featuring behaviours of various animals such as elephant, eagle, cobra, monkey, peacock and rabbit, mainly performing in Annual Perahara pagent in [[Temple of the Tooth|Sri Dalada Maligawa]] Kandy.\n*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Low Country Dances (Pahatharata Natum)|Pahatharata dance]] have a significant dancing style which is used to cure illnesses and spiritual clarification.The main feature of these dances is dancers wear masks representing various Gods and Demons, and use elements such as fire and water to bless people.\n*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Sabaragamu dances (Sabaragamuwa Natum)|Sabaragamuwa dances]] have also a significant dancing style, mainly to entertain people.\n*Folk Music and Dances differ according to the casts of Sinhalese people and also some times regionally--mainly popular among small children, especially girls.These arts are widely performed during the Sinhalese New year period.\n\n===Martial arts===\n{{Main|Sinhalese martial arts}}\n[[File:Angampora high click.JPG|200px|thumb|rightthumb|Angampora high click.]]\n\nAngampora is the traditional [[martial art]] of the Sinhalese people.

Its most distinct feature is the use of [[pressure point]] attacks to inflict pain or permanently paralyse the opponent. Fighters usually make use of both [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[grappling]] techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission [[Joint lock|lock]] that they cannot escape. Usage of weapons is discretionary.

Its main domains are sculpture, fine arts, literature, dancing, poetry and a wide variety of folk beliefs and rituals traditionally. Ancient Sinhala stone sculpture and inscriptions are known worldwide and is a main foreign attraction in modern tourism. Sigirirya is famous for its frescoes. Folk poems were sung by workers to accompany their work and narrate the story of their lives. Ideally these poems consisted of four lines and, in the composition of these poems, special attention had been paid to the rhyming patterns. Buddhist festivals are dotted by unique music using traditionally Sinhalese instruments. More ancient rituals like tovils (devil exorcism) continue to enthral audiences today and often praised and admired the good and the power of Buddha and gods in order to exorcise the demons.\n\n===Folklore and national mythology===\nAccording to the [[Mahavamsa]], the Sinhalese are descended from the exiled [[Prince Vijaya]] and his party of seven hundred followers who arrived on the island in 543 [[BCE]]. Vijaya and his followers were said to have arrived in Sri Lanka after being exiled from the city of [[Sinhapura]] in [[Bengal]].

Men may wear a long-sleeved shirt with the sarong, while women wear a tight-fitting, short-sleeved jacket with a wrap-around called the ''cheeththaya''. In the more populated areas, Sinhalese men also wear Western-style clothing &mdash; wearing suits while the women wear skirts and blouses. For formal and ceremonial occasions women wear the traditional [[Kandy]]an (Osaria) style, which consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The Kandyan style is considered as the national dress of Sinhalese women. In many occasions and functions, even the ''saree'' plays an important role in women's clothing and has become the de facto clothing for female office workers especially in government sector. An example of its use is the uniform of air hostesses of [[Sri Lankan Airlines]].<ref name=\"everyculsin\">Everyculture. (2009). Sinhalese - Religion and Expressive Culture.

A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is [[Kiribath]], meaning \"Milk Rice.\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \"Mallung\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated [[coconut]] and red [[onion]]s. [[Coconut milk]] is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.\n\nSri Lanka has long been renowned for its [[spices]]. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special [[curry]], accompanied by ''frikkadels'' ([[meatballs]]), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include [[roast beef]] and [[roast chicken]]. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.\n\nThe island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \"main curry\" of [[Fish (food)|fish]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], as well as several other curries made with [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and even [[fruit]] curries. Side-dishes include [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[chutney]]s and \"sambols\". The most famous of these is the [[Pol Sambola (Coconut Sambol)|coconut sambol]], made of ground coconut mixed with [[chili pepper]]s, dried [[Maldive fish]] and [[lime juice]]. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Sri Lanka}}\n[[File:British Museum Asia 45 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gilded bronze statue of the Bodhisattva [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], from the [[Anuradhapura]] period, 8th century.]]\n\nMany forms of Sri Lankan arts and crafts take inspiration from the island's long and lasting [[Buddhist]] culture which in turn has absorbed and adopted countless regional and local traditions. In most instances Sri Lankan art originates from religious beliefs, and is represented in many forms such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]]. One of the most notable aspects of Sri Lankan art are caves and temple paintings, such as the frescoes found at [[Sigiriya]], and religious paintings found in temples in [[Dambulla]] and [[Temple of the Tooth]] Relic in [[Kandy]]. Other popular forms of art have been influenced by both natives as well as outside settlers. For example, traditional wooden handicrafts and clay pottery are found around the hill country while Portuguese-inspired lacework and Indonesian-inspired [[Batik]] have become notable. It has many different and beautiful drawings.\n\nDeveloped upon Indo-Aryan architectural skills in the late 6th century BCE Sinhalese people who lived upon greater kingdoms such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have built so many architectural examples such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]], [[Jetavanaramaya]] - second tallest brick building in the ancient world after [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], and [[Abayagiriya]] - third tallest brick building in the ancient world.  And also with the ancient hydraulic technology which is also unique to Sinhalese people to build ancient tanks, systematic ponds with fountains moats and Irrigational reservoirs such as [[Parakrama Samudra]], Kawdulla and [[Kandalama]]. Sigirya which consider as the 8th wonder of the world is a combination of natural and man made fortress, which consists so many architectural aspects.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Sri Lanka}}\n\nConcerning popular music, [[Ananda Samarakoon]] developed the reflective and poignant Sarala gee style with his work in the late 1930s/early 1940s. He has been followed by artists of repute such as [[Sunil Shantha]], [[W. D. Amaradeva]], [[Premasiri Khemadasa]], [[Nanda Malini]], [[Victor Ratnayake]], Austin Munasinghe, [[T. M. Jayaratne]], [[Sanath Nandasiri]], [[Sunil Edirisinghe]], Neela Wickremasinghe, [[Gunadasa Kapuge]], Malini Bulathsinghala and [[Edward Jayakody]].\n\n===Film and theatre===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sri Lanka}}\nDramatist [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]] revitalised the drama form with ''Maname'' in 1956. The same year, film director [[Lester James Peries]] created the artistic masterwork ''[[Rekava]]'' which sought to create a uniquely Sinhalese cinema with artistic integrity. Since then, Peries and other directors like [[Vasantha Obeysekera]], [[Dharmasena Pathiraja]], [[Mahagama Sekera]], W. A. B. de Silva, [[Dharmasiri Bandaranayake]], [[Sunil Ariyaratne]], [[Siri Gunasinghe]], G. D. L. Perera, Piyasiri Gunaratne, [[Titus Thotawatte]], [[D. B. Nihalsinghe]], Ranjith Lal, [[Dayananda Gunawardena]], Mudalinayake Somaratne, [[Asoka Handagama]], and [[Prasanna Vithanage]] have developed an artistic Sinhalese cinema. Sinhala cinema is often made colourful with the incorporation of songs and dance adding more uniqueness to the industry.\n\nIn the recent years high budget films like [[Aloko Udapadi]], [[Aba (film)]] and [[Maharaja Gemunu]] based on Sinhalese [[epic film|epic]] [[historical]] stories gain huge success.\n\n===Performing arts===\n[[File:GataBeraya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Kandyan Drummer]]\nPerforming arts of the Sinhalese people can be categorised into few groups:\n\n*[[Kandyan dance]] consist of 18 Wannam (dance routines) featuring behaviours of various animals such as elephant, eagle, cobra, monkey, peacock and rabbit, mainly performing in Annual Perahara pagent in [[Temple of the Tooth|Sri Dalada Maligawa]] Kandy.\n*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Low Country Dances (Pahatharata Natum)|Pahatharata dance]] have a significant dancing style which is used to cure illnesses and spiritual clarification.The main feature of these dances is dancers wear masks representing various Gods and Demons, and use elements such as fire and water to bless people.\n*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Sabaragamu dances (Sabaragamuwa Natum)|Sabaragamuwa dances]] have also a significant dancing style, mainly to entertain people.\n*Folk Music and Dances differ according to the casts of Sinhalese people and also some times regionally--mainly popular among small children, especially girls.These arts are widely performed during the Sinhalese New year period.\n\n===Martial arts===\n{{Main|Sinhalese martial arts}}\n[[File:Angampora high click.JPG|200px|thumb|rightthumb|Angampora high click.]]\n\nAngampora is the traditional [[martial art]] of the Sinhalese people.

Fighters usually make use of both [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[grappling]] techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission [[Joint lock|lock]] that they cannot escape.

One of the last bushrangers, and by far the most famous, he is best known for wearing [[armour of the Kelly gang|a suit of bulletproof armour]] during his final shootout with the police.\n\nKelly was born in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as the third of eight children to Irish parents. His father, a [[Convicts in Australia|transported convict]], died shortly after serving a six-month prison sentence, leaving Kelly, then aged 12, as the eldest male of the household. The Kellys were a poor [[selection (Australian history)|selector]] family who saw themselves as downtrodden by the [[squatting (pastoral)|Squattocracy]] and as victims of persecution by the [[Victoria Police]]. While a teenager, Kelly was arrested for associating with bushranger [[Harry Power]], and served two prison terms for a variety of offences, the longest stretch being from 1871 to 1874 on a conviction of receiving a stolen horse. He later joined the \"[[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] mob\", a group of [[Australian bush|bush]] [[larrikin]]s known for stock theft. A violent confrontation with a policeman occurred at the Kelly family's home in 1878, and Kelly was indicted for his attempted murder. Fleeing to the bush, Kelly vowed to avenge his mother, who was imprisoned for her role in the incident. After he, his younger brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and two associates\u2014[[Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]]\u2014shot dead three policemen, the [[Government of Victoria]] proclaimed them [[outlaw]]s.\n\nKelly and his gang eluded the police for two years, thanks in part to the support of an extensive network of sympathisers. The gang's crime spree included raids on [[Euroa]] and [[Jerilderie]], and the killing of [[Aaron Sherritt]], a sympathiser turned police informer. In [[Jerilderie Letter|a manifesto letter]], Kelly\u2014denouncing the police, the Victorian government and the [[British Empire]]\u2014set down his own account of the events leading up to his outlawry. Demanding justice for his family and the rural poor, he threatened dire consequences against those who defied him. In 1880, when Kelly's attempt to derail and ambush a police train failed, he and his gang, dressed in armour fashioned from stolen [[plough#Parts|plough mouldboards]], engaged in a final gun battle with the police at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]]. Kelly, the only survivor, was severely wounded by police fire and captured. Despite thousands of supporters attending rallies and signing a petition for his reprieve, Kelly was tried, convicted and sentenced to [[Hanging|death by hanging]], which was carried out at the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]]. His [[last words]] were famously reported to have been, \"[[:wikt:such is life|Such is life]]\".\n\nHistorian [[Geoffrey Serle]] called Kelly and his gang \"the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to [[Melbourne]] and the world\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Serle|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Serle|title=The Rush to Be Rich: A History of the Colony of Victoria 1883\u20131889|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0-522-84009-4|page=11}}</ref> In the century after his death, Kelly became a [[cultural icon]], inspiring [[Ned Kelly in popular culture|numerous works in the arts and popular culture]], and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian.

This is a highly unusual ratio for the time, and led to claims that Kelly's family was unfairly targeted from the time they moved to northeast Victoria. Perhaps the move was necessary because of Kelly's mother's squabbles with family members and her appearances in court over family disputes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1995|p=25}}</ref> The author Antony O'Brien has argued that Victoria's colonial police practices treated arrest as equivalent to proof of guilt.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2002|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Rise to notoriety==\n===Bushranging with Harry Power===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Bushranger Harry Power.jpg\n | width1    = 138\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = [[Harry Power]] has been described as Kelly's bushranging \"mentor\".\n | image2    = Harry Power capture.jpg \n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Power's capture. Kelly was falsely accused of informing on the bushranger.\n }}\nIn 1869, aged fourteen, Kelly met Irish-born [[Harry Power]] (alias of Henry Johnson), a transported convict who turned to bushranging in North-Eastern Victoria after escaping Melbourne's [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]]. The Kellys formed part of his network of sympathisers, and by May 1869, Ned had become his bushranging prot\u00e9g\u00e9. At the end of the month, they attempted to steal horses from the [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] property of squatter John Rower as part of a plan to rob the [[Woods Point, Victoria|Woods Point]]\u2013Mansfield gold escort. They abandoned the idea and fled back into the bush after Rower shot at them, and Kelly temporarily broke off his association with Power.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nKelly's first brush with the law occurred in mid-October 1869 over an altercation between him and a Chinese pig and fowl dealer from [[Morses Creek]] named Ah Fook. According to Fook, as he passed the Kelly family home, Ned brandished a long stick and declared himself a bushranger before robbing him of 10 shillings. Fook then travelled to Benalla to give his account of what happened to Sergeant James Whelan, who was, according to fellow officers, \"a perfect encyclopedia of knowledge\" about the Kellys and their criminal activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010}} The next morning, Whelan chased down Kelly in the bush outside Greta and took him to Benalla, where he testified in court the next day that Fook abused his sister Annie for giving him creek water, not rain water, when, as a traveller, he requested a drink. Then, the story went, Fook beat Ned with a stick after he came to his sister's defence. Annie and two family-related witnesses corroborated Ned's story. Given that no other witnesses came forward, the charge was dismissed on 26 October and Kelly was released.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nKelly reconciled with Power in March 1870, and over the next month, the pair committed a series of armed robberies as police scrambled to find them and identify Power's young accomplice. By the end of April, the press had named Kelly as the culprit, and a few days later, he was captured by police and confined to [[HM Prison Beechworth|Beechworth Gaol]]. Kelly fronted court on three separate robbery charges, the first two of which were dismissed as none of the victims could positively identify him. On the third charge, the victims also reportedly failed to identify Kelly, but they were in fact refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded for trial. He was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in a lock-up before being transferred to [[Kyneton]] to face court. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of [[Police misconduct|police harassment]]; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a \"[[half-caste]]\" (a person of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] and European descent). However, the police believed this to be the result of Kelly going unwashed.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nPower often camped at Glenmore Station, a large property owned by Kelly's maternal grandfather, James Quinn, which sat at the headwaters of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]]. In June 1870, while resting in a mountainside [[humpy|gunyah]] (bark shelter) that overlooked the property, Power was captured by a police search party. Following Power's arrest, word spread within the community that Kelly had informed on him. Kelly denied the rumour, and in [[s:Ned Kelly Letter to Sgt. James Babington|a letter]] that bears the only surviving example of his handwriting, he pleads with Sergeant James Babington of Kyneton for help, saying that \"everyone looks on me like a black snake\". The informant turned out to be Kelly's uncle, Jack Lloyd, who received \u00a3500 for his assistance.\n\nReporting on Power's criminal career, the ''[[Benalla Ensign]]'' wrote:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The effect of his example has already been to draw one young fellow into the open vortex of crime, and unless his career is speedily cut short, young Kelly will blossom into a declared enemy of society.}}\n\n===Horse theft, assault and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ned Kelly aged 15.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mugshot of Kelly, aged 15]]\nIn October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused a friend of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of stealing his horse. Gould wrote an indecent note to give to McCormack's childless wife, that was used to wrap two calves's [[testicles]]. Kelly passed it to one of his cousins to give to the woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall. Kelly was arrested for his part in sending the calves' parts and the note and for assaulting McCormack. He was sentenced to three months' [[hard labour]] on each charge.\n\nKelly was released from Beechworth Gaol on 27 March 1871, five weeks early, and returned to Greta. Three weeks later, horse-breaker Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright arrived in town on what Kelly later described as a \"very remarkable\" chestnut [[mare]]. Wright visited the Kelly homestead to see his friend Alex Gunn, a Scottish miner who had married Kellys' older sister. Wright intended to ride the borrowed mare back to [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]], the home town of its owner, but discovered the next morning it had gone missing. Gunn lent him one of his own horses, promising that, if he found the mare, he would keep it until Wright returned. Soon after Wright departed, the mare was found by Gunn and a neighbour, William (Bricky) Williamson. Kelly then took the mare to [[Wangaratta]], where he stayed for four days. On 20 April 1871, while riding back into Greta, Kelly was intercepted by Constable Edward Hall, who suspected that the horse was stolen. He directed Kelly to the police station on the pretence of having to sign some papers. As Kelly dismounted, Hall tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but failed. When Kelly resisted arrest, Hall drew his revolver and tried to shoot him, but it misfired three times. He was then overpowered by Kelly, who later said that he straddled him and dug spurs into his thighs, causing the constable to \"[roar] like a big calf attacked by dogs\". After subduing Kelly with the assistance of seven bystanders, Hall [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] him until his head became \"a mass of raw and bleeding flesh\".{{sfn|FitzSimons|2013|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough Kelly maintained that he did not know the mare belonged to someone other than Wright, he and Gunn were charged with horse stealing. When it was later revealed that Kelly was still imprisoned at Beechworth Gaol when the horse was taken, the charges were downgraded to \"feloniously receiving a horse\". Kelly and Gunn were sentenced to three years imprisonment with hard labour. Wright escaped arrest for the theft on 2 May following an \"exchange of shots\" with police, but was arrested the following day at the Kelly homestead and received eighteen months for stealing the horse.\n\n[[File:Ned Kelly boxing.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelly after defeating Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright in a 20-round bare-knuckle boxing match, August 1874]] \nKelly served his sentence at Beechworth Gaol, then at [[HM Prison Pentridge]] near Melbourne. On 25 June 1873, Kelly's good behaviour earned him a transfer to the [[prison hulk]] ''Sacramento'', anchored off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. He returned to Pentridge after several months and was released on 2 February 1874, six months early for good behaviour. That same month, his mother Ellen married an American, George King, with whom she had three children. King, Kelly and Dan Kelly became involved in cattle duffing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126825077 |title=Overview of Kellyana |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=1 March 1981 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12452635|title=WE HAVE NO CATTLE \"RUSTLERS\" HERE |newspaper=[[The Argus Week-end Magazine]] |date=27 April 1940 |accessdate=6 December 2019 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTo settle the score with Wright over the chestnut mare, Kelly fought him in a bare-knuckle boxing match at the Imperial Hotel in Beechworth, 8 August 1874. Kelly won after 20 rounds and was declared the unofficial boxing champion of the district.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=}} Soon afterwards, a Melbourne photographer took a portrait of Kelly in a boxing pose.

The next day, while he was escorted by four policemen, he absconded and ran, taking refuge in a shoemaker's shop. The police and the shop owner tried to handcuff him but failed. During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at [[Stringybark Creek]], \"black-balled\" him (grabbed and squeezed his [[testicle]]s).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=26}} During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said \"You should be ashamed of yourselves.\" He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly to put on the handcuffs.<ref name=\"KELLY INTERVIEWED\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70946696|title=Kelly Interviewed|date=14 August 1880|newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]|accessdate=16 June 2014|page=9|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nKelly said about the incident, \"It was in the course of this attempted arrest Fitzpatrick endeavoured to catch hold of me by the foot, and in the struggle he tore the sole and heel of my boot clean off.

As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kelly\u2019s, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. Fitzpatrick was aware of a warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing and he discussed with his sergeant at Benalla the idea of calling at the Kelly home on the way with the object of arresting Dan Kelly. The sergeant agreed with his actions, but warned him to be careful. He was instructed to proceed to Greta and rode through Wilton en route to Greta, stopping at the hotel there where he had one brandy and lemonade.\u00a0\n\nFinding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William \"Bricky\" Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kelly\u2019s).\n\nFitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and stood near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. At the same time Ellen Kelly, Ned\u2019s mother, attacked Fitzpatrick hitting him over the head with a fire shovel, knocking him senseless.\n\nFitzpatrick stated that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers, that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist, and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. \n\nOn regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped to the Winton hotel where he was assisted inside by the manager. He was offered a brandy and lemonade which he refused, but later accepted one drink. On regaining safety, he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer, when he reached Benalla accompanied by the hotel manager who rode with him.\n\n===Kelly's version of events===\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The witness which can prove Fitzpatrick's falsehood can be found by advertising and if this is not done immediately horrible disasters shall follow. Fitzpatrick shall be the cause of greater slaughter to the rising generation than St. Patrick was to the snakes and toads in Ireland.

Retrieved 31 August 2017.</ref>\n}}\n\nIn an interview three months before his execution, Kelly said that at the time of the incident, he was 200 miles from home, and according to him, his mother had asked Fitzpatrick if he had a warrant, and Fitzpatrick said that he had only a [[Telegraphy|telegram]], to which his mother said that Dan need not go. Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, \"I will blow your brains out if you interfere\". His mother replied, \"You would not be so handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here\". Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, \"There is Ned coming along by the side of the house\". While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed.\n\nKelly asserted that he was not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk when he arrived at the Kellys, that while he was waiting for Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. \n\nAfter Ned Kelly was captured, he was asked by a journalist if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said \"No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him\". Kelly also admitted to having shot Fitzpatrick after his capture. Under oath, during Kelly\u2019s trial in Melbourne, Senior Constable Kelly described a conversation he had with Ned Kelly immediately after he had been captured at Glenrowan. \u201cBetween 3 and 6 the same morning had another conversation with prisoner in the presence of Constable Ryan. Gave him some milk and water. Asked him if Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement was correct. Prisoner said, \u201cYes, I shot him\u201d.\n\n===Trial===\nWilliamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan were nowhere to be found, but Ellen was taken into custody, along with her baby, Alice. At the Benalla Court, on 17 May 1878, Williamson, Skillion and Ellen Kelly, while on remand, were charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder. The three appeared on 9 October 1878 before Judge [[Redmond Barry]] and charged with attempted murder. Despite Fitzpatrick's doctor reporting a smell of alcohol on the constable and his inability to confirm the wrist wound was caused by a bullet, Fitzpatrick's evidence was accepted by the police, the judge, and the jury. The three were convicted on Fitzpatrick's evidence. Fitzpatrick's evidence would later be corroborated by Williamson when he was interviewed in prison by Captain Frederick Standish. Mrs Kelly, Skillion and Williamson were tried and convicted of accessory to attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson both received sentences of six years and Ellen three years of hard labour. Barry stated that if Kelly were present he would \"give him 15 years\". Frank Harty, a successful and well-known farmer in the area, offered to pay Ellen Kelly's bail upon which bail was immediately refused.  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\nEllen Kelly's sentence was considered unfair even by people who had no cause to be Kelly sympathizers. Alfred Wyatt, a police magistrate headquartered in Benalla, told the commission later that \"I thought the sentence upon that old woman, Mrs Kelly, a very severe one.\" Enoch Downes, a truant officer, recounted to the commission in 1881 that while speaking to Joe Byrne's mother, he said that he did not believe in the sentence and \"if policy had been used or consideration for the mother shown that two or three months would have been ample\".  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\n==Stringybark Creek police murders==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=300\n| image1 = Bushranger Dan Kelly.jpg  |width1=157|height1=\n| image2 = SteveHart.jpg  |width2=143|height2=\n| image3 = Joe Byrne the 19th-century outlaw.jpg  |width3=177|height3=\n| footer = Greta mob members [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]] (left), [[Steve Hart]] (centre) and [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] (right) took to bushranging with Ned Kelly after the Fitzpatrick incident.\n}}\n\n[[File:Mansfield-police-photomontage.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Constable Lonigan, Sergeant Kennedy, Constable McIntyre and Constable Scanlan.]]\n[[File:MansfieldKellyMonument.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument erected in [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] in 1880 in honour of the policemen murdered at Stringybark Creek]]\nAfter the sentences were handed down in Benalla Police Court, both Ned and Dan Kelly doubted that they could convince the police of their story.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=44}} So they went into hiding, where they were later joined by friends [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]].\n\nThe police had received information that the Kelly gang were in the Wombat Ranges, at the head of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]].

At about noon Lonigan heard a strange noise down by the creek and McIntyre went to investigate, hoping that it could be some [[kangaroo]]s that he could shoot for dinner. Instead, he shot and killed some [[parrot]]s which he cooked for dinner. (Unaware at the time, the sound of the shots alerted the bushrangers to their location.) At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, \"Bail up, hold up your arms\". McIntyre testified that Kelly took his [[fowling piece]], and that all the gang members were armed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114524063 |title=Trail of Ned Kelly.

Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed.  Almost immediately Kelly shifted his aim from McIntyre to Lonigan and fired.  Kelly shot him in the temple.<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> He fell to the ground and said, \"Oh Christ, I am shot\". He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, \"What a pity; what made the fool run?\"<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives:\n{{quote|I told [Kelly] that they were both countrymen and co-religionists of his own. ... I thought he might be possessed of some of that patriotic-religious feeling which is such a bond of sympathy amongst the Irish people. My opinion is that he possessed none of this feeling.

A favourite expression of his was: 'I will let them see what one native [native-born Australian] can do.'}}\n\nMcIntyre asked whether he was to be shot. Kelly replied, \"No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?\" He added, \"At first I thought you were Constable Flood.

It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen\".\n\nMcIntyre asked what they would do if he induced his comrades to surrender. Kelly stated, \"I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands\", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, \"You can depend on us\". Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly \"lagged\" at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114522713 |title=Prosecution of Ned Kelly. |newspaper=[[The Manaro Mercury, and Cooma and Bombala Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=11 August 1880 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stringybark attack.jpg|thumb|left|The Kelly gang prepares to open fire as Kennedy and Scanlan arrive. Lonigan's body lies in the foreground.]]\nAt about 5:30pm Kelly then heard the approach of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, and one in the tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, \"Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm\". Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, \"Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded\". Kelly at the same time called out, \"Put up your hands\". Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, \"It's all right, stop it, stop it\". Scanlan's horse was disturbed and he tried to dismount but fell to the ground, and was on all fours. As he rose Kelly shot him in the right chest killing him almost instantly.  \n\nThis account has been disputed by the great grandson of Sergeant Kennedy, who claims the story has been altered down the years in order to embellish the Kelly myth. He claims Kennedy was wounded twice in a hopeless fight, captured, and then murdered two hours later. by Kelly shooting him at point blank range with a shotgun to the chest. Kelly then robbed the corpse of a gold watch, a notebook and some coins.\n\nMcIntyre, believing that the gang intended to shoot the whole party,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\" /> fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available.

At about midnight, he set about to strike the Benalla road by trekking west, guided by a star. After crossing a number of streams, his feet became chafed, and had to walk with one of his boots off. After a rest, and using a match to illuminate a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farmhouse outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon. He then travelled by buggy to Mansfield and then directly to the residence of Sub-Inspector Pewtress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5919040 |title=The Police Murders |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=30 October 1878 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTwo hours after McIntyre reported the murder of the troopers, Pewtress set out for camp, accompanied by McIntyre, Constable Allwood, Dr Reynolds, and five townspeople.

There they found the bodies of Scanlan and Lonigan, as well as the tent burnt and possessions looted or destroyed.

They ... all went into a room, and were asked the names of the persons in the district whom they considered to be sympathisers. I had nothing to do with it, merely listening and taking down names that fell from the mouths of men.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=79}}}}\n\nPublic opinion was turning against the police on the matter, and on 22 April 1879 the remainder of the sympathisers were released. None were given money or transported back to their home towns; all had to find their way back \"25, 30, and even 50 miles\" on their own.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=85}} The treatment of the 23 men caused resentment of the government's abuse of power that led to condemnation in the media and a groundswell of support for the gang that was a factor in their evading capture for so long.\n\n==Jerilderie raid==\n[[File:Ned Kelly Jerilderie.jpg|thumb|The gang holds up the Jerilderie Police Station.]]\nAccording to a [[Coonamble, New South Wales|Coonamble]] resident who encountered the Kellys at Glenrowan, Ned had heard that an individual named Sullivan had given evidence, and that he had travelled by train from Melbourne to [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]]. The Kelly gang then followed him there, but was told that he went to [[Uralla, New South Wales|Uralla]] across the border in New South Wales. By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for [[Wagga Wagga]]. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], so they took off in that direction but later gave up their chase. On their return home, they passed through [[Jerilderie]], and the gang then decided to rob the bank.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72558543 |title=TALE: By a Resident of Coonamble |newspaper=[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]] |location=NSW |date=5 January 1889 |accessdate=1 November 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAccording to J.J. Kenneally, however, the gang arrived at Jerilderie having crossed the [[Murray River]] at [[Burramine]]. The group had heard of a crossing there, from where they could swim their horses but did not know where the landing place was on the opposite side of the river, so had [[Tom Lloyd (Australia)|Tom Lloyd]] investigate (the river was guarded by border police). After unsuccessfully trying to cross on his own, Lloyd employed the help of an owner of a hotel nearby, who pulled him across in a boat with Lloyd's horse paddling behind. After reporting the trip back to the rest of the gang, the group appropriated the boat to get across in two trips. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart reached Davidson's Hotel two miles south of Jerilderie on Saturday 2 February 1879 in time for tea, while the others waited in another area.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nAt about midnight on 8 February, the gang surrounded the Jerilderie Police Station. Ned rode to the front and shouted for the policemen to come out, claiming there was a drunken brawl at Davidson's Hotel. Constables George Devine and Henry Richards emerged and asked the stranger for more information. Once Ned established there were no other policemen inside, the gang held them up and locked them in a cell.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}} Mary, Devine's wife, and their children were kept hostage inside the house as Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition. After this, he let them return to sleep, and with the rest of the gang stayed in the dining room until morning.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThere was a chapel in the courthouse, 100 yards from the barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied by one of the Kellys. At about 10&nbsp;am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=90}} When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the door was closed and the blinds pulled to give the impression that the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.\n\nOn Monday morning Byrne brought two horses to be shod, but the blacksmith suspected something strange in his manner,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} so he noted the horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith was struck by the quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=91}} About 10&nbsp;am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, \"The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered for the rest of his life\".{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=92\u201393}} Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.\n\nAfter the manager had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living back to the bank and asked him how much money they had. Living admitted to between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, \u00a3691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered \"No\". Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found \u00a31650, making for a total of \u00a32141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing mortgage documents, in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=93}}<ref>Seal, Graham.

He then placed his revolver on the bar and announced, \"Anyone here may take it and shoot me dead, but if I'm shot, Jerilderie shall swim in its own blood.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010}} As the hotel's \"roughs\" cheered Kelly on, he learned that Hart had earlier stolen a watch from a local Methodist clergyman, Reverend J. B. Gribble, and forced him to return it.{{sfn|Jones|2010}} The bushrangers then went to some of the other hotels, treating everyone civilly, and had drinks. Hart took a new saddle from the saddler's. Two splendid police horses were taken, and other horses were wanted, but the residents claimed that they belonged to women, and McDougall in order to keep his race mare \"protested that he was a comparatively poor man\"{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=94}} and Kelly relented. The telegraph operators were also incarcerated.

Believing that Curnow was a sympathiser, Ned let him and his wife return home, but warned them to \"go quietly to bed and not to dream too loud\", as one of the gang would visit during the night. Back at the hotel, Kelly grew increasingly anxious over the train's non-arrival. The delay was caused by the fact that the policemen in Sherritt's hut waited until daylight to emerge and give the alarm, and news of the murder did not reach Melbourne until Sunday afternoon. Only at 1 am on Monday did a police train carrying troopers, [[Australian native police|native trackers]] and several journalists steam into Benalla to collect reinforcements. Upon hearing the train's approach at 3 am, Curnow, despite Kelly's warning, rushed to the line and warned the pilot train to stop by raising a lit candle behind a red scarf. He told the driver of the gang's plan. The trains then slowly made their way to Glenrowan.\n\nAround this time, Kelly decided to let the townspeople return home, but Ann Jones told them to stay to hear the outlaw lecture. Byrne interrupted the conversation, alerting the group about the train's arrival. The gang prepared for action and hurried to dress in their armour. Bracken meanwhile told the hostages to lie low, and escaped to the railway station to explain the situation to the police. Superintendent Hare led six constables and five native trackers towards the hotel where the armour-clad outlaws waited for them on the verandah. As the police approached the police commander Superintendent Hare noticed a single figure standing on the verandah, who immediately opened fire on the police. The police returned fire and the other three gang members all dressed in their armour joined Ned Kelly. In the first volley, Supt Hare was hit in the left wrist, and Ned Kelly was wounded in the left hand and arm and he received a shot to his right foot that entered at the toes and exited at his heel.\n\n{{Wide image|Glenrowan shootout.jpg|700px|The gang and police exchange gunfire. Drawing by [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], one of several journalists present during the battle.}}\n\nThe police and the gang fired at each other for about a quarter of an hour. During a lull, Superintendent Hare returned to the railway station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, and [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], artist for the ''[[Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil|Australasian Sketcher]]'', used his handkerchief to compress the wound. Hare then ordered O'Connor and his men to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to battle, but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be sent to Benalla for treatment. \n\nThe Royal Commission found that Ned Kelly having retreated into the hotel after the first volley almost certainly walked out the back door for about 150 metres leading his horse. At about 100 metres he dropped his rifle and continued where he lay down behind a log until just after 7 am in the morning.\n\nThe police, trackers and civilian volunteers surrounded the hotel throughout the night, and the firing continued intermittently. At about 5 am, nine reinforcements under Superintendent Sadleir arrived from Benalla, followed soon after by Sergeant Steele, of [[Wangaratta]], with six more policemen, for a total of about 30 men. Around this stage, Byrne made a toast while drinking whiskey at the bar, saying, \"Many more years in the bush for the Kelly gang!\" Moments later, a stray bullet passed through a small gap in his armour and severed his [[femoral artery]], and he bled out within minutes. Before daylight, Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and a pool of blood lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak, the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Last stand and capture===\n[[File:A strange apparition Ned Kelly's last stand.jpg|thumb|left|\"A strange apparition\": when Kelly appeared out of the mist-shrouded bush, clad in armour, bewildered policemen took him to be a ghost, a [[bunyip]], and \"[[Satan|Old Nick]] himself\".]]\nIn the dim light of dawn, Kelly, dressed in his armour and armed with three handguns, rose out of the bush and attacked the police from their rear.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=412\u2013413}} Several members of the scattered police line returned fire but to no effect as Kelly moved steadily through the morning mist towards the hotel, his armour repelling bullets. The size and shape of the armour made him appear inhuman to the police, and his apparent invulnerability caused onlookers to react with \"superstitious awe\".{{sfn|Farwell|1970|p=200}} Constable Arthur, the first policeman to encounter Kelly, recalled: \"I was completely astonished, and could not understand what the object I was firing at was.\" One trooper exclaimed that it was a [[bunyip]] and could not be killed. A civilian volunteer cried out that it was [[Satan|the Devil]]. Journalist [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]] wrote:{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=414}}\n{{quote|With the steam rising from the ground, it looked for all the world like the [[ghost (Hamlet)|ghost of Hamlet's father]] with no head, only a very long thick neck ...

Kelly, weakened by blood loss, managed to advance 50 or so yards, at times stopping to change weapons or regain his composure after taking a bullet to the armour, the sensation being \"like blows from a man's fist\".{{sfn|McMenomy|1984|p=164}} After diving to the ground to avoid one of Kelly's shots, Sergeant Steele realised that the figure's legs were unprotected. He shot at them twice with his shotgun, tearing apart Kelly's hip and thigh. The outlaw staggered, then collapsed against a fallen tree and moaned, \"I'm done, I'm done\".{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=416}} Steele went to disarm him, but Kelly fired once more, blowing the sergeant's hat off and burning the side of his face.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=417}} Several others assisted Steele in removing the armour, and expressed shock upon discovering that it was Kelly. He became quiet, shot in the left foot, left leg, right hand, left arm and twice in the region of the groin, although no bullet had penetrated his armour. He was carried to the railway station, placed in a guard's van and then taken to the stationmaster's office, where a doctor dressed his wounds.<ref name=\"DESTRUCTION\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5975546 |title=Destruction of the Kelly Gang. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 June 1880 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=151}}\n\n[[File:Kelly-Capture-Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument marking the spot of Kelly's capture]]\n\nIn the meantime the siege continued. The female hostages confirmed that Dan and Hart were still alive in the hotel. They kept shooting from the rear of the building during the morning. At 10 am, a white flag or handkerchief was held out at the front door, and immediately afterwards about 30 male hostages emerged, while Dan and Hart defended the back door. The police ordered the hostages to lie down and were checked, one by one.

The tooth was found to belong to the skull confirming it was indeed the skull recovered in 1929. In 2004, before the skull was handed to police, a cast of the skull was made and compared to the [[death mask]]s of those executed at Old Melbourne Gaol which eliminated all but two. The two were those of Kelly and Ernest Knox, who had been executed in March 1894 (headstone marked E.K., 19\u20133\u201394) and buried near Frederick Deeming (headstone marked with the initials A.W. and a D underneath). In April 1929, the skulls of the E.K. marked grave (which was thought at the time to belong to Kelly) and Frederick Deeming were looted from the excavated graves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130315308 |title=GHOULISH SCRAMBLE. |newspaper=[[The Richmond River Express and Casino Kyogle Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=17 April 1929 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> The death mask of Knox and a facial reconstruction of a cast of the skull were a close match.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1168553.htm</ref> \n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine performed a series of craniofacial super-imposition, CT scanning, anthropology and DNA tests on the skull recovered from the E.K. marked grave and concluded it was not Kelly's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vifm.org/education-and-research/the-ned-kelly-project/vifm-media-release/|title=VIFM Media Release - Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine|publisher=}}</ref> In 2014, the remains of Frederick Deeming's brother was exhumed from Bebington cemetery and tissue samples were obtained from the femur bone.

Ned Kelly's age is written as 11\u00bd.}}  was an Australian [[bushranger]], outlaw, gang leader and convicted police murderer. One of the last bushrangers, and by far the most famous, he is best known for wearing [[armour of the Kelly gang|a suit of bulletproof armour]] during his final shootout with the police.\n\nKelly was born in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as the third of eight children to Irish parents. His father, a [[Convicts in Australia|transported convict]], died shortly after serving a six-month prison sentence, leaving Kelly, then aged 12, as the eldest male of the household. The Kellys were a poor [[selection (Australian history)|selector]] family who saw themselves as downtrodden by the [[squatting (pastoral)|Squattocracy]] and as victims of persecution by the [[Victoria Police]]. While a teenager, Kelly was arrested for associating with bushranger [[Harry Power]], and served two prison terms for a variety of offences, the longest stretch being from 1871 to 1874 on a conviction of receiving a stolen horse. He later joined the \"[[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] mob\", a group of [[Australian bush|bush]] [[larrikin]]s known for stock theft. A violent confrontation with a policeman occurred at the Kelly family's home in 1878, and Kelly was indicted for his attempted murder. Fleeing to the bush, Kelly vowed to avenge his mother, who was imprisoned for her role in the incident. After he, his younger brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and two associates\u2014[[Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]]\u2014shot dead three policemen, the [[Government of Victoria]] proclaimed them [[outlaw]]s.\n\nKelly and his gang eluded the police for two years, thanks in part to the support of an extensive network of sympathisers. The gang's crime spree included raids on [[Euroa]] and [[Jerilderie]], and the killing of [[Aaron Sherritt]], a sympathiser turned police informer. In [[Jerilderie Letter|a manifesto letter]], Kelly\u2014denouncing the police, the Victorian government and the [[British Empire]]\u2014set down his own account of the events leading up to his outlawry. Demanding justice for his family and the rural poor, he threatened dire consequences against those who defied him. In 1880, when Kelly's attempt to derail and ambush a police train failed, he and his gang, dressed in armour fashioned from stolen [[plough#Parts|plough mouldboards]], engaged in a final gun battle with the police at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]]. Kelly, the only survivor, was severely wounded by police fire and captured. Despite thousands of supporters attending rallies and signing a petition for his reprieve, Kelly was tried, convicted and sentenced to [[Hanging|death by hanging]], which was carried out at the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]]. His [[last words]] were famously reported to have been, \"[[:wikt:such is life|Such is life]]\".\n\nHistorian [[Geoffrey Serle]] called Kelly and his gang \"the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to [[Melbourne]] and the world\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Serle|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Serle|title=The Rush to Be Rich: A History of the Colony of Victoria 1883\u20131889|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0-522-84009-4|page=11}}</ref> In the century after his death, Kelly became a [[cultural icon]], inspiring [[Ned Kelly in popular culture|numerous works in the arts and popular culture]], and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian.

This is a highly unusual ratio for the time, and led to claims that Kelly's family was unfairly targeted from the time they moved to northeast Victoria. Perhaps the move was necessary because of Kelly's mother's squabbles with family members and her appearances in court over family disputes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1995|p=25}}</ref> The author Antony O'Brien has argued that Victoria's colonial police practices treated arrest as equivalent to proof of guilt.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2002|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Rise to notoriety==\n===Bushranging with Harry Power===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Bushranger Harry Power.jpg\n | width1    = 138\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = [[Harry Power]] has been described as Kelly's bushranging \"mentor\".\n | image2    = Harry Power capture.jpg \n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Power's capture. Kelly was falsely accused of informing on the bushranger.\n }}\nIn 1869, aged fourteen, Kelly met Irish-born [[Harry Power]] (alias of Henry Johnson), a transported convict who turned to bushranging in North-Eastern Victoria after escaping Melbourne's [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]]. The Kellys formed part of his network of sympathisers, and by May 1869, Ned had become his bushranging prot\u00e9g\u00e9. At the end of the month, they attempted to steal horses from the [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] property of squatter John Rower as part of a plan to rob the [[Woods Point, Victoria|Woods Point]]\u2013Mansfield gold escort. They abandoned the idea and fled back into the bush after Rower shot at them, and Kelly temporarily broke off his association with Power.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nKelly's first brush with the law occurred in mid-October 1869 over an altercation between him and a Chinese pig and fowl dealer from [[Morses Creek]] named Ah Fook. According to Fook, as he passed the Kelly family home, Ned brandished a long stick and declared himself a bushranger before robbing him of 10 shillings. Fook then travelled to Benalla to give his account of what happened to Sergeant James Whelan, who was, according to fellow officers, \"a perfect encyclopedia of knowledge\" about the Kellys and their criminal activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010}} The next morning, Whelan chased down Kelly in the bush outside Greta and took him to Benalla, where he testified in court the next day that Fook abused his sister Annie for giving him creek water, not rain water, when, as a traveller, he requested a drink. Then, the story went, Fook beat Ned with a stick after he came to his sister's defence. Annie and two family-related witnesses corroborated Ned's story. Given that no other witnesses came forward, the charge was dismissed on 26 October and Kelly was released.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nKelly reconciled with Power in March 1870, and over the next month, the pair committed a series of armed robberies as police scrambled to find them and identify Power's young accomplice. By the end of April, the press had named Kelly as the culprit, and a few days later, he was captured by police and confined to [[HM Prison Beechworth|Beechworth Gaol]]. Kelly fronted court on three separate robbery charges, the first two of which were dismissed as none of the victims could positively identify him. On the third charge, the victims also reportedly failed to identify Kelly, but they were in fact refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded for trial. He was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in a lock-up before being transferred to [[Kyneton]] to face court. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of [[Police misconduct|police harassment]]; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a \"[[half-caste]]\" (a person of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] and European descent). However, the police believed this to be the result of Kelly going unwashed.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nPower often camped at Glenmore Station, a large property owned by Kelly's maternal grandfather, James Quinn, which sat at the headwaters of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]]. In June 1870, while resting in a mountainside [[humpy|gunyah]] (bark shelter) that overlooked the property, Power was captured by a police search party. Following Power's arrest, word spread within the community that Kelly had informed on him. Kelly denied the rumour, and in [[s:Ned Kelly Letter to Sgt. James Babington|a letter]] that bears the only surviving example of his handwriting, he pleads with Sergeant James Babington of Kyneton for help, saying that \"everyone looks on me like a black snake\". The informant turned out to be Kelly's uncle, Jack Lloyd, who received \u00a3500 for his assistance.\n\nReporting on Power's criminal career, the ''[[Benalla Ensign]]'' wrote:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The effect of his example has already been to draw one young fellow into the open vortex of crime, and unless his career is speedily cut short, young Kelly will blossom into a declared enemy of society.}}\n\n===Horse theft, assault and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ned Kelly aged 15.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mugshot of Kelly, aged 15]]\nIn October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused a friend of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of stealing his horse. Gould wrote an indecent note to give to McCormack's childless wife, that was used to wrap two calves's [[testicles]]. Kelly passed it to one of his cousins to give to the woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall. Kelly was arrested for his part in sending the calves' parts and the note and for assaulting McCormack. He was sentenced to three months' [[hard labour]] on each charge.\n\nKelly was released from Beechworth Gaol on 27 March 1871, five weeks early, and returned to Greta. Three weeks later, horse-breaker Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright arrived in town on what Kelly later described as a \"very remarkable\" chestnut [[mare]]. Wright visited the Kelly homestead to see his friend Alex Gunn, a Scottish miner who had married Kellys' older sister. Wright intended to ride the borrowed mare back to [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]], the home town of its owner, but discovered the next morning it had gone missing. Gunn lent him one of his own horses, promising that, if he found the mare, he would keep it until Wright returned. Soon after Wright departed, the mare was found by Gunn and a neighbour, William (Bricky) Williamson. Kelly then took the mare to [[Wangaratta]], where he stayed for four days. On 20 April 1871, while riding back into Greta, Kelly was intercepted by Constable Edward Hall, who suspected that the horse was stolen. He directed Kelly to the police station on the pretence of having to sign some papers. As Kelly dismounted, Hall tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but failed. When Kelly resisted arrest, Hall drew his revolver and tried to shoot him, but it misfired three times. He was then overpowered by Kelly, who later said that he straddled him and dug spurs into his thighs, causing the constable to \"[roar] like a big calf attacked by dogs\". After subduing Kelly with the assistance of seven bystanders, Hall [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] him until his head became \"a mass of raw and bleeding flesh\".{{sfn|FitzSimons|2013|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough Kelly maintained that he did not know the mare belonged to someone other than Wright, he and Gunn were charged with horse stealing. When it was later revealed that Kelly was still imprisoned at Beechworth Gaol when the horse was taken, the charges were downgraded to \"feloniously receiving a horse\". Kelly and Gunn were sentenced to three years imprisonment with hard labour. Wright escaped arrest for the theft on 2 May following an \"exchange of shots\" with police, but was arrested the following day at the Kelly homestead and received eighteen months for stealing the horse.\n\n[[File:Ned Kelly boxing.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelly after defeating Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright in a 20-round bare-knuckle boxing match, August 1874]] \nKelly served his sentence at Beechworth Gaol, then at [[HM Prison Pentridge]] near Melbourne. On 25 June 1873, Kelly's good behaviour earned him a transfer to the [[prison hulk]] ''Sacramento'', anchored off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. He returned to Pentridge after several months and was released on 2 February 1874, six months early for good behaviour. That same month, his mother Ellen married an American, George King, with whom she had three children. King, Kelly and Dan Kelly became involved in cattle duffing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126825077 |title=Overview of Kellyana |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=1 March 1981 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12452635|title=WE HAVE NO CATTLE \"RUSTLERS\" HERE |newspaper=[[The Argus Week-end Magazine]] |date=27 April 1940 |accessdate=6 December 2019 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTo settle the score with Wright over the chestnut mare, Kelly fought him in a bare-knuckle boxing match at the Imperial Hotel in Beechworth, 8 August 1874.

During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at [[Stringybark Creek]], \"black-balled\" him (grabbed and squeezed his [[testicle]]s).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=26}} During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said \"You should be ashamed of yourselves.\" He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly to put on the handcuffs.<ref name=\"KELLY INTERVIEWED\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70946696|title=Kelly Interviewed|date=14 August 1880|newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]|accessdate=16 June 2014|page=9|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nKelly said about the incident, \"It was in the course of this attempted arrest Fitzpatrick endeavoured to catch hold of me by the foot, and in the struggle he tore the sole and heel of my boot clean off.

As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kelly\u2019s, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. Fitzpatrick was aware of a warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing and he discussed with his sergeant at Benalla the idea of calling at the Kelly home on the way with the object of arresting Dan Kelly. The sergeant agreed with his actions, but warned him to be careful. He was instructed to proceed to Greta and rode through Wilton en route to Greta, stopping at the hotel there where he had one brandy and lemonade.\u00a0\n\nFinding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William \"Bricky\" Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kelly\u2019s).\n\nFitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and stood near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. At the same time Ellen Kelly, Ned\u2019s mother, attacked Fitzpatrick hitting him over the head with a fire shovel, knocking him senseless.\n\nFitzpatrick stated that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers, that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist, and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. \n\nOn regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped to the Winton hotel where he was assisted inside by the manager. He was offered a brandy and lemonade which he refused, but later accepted one drink. On regaining safety, he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer, when he reached Benalla accompanied by the hotel manager who rode with him.\n\n===Kelly's version of events===\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The witness which can prove Fitzpatrick's falsehood can be found by advertising and if this is not done immediately horrible disasters shall follow.

Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, \"I will blow your brains out if you interfere\". His mother replied, \"You would not be so handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here\". Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, \"There is Ned coming along by the side of the house\". While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed.\n\nKelly asserted that he was not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk when he arrived at the Kellys, that while he was waiting for Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. \n\nAfter Ned Kelly was captured, he was asked by a journalist if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said \"No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him\". Kelly also admitted to having shot Fitzpatrick after his capture. Under oath, during Kelly\u2019s trial in Melbourne, Senior Constable Kelly described a conversation he had with Ned Kelly immediately after he had been captured at Glenrowan. \u201cBetween 3 and 6 the same morning had another conversation with prisoner in the presence of Constable Ryan. Gave him some milk and water. Asked him if Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement was correct. Prisoner said, \u201cYes, I shot him\u201d.\n\n===Trial===\nWilliamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan were nowhere to be found, but Ellen was taken into custody, along with her baby, Alice. At the Benalla Court, on 17 May 1878, Williamson, Skillion and Ellen Kelly, while on remand, were charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder. The three appeared on 9 October 1878 before Judge [[Redmond Barry]] and charged with attempted murder. Despite Fitzpatrick's doctor reporting a smell of alcohol on the constable and his inability to confirm the wrist wound was caused by a bullet, Fitzpatrick's evidence was accepted by the police, the judge, and the jury. The three were convicted on Fitzpatrick's evidence. Fitzpatrick's evidence would later be corroborated by Williamson when he was interviewed in prison by Captain Frederick Standish. Mrs Kelly, Skillion and Williamson were tried and convicted of accessory to attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson both received sentences of six years and Ellen three years of hard labour. Barry stated that if Kelly were present he would \"give him 15 years\". Frank Harty, a successful and well-known farmer in the area, offered to pay Ellen Kelly's bail upon which bail was immediately refused.  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\nEllen Kelly's sentence was considered unfair even by people who had no cause to be Kelly sympathizers. Alfred Wyatt, a police magistrate headquartered in Benalla, told the commission later that \"I thought the sentence upon that old woman, Mrs Kelly, a very severe one.\" Enoch Downes, a truant officer, recounted to the commission in 1881 that while speaking to Joe Byrne's mother, he said that he did not believe in the sentence and \"if policy had been used or consideration for the mother shown that two or three months would have been ample\".  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\n==Stringybark Creek police murders==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=300\n| image1 = Bushranger Dan Kelly.jpg  |width1=157|height1=\n| image2 = SteveHart.jpg  |width2=143|height2=\n| image3 = Joe Byrne the 19th-century outlaw.jpg  |width3=177|height3=\n| footer = Greta mob members [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]] (left), [[Steve Hart]] (centre) and [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] (right) took to bushranging with Ned Kelly after the Fitzpatrick incident.\n}}\n\n[[File:Mansfield-police-photomontage.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Constable Lonigan, Sergeant Kennedy, Constable McIntyre and Constable Scanlan.]]\n[[File:MansfieldKellyMonument.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument erected in [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] in 1880 in honour of the policemen murdered at Stringybark Creek]]\nAfter the sentences were handed down in Benalla Police Court, both Ned and Dan Kelly doubted that they could convince the police of their story.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=44}} So they went into hiding, where they were later joined by friends [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]].\n\nThe police had received information that the Kelly gang were in the Wombat Ranges, at the head of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]].

At about noon Lonigan heard a strange noise down by the creek and McIntyre went to investigate, hoping that it could be some [[kangaroo]]s that he could shoot for dinner. Instead, he shot and killed some [[parrot]]s which he cooked for dinner. (Unaware at the time, the sound of the shots alerted the bushrangers to their location.) At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, \"Bail up, hold up your arms\". McIntyre testified that Kelly took his [[fowling piece]], and that all the gang members were armed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114524063 |title=Trail of Ned Kelly.

Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed.  Almost immediately Kelly shifted his aim from McIntyre to Lonigan and fired.  Kelly shot him in the temple.<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> He fell to the ground and said, \"Oh Christ, I am shot\". He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, \"What a pity; what made the fool run?\"<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives:\n{{quote|I told [Kelly] that they were both countrymen and co-religionists of his own. ... I thought he might be possessed of some of that patriotic-religious feeling which is such a bond of sympathy amongst the Irish people. My opinion is that he possessed none of this feeling.

A favourite expression of his was: 'I will let them see what one native [native-born Australian] can do.'}}\n\nMcIntyre asked whether he was to be shot. Kelly replied, \"No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?\" He added, \"At first I thought you were Constable Flood.

It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen\".\n\nMcIntyre asked what they would do if he induced his comrades to surrender. Kelly stated, \"I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands\", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, \"You can depend on us\". Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly \"lagged\" at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114522713 |title=Prosecution of Ned Kelly. |newspaper=[[The Manaro Mercury, and Cooma and Bombala Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=11 August 1880 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stringybark attack.jpg|thumb|left|The Kelly gang prepares to open fire as Kennedy and Scanlan arrive.

They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, \"Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm\". Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, \"Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded\". Kelly at the same time called out, \"Put up your hands\". Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, \"It's all right, stop it, stop it\". Scanlan's horse was disturbed and he tried to dismount but fell to the ground, and was on all fours. As he rose Kelly shot him in the right chest killing him almost instantly.  \n\nThis account has been disputed by the great grandson of Sergeant Kennedy, who claims the story has been altered down the years in order to embellish the Kelly myth. He claims Kennedy was wounded twice in a hopeless fight, captured, and then murdered two hours later. by Kelly shooting him at point blank range with a shotgun to the chest. Kelly then robbed the corpse of a gold watch, a notebook and some coins.\n\nMcIntyre, believing that the gang intended to shoot the whole party,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\" /> fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available.

Suffering from a severe fall during his escape and with his clothes in tatters, McIntyre concealed himself in a [[wombat]] hole until dark, taking note of the direction of the setting sun. At about midnight, he set about to strike the Benalla road by trekking west, guided by a star. After crossing a number of streams, his feet became chafed, and had to walk with one of his boots off. After a rest, and using a match to illuminate a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farmhouse outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon. He then travelled by buggy to Mansfield and then directly to the residence of Sub-Inspector Pewtress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5919040 |title=The Police Murders |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=30 October 1878 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTwo hours after McIntyre reported the murder of the troopers, Pewtress set out for camp, accompanied by McIntyre, Constable Allwood, Dr Reynolds, and five townspeople.

There they found the bodies of Scanlan and Lonigan, as well as the tent burnt and possessions looted or destroyed. The post-mortem, by Dr Reynolds, showed that Lonigan had received four wounds, one through the eyeball.

Earlier, he brushed off warnings that the place was held up by the Kelly gang, and when accosted by Ned, responded angrily and attempted to get a revolver from his wagon. Ned threatened to shoot him, saying it would be easy to do so if the hawker \"did not keep a civil tongue in his head\". Gloster asked the bushranger who he was. He responded: \"I am Ned Kelly, the son of Red Kelly, and a better man never stood in two shoes.\" McCauley persuaded Gloster to surrender, and the pair joined the other prisoners in the storeroom. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=67}} Time passed quietly until 2 am, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Hart and Byrne rushed from the building.

The bank having closed before their arrival, Ned forced the clerk to open it and cash the cheque.

By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for [[Wagga Wagga]]. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], so they took off in that direction but later gave up their chase. On their return home, they passed through [[Jerilderie]], and the gang then decided to rob the bank.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72558543 |title=TALE: By a Resident of Coonamble |newspaper=[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]] |location=NSW |date=5 January 1889 |accessdate=1 November 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAccording to J.J. Kenneally, however, the gang arrived at Jerilderie having crossed the [[Murray River]] at [[Burramine]]. The group had heard of a crossing there, from where they could swim their horses but did not know where the landing place was on the opposite side of the river, so had [[Tom Lloyd (Australia)|Tom Lloyd]] investigate (the river was guarded by border police). After unsuccessfully trying to cross on his own, Lloyd employed the help of an owner of a hotel nearby, who pulled him across in a boat with Lloyd's horse paddling behind. After reporting the trip back to the rest of the gang, the group appropriated the boat to get across in two trips. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart reached Davidson's Hotel two miles south of Jerilderie on Saturday 2 February 1879 in time for tea, while the others waited in another area.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nAt about midnight on 8 February, the gang surrounded the Jerilderie Police Station. Ned rode to the front and shouted for the policemen to come out, claiming there was a drunken brawl at Davidson's Hotel. Constables George Devine and Henry Richards emerged and asked the stranger for more information. Once Ned established there were no other policemen inside, the gang held them up and locked them in a cell.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}} Mary, Devine's wife, and their children were kept hostage inside the house as Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition. After this, he let them return to sleep, and with the rest of the gang stayed in the dining room until morning.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThere was a chapel in the courthouse, 100 yards from the barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied by one of the Kellys. At about 10&nbsp;am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=90}} When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the door was closed and the blinds pulled to give the impression that the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.\n\nOn Monday morning Byrne brought two horses to be shod, but the blacksmith suspected something strange in his manner,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} so he noted the horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith was struck by the quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=91}} About 10&nbsp;am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, \"The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered for the rest of his life\".{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=92\u201393}} Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.\n\nAfter the manager had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living back to the bank and asked him how much money they had. Living admitted to between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, \u00a3691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered \"No\". Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found \u00a31650, making for a total of \u00a32141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing mortgage documents, in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=93}}<ref>Seal, Graham.

He then placed his revolver on the bar and announced, \"Anyone here may take it and shoot me dead, but if I'm shot, Jerilderie shall swim in its own blood.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010}} As the hotel's \"roughs\" cheered Kelly on, he learned that Hart had earlier stolen a watch from a local Methodist clergyman, Reverend J.

The police used the house of her neighbour, former Greta mob member and lifelong friend of Byrne, [[Aaron Sherritt]], as a base of operations, sleeping in it during the day and keeping watch from nearby caves at night. Sherritt accepted police payments for camping with the watch parties and for providing information on the bushrangers' activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=}} While many policemen suspected him of being a [[double agent]] for the gang, a detective, [[Michael Edward Ward|Michael Ward]], planned to bring the bushrangers out of hiding by spreading rumours that Sherritt's true loyalties lay with the police.{{sfn|Kelson|McQuilton|2001|p=128}} Convinced that he was a traitor, the gang decided to murder Sherritt as part of their own plan, one that they boasted would \"astonish not only the Australian colonies, but the whole world\".{{sfn|Farwell|1970|p=193}}\n\n[[File:MurderOfSherritt.jpg|thumb|left|Murder of Sherritt]]\nOn 26 June 1880, Dan and Byrne rode into the Woolshed Valley.

While Dan went to the front door of Sherritt's hut, Byrne forced Wick to knock on the back door and call out. \"What do you want?\" asked Sherritt. Prompted by Byrne, Wick replied that he had lost his way. Sherritt opened the door and joked with his neighbour as Belle Sherritt, his wife, told him to give directions. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way, he hesitated, saying, \"Who's that?\" Byrne then fired two shots and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the neck, severing his jugular.

They also surmised that the train would collect reinforcements in [[Benalla]] before continuing through [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]], a small town in the [[Warby Ranges]]. There, the gang planned to wreck the train and shoot dead any survivors, then ride to an unpoliced Benalla where they would rob the banks, set fire to the courthouse, blow up the police barracks, release anyone imprisoned in the gaol, and \"generally play havoc with the entire town\" before returning to the bush.{{sfn|Dawson|2018|pp=57\u201358}} While Byrne and Dan were in the Woolshed Valley, Ned and Hart tried, but failed, to damage the track at Glenrowan, so they forced line-repairers camped nearby to finish the job.

Believing that Curnow was a sympathiser, Ned let him and his wife return home, but warned them to \"go quietly to bed and not to dream too loud\", as one of the gang would visit during the night. Back at the hotel, Kelly grew increasingly anxious over the train's non-arrival. The delay was caused by the fact that the policemen in Sherritt's hut waited until daylight to emerge and give the alarm, and news of the murder did not reach Melbourne until Sunday afternoon. Only at 1 am on Monday did a police train carrying troopers, [[Australian native police|native trackers]] and several journalists steam into Benalla to collect reinforcements. Upon hearing the train's approach at 3 am, Curnow, despite Kelly's warning, rushed to the line and warned the pilot train to stop by raising a lit candle behind a red scarf. He told the driver of the gang's plan. The trains then slowly made their way to Glenrowan.\n\nAround this time, Kelly decided to let the townspeople return home, but Ann Jones told them to stay to hear the outlaw lecture. Byrne interrupted the conversation, alerting the group about the train's arrival. The gang prepared for action and hurried to dress in their armour. Bracken meanwhile told the hostages to lie low, and escaped to the railway station to explain the situation to the police. Superintendent Hare led six constables and five native trackers towards the hotel where the armour-clad outlaws waited for them on the verandah. As the police approached the police commander Superintendent Hare noticed a single figure standing on the verandah, who immediately opened fire on the police. The police returned fire and the other three gang members all dressed in their armour joined Ned Kelly. In the first volley, Supt Hare was hit in the left wrist, and Ned Kelly was wounded in the left hand and arm and he received a shot to his right foot that entered at the toes and exited at his heel.\n\n{{Wide image|Glenrowan shootout.jpg|700px|The gang and police exchange gunfire. Drawing by [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], one of several journalists present during the battle.}}\n\nThe police and the gang fired at each other for about a quarter of an hour. During a lull, Superintendent Hare returned to the railway station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, and [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], artist for the ''[[Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil|Australasian Sketcher]]'', used his handkerchief to compress the wound. Hare then ordered O'Connor and his men to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to battle, but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be sent to Benalla for treatment. \n\nThe Royal Commission found that Ned Kelly having retreated into the hotel after the first volley almost certainly walked out the back door for about 150 metres leading his horse. At about 100 metres he dropped his rifle and continued where he lay down behind a log until just after 7 am in the morning.\n\nThe police, trackers and civilian volunteers surrounded the hotel throughout the night, and the firing continued intermittently. At about 5 am, nine reinforcements under Superintendent Sadleir arrived from Benalla, followed soon after by Sergeant Steele, of [[Wangaratta]], with six more policemen, for a total of about 30 men. Around this stage, Byrne made a toast while drinking whiskey at the bar, saying, \"Many more years in the bush for the Kelly gang!\" Moments later, a stray bullet passed through a small gap in his armour and severed his [[femoral artery]], and he bled out within minutes. Before daylight, Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and a pool of blood lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak, the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Last stand and capture===\n[[File:A strange apparition Ned Kelly's last stand.jpg|thumb|left|\"A strange apparition\": when Kelly appeared out of the mist-shrouded bush, clad in armour, bewildered policemen took him to be a ghost, a [[bunyip]], and \"[[Satan|Old Nick]] himself\".]]\nIn the dim light of dawn, Kelly, dressed in his armour and armed with three handguns, rose out of the bush and attacked the police from their rear.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=412\u2013413}} Several members of the scattered police line returned fire but to no effect as Kelly moved steadily through the morning mist towards the hotel, his armour repelling bullets.

The Book explains the pointers by Naradmuni to Prithvi who is completely deprieved of its own virtues, the whole book  thereafter is a detailed question and answer between Shukdev ji and Maharaj Parikshit who is about to be killed by venom of serpent king Takshak, due to curse from son of Rishi.\n\nThe Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapuran covers concepts of universal formation , atom and its structures , outlining and description of earth, description of various major kings and dynasties from Bharat to kalki, references to various beahviours in Ramayan, Mahabharat, Krishna Rassleela in chapter 10 and thereafter a very detailed philosophy of life and virtues of this world.\n\nWhile the TV serial  potrays it in a complete different light, it should by no means be seen as a mere discussion between Radha and Krishna, in reality the discussion between Radha and Krishan ( Krish Raas section) is only a very limited part of it and can be seen as the last test, before the path to true knowledge is opened.{{Infobox television\n| show_name          = Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapuran\n| image              =\n| image_alt          = \n| show_name_2        =\n| genre              = [[Mythological]] <br> [[Drama]]\n| creator            = [[Nikhil Dwivedi]]\n| developer          = [[Nikhil Dwivedi]]\n| based_on           = {{plainlist|\n* [[Bhagavad Gita]]\n* [[Mahabharata]]\n* [[Ramayana]]\n}}\n| writer             = [[Vikas Kapoor]]\n| director           = [[Nikhil Dwivedi]]\n| creative_director = \n| starring         = [[Rajneesh Duggal]] <br> [[Shiny Doshi]]\n| narrated           =\n| opentheme          = ''Shirmad Bhagwat'' \u2013 song\n| endtheme           = ''Shrimad Bhagwat'' \u2013 music\n| composer           = \n| country            = [[India]]\n| language           = [[Hindi]]\n| num_seasons        = 1\n| num_episodes       = 47 <!-- as of 19 April 2020 --><!-- Do not uncomment the preceding text.

Recently, there have been findings of fossils in the north to northeast of Madagascar. Reconstructions indicate that the extinct lemurs did not climb very often and imply that they were much more adept at terrestrial living, more than any other extant strepsirrhhine. They are not believed to have been exclusively terrestrial, but rather to have had a combined habitat of ground and arboreal life. A modest degree of curvature found in the remains support this idea. The hands and feet are very robust and large in size, but are very short, and said to be closer to the likeness of a baboon's hand. The hind-limbs are also known to be short, which implies that the hands and feet are relatively short for the lemur's body weight.''Archaeolemur'' is unique in the combination of post-cranial features. The overall look of the lemur, beyond just the hands and feet, was a relatively short and stocky one which gave them limited leaping abilities. This indicates that the ''Archaeolemur'' may have ranged over wide landscapes, which is consistent with its subfossil distribution over much of Madagascar. This implies they had a high tolerance for broad habitats. They are thought to be omnivores from the fossilized droppings of a younger individual. An imaging technique shows pictures of the mandibles, showing the bone structure of the mouth. Further studies on their enamel indicate that ''Archaeolemur'' also had the ability to exploit resources that may have been indigestible to other species, showing a great plasticity in their dietary tracts as well. This may have helped ''Archaeolemur'' persist after the arrival of humans in Madagascar, as it was one of the last subfossil lemurs to become extinct.\n\n''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' is the only species of the genus ''Hadropithecus'', and is commonly referred to as the \"baboon lemur\". The species was discovered in Madagascar in the year 1899 by a renowned paleontologist by the name of Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau, who associated the monkey lemurs with apes. Three years later, in 1902, Liburnau classified ''Hadropithecus'' as a lemur. Liburnau continued to make distinctions by reconstruction of certain skulls which reaffirmed that the monkey lemurs are a sister family to sloth lemurs. In an article analyzing the dental microwear of the Archaeolemuridae, some important information was discovered through fossilized teeth. This in turn helped distinguish between certain characteristics of the monkey lemurs compared to [[Megaladapis|megaladapids]]. The two families occasionally had similar diets, observed from the overlapping textures of their dental microwear. However, the two families\u2019 dental microwear differed at some points, indicating that archaeolemurids had a diet containing a variety of harder foods.\n''H. stenognathus'' possessed similar cranial stricture and dental portions to hominins.  Carbon isotope data show that they consumed CAM or C4 plants. The prior assumption that ''H. stenognathus'' ate C3 plants which included large seeds and hard fruits were wrong because those foods were too strong for the animal's teeth.  Testing the carbon samples along southern and southwestern Madagascar where ''H. stenognathus'' once lived and was endemic to, scientists found high values of carbon isotopes tied to the C4 and CAM groups of plants.  The large teeth were meant to extract the nutrients from food that needed incisional, but not tough preparation.\n\n''H. stenognathus'' was well-suited to processing large amounts of small and/or flat, displacement-limited foods, rather than a previously thought diet of resistant, stress-limited foods. The species lived in environments in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where it is thought to have consumed bulbs and corms of grasses and sedges comprising the bulk of its diet. \n''H. stenognathus'' may have survived until the late 1st Millennium CE. It was driven to extinction mainly by human activity, like many other lemurs of Madagascar. However, it became extinct sooner than ''Archaeolemur'', its sister genus. The last known record of ''Hadropithecus'' was dated to around 444-772 CE. It is believed that ''Hadropithecus'' was a relatively rare lemur, based on a lower number of subfossils recorded. Similar to the sloth lemur, Hadropithecus was a large, slow, specialized lemur, that grazed and fed on seeds. ''Archaeolemur'' was more generalized, which may have allowed it to persist longer. Although it is not completely verified, ''Hadropithecus'''s large body and large brain, compared to other species, has led to the belief that it would have reproduced fairly slowly, making it more susceptible to extinction. The low reproductive rate goes hand in hand with weaning age - ''Hadropithecus'' would not have weaned its young before 2.75 years of age, or even 3 years,giving it one of the slowest life cycles of any lemur. It is believed that ''Hadropithecus'' would have not given birth more than once every other year. In addition, ''Hadropithecus'' would have spent most, if not all, of its time on the ground, making it readily available for hunting and exploitation by humans. It not only would have faced pressure from humans, but also from domestic livestock, which were grazers as well. Though it could have climbed trees, it lacked adaptation for suspension or leaping.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = J | year = 2009 | title = Dental microwear texture analysis of two families of subfossil lemurs from Madagascar | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution| volume =  56| issue = | pages =  405\u2013416| doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.11.003 }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0805195105 | volume=105 | title=A reconstruction of the Vienna skull of Hadropithecus stenognathus | year=2008 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pages=10699\u201310702  | last1 = Ryan | first1 = T.

The prior assumption that ''H. stenognathus'' ate C3 plants which included large seeds and hard fruits were wrong because those foods were too strong for the animal's teeth.  Testing the carbon samples along southern and southwestern Madagascar where ''H. stenognathus'' once lived and was endemic to, scientists found high values of carbon isotopes tied to the C4 and CAM groups of plants.  The large teeth were meant to extract the nutrients from food that needed incisional, but not tough preparation.\n\n''H. stenognathus'' was well-suited to processing large amounts of small and/or flat, displacement-limited foods, rather than a previously thought diet of resistant, stress-limited foods. The species lived in environments in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where it is thought to have consumed bulbs and corms of grasses and sedges comprising the bulk of its diet. \n''H. stenognathus'' may have survived until the late 1st Millennium CE. It was driven to extinction mainly by human activity, like many other lemurs of Madagascar. However, it became extinct sooner than ''Archaeolemur'', its sister genus. The last known record of ''Hadropithecus'' was dated to around 444-772 CE. It is believed that ''Hadropithecus'' was a relatively rare lemur, based on a lower number of subfossils recorded. Similar to the sloth lemur, Hadropithecus was a large, slow, specialized lemur, that grazed and fed on seeds. ''Archaeolemur'' was more generalized, which may have allowed it to persist longer. Although it is not completely verified, ''Hadropithecus'''s large body and large brain, compared to other species, has led to the belief that it would have reproduced fairly slowly, making it more susceptible to extinction. The low reproductive rate goes hand in hand with weaning age - ''Hadropithecus'' would not have weaned its young before 2.75 years of age, or even 3 years,giving it one of the slowest life cycles of any lemur. It is believed that ''Hadropithecus'' would have not given birth more than once every other year. In addition, ''Hadropithecus'' would have spent most, if not all, of its time on the ground, making it readily available for hunting and exploitation by humans. It not only would have faced pressure from humans, but also from domestic livestock, which were grazers as well. Though it could have climbed trees, it lacked adaptation for suspension or leaping.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Scott, J. (2009, April 1).
