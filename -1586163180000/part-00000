Successful animator [[Walt Disney]] was looking to create a weekly television series, along with creating a theme park that would ultimately become [[Disneyland]], with its own [[Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series#Walt_Disney's_Disneyland_(1954\u20131958)|anthology series]]. While all three major networks showed interest, Disney ultimately chose to partner with ABC, who was the only network willing to finance the theme park and ABC ended up owning 1/3rd of it. Creative differences between Disney and ABC, along with Walt's brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]] insisting on buying back ABC's share of Disneyland would lead to an initial lawsuit by Roy Disney against ABC in 1959 for [[breach of contract]]. In 1960, both sides settled and Disney acquired ABC's share in Disneyland for $7.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Korkis |first1=Jim |title=ABC and Disneyland 1955 |url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/11056/ABC_and_Disneyland_1955 |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Glover |first1=Erin |title=\u2018Disneyland\u2019 Television Show Sets the Stage for Walt Disney\u2019s Dream |url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/04/disneyland-television-show-sets-the-stage-for-walt-disneys-dream/ |website=Disney Parks Blog |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Cities/ABC===\n[[File:Capital Cities ABC, Inc. logo.png|thumb|The ABC Television Group logo before merging with [[The Walt Disney Company]].]]\nIn 1993, DiC Animation City and [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities/ABC]] formed a joint venture called DIC Entertainment L.P.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Lowry |url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/dic-ent-formed-for-kids-tv-fare-108945/ |title=DIC Ent. formed for kids TV fare |publisher=Variety |date=July 26, 1993 |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===ABC Group===\nIn 1996, Disney acquired [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]], and initially re-branded the holding media conglomerate as ABC Group.

Successful animator [[Walt Disney]] was looking to create a weekly television series, along with creating a theme park that would ultimately become [[Disneyland]], with its own [[Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series#Walt_Disney's_Disneyland_(1954\u20131958)|anthology series]]. While all three major networks showed interest, Disney ultimately chose to partner with ABC, who was the only network willing to finance the theme park and ABC ended up owning 1/3rd of it. Creative differences between Disney and ABC, along with Walt's brother [[Roy Disney|Roy]] insisting on buying back ABC's share of Disneyland would lead to an initial lawsuit by Roy Disney against ABC in 1959 for [[breach of contract]]. In 1960, both sides settled and Disney acquired ABC's share in Disneyland for $7.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Korkis |first1=Jim |title=ABC and Disneyland 1955 |url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/11056/ABC_and_Disneyland_1955 |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Glover |first1=Erin |title=\u2018Disneyland\u2019 Television Show Sets the Stage for Walt Disney\u2019s Dream |url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/04/disneyland-television-show-sets-the-stage-for-walt-disneys-dream/ |website=Disney Parks Blog |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Cities/ABC===\n[[File:Capital Cities ABC, Inc. logo.png|thumb|The ABC Television Group logo before merging with [[The Walt Disney Company]].]]\nIn 1993, DiC Animation City and [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities/ABC]] formed a joint venture called DIC Entertainment L.P.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Lowry |url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/dic-ent-formed-for-kids-tv-fare-108945/ |title=DIC Ent. formed for kids TV fare |publisher=Variety |date=July 26, 1993 |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===ABC Group===\nIn 1996, Disney acquired [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]], and initially re-branded the holding media conglomerate as ABC Group.

Rawana requested the Lord Shiva to go to Lanka with him and leave Himalaya forever. The Lord Shiva agreed to go on condition that he should not be placed anywhere on the way to Lanka. If he were placed anywhere, he would settle at that place. Rawana agreed and started his journey to Lanka with the Lord on his head. When Rawana reached the Gola Gokaran Nath (then called Gollihara) he felt the need to urinate (a call of nature). Rawana offered some gold coins to a shepherd (who was none other than Lord Ganesha sent by deities) for placing the Lord Shiva on his head until he returned. The shepherd (Lord Ganesha) placed him on the land. Rawana failed to lift him up despite all his efforts. He pressed him on his head with his thumb in full anger.

More areas were reserved for protection between 1867 and 1879 and added to the Division. The area of the Division was legally constituted as Reserved Forests in 1937.\n[[File:Sharda Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Sharda Dam]]\nThe Sonaripur Sanctuary, comprising 15.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, was created in 1958 to specifically protect swamp deer (Cervus duvaceli duvaceli).

It is the belief of the people that Lord Shiva was pleased with the penance (Tapasya) of Rawana (King of Lanka) and offered him a boon. Rawana requested the Lord Shiva to go to Lanka with him and leave Himalaya forever. The Lord Shiva agreed to go on condition that he should not be placed anywhere on the way to Lanka. If he were placed anywhere, he would settle at that place. Rawana agreed and started his journey to Lanka with the Lord on his head. When Rawana reached the Gola Gokaran Nath (then called Gollihara) he felt the need to urinate (a call of nature). Rawana offered some gold coins to a shepherd (who was none other than Lord Ganesha sent by deities) for placing the Lord Shiva on his head until he returned. The shepherd (Lord Ganesha) placed him on the land. Rawana failed to lift him up despite all his efforts. He pressed him on his head with his thumb in full anger. The impression of Rawana's thumb is still present on the Shivling. In the month of Chatra (April) a great fair is organised for one month known as ''Cheti-Mela''.\n\n===Sankata Devi Mandir===\nSankata Devi Mandir is also located in Lakhimpur.\n\n===Frog Temple===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:Frogtemple5.jpg|thumb|left|Frog temple]]\nThe unique Frog Temple lies at Oel town, {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} from Lakhimpur on the route from Lakhimpur to Sitapur.

Towards the end of the 17th century, Chand Rajas again attacked Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688, Udyot Chand, erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwar and Parbateshwar, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti, the Parbateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple.[2] Gyan Chand, the king of kumaon ascended the throne in 1698. In 1699 he attacked Garhwal, which was under the king Fateh Shah. He crossed Ramganga river and plundered Sabli, Khatli, and Sainchar. In 1701, Fateh shah entered in Chaukot (now Syalde region with 3 part, Talla Chaukot (lower), Malla Chaukot (Upper) and Bichla Chaukot (middle)) and Gewar valley (region of Chaukhutiya, Masi, and Dwarahat) as reply. The Kumaonis defeated the Garhwalis in the battle of Duduli (near Melchauri in Garhwal). In 1707, the Kumaon forces annexed Juniyagarh in Bichla Chaukot (Syalde), and razed the old fort at Chandpur. Later, Jagat Chand (1708\u201320), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar, and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin. However, a subsequent king of Garhwal, Pradip Shah (1717\u201372), regained control over Garhwal and retained Doon till 1757, when Rohilla leader, Najib-ud-Daula, established himself there, though he was ousted soon by Pradip Shah.\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = centre\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Kingdom of Kumaon\n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Kumaon (Som Chand).png\n| width1    = 200\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Som Chand\t(700-721)\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Kumaon (Gyan Chand).png\n| width2    = 200\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Garur Gyan Chand (1374-1419)\n\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Kumaon (Kirti Chand).png\n| width3    = 200\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Kirti Chand (1488-1503)\n\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    = Kumaon (Kayan Chand).png\n| width4    = 200\n| alt4      = \n| caption4  = Balo Kalyan Chand (1560-1568)\n\n<!-- Image 5 -->\n| image5    = Kumaon (Rudra Chand).png\n| width5    = 200\n| alt5      = \n| caption5  = Rudra Chand (1568-1597)\n}}\n\n===Kumaon Province===\n[[File:Almora Bazaar. c1860.jpg|thumb|Almora Bazaar, c1860]]\nIn 1791, the [[Gorkha]]s of [[Nepal]] expanding their empire westwards across [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]], invaded Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom and other parts of the kingdom.

In 1701, Fateh shah entered in Chaukot (now Syalde region with 3 part, Talla Chaukot (lower), Malla Chaukot (Upper) and Bichla Chaukot (middle)) and Gewar valley (region of Chaukhutiya, Masi, and Dwarahat) as reply. The Kumaonis defeated the Garhwalis in the battle of Duduli (near Melchauri in Garhwal). In 1707, the Kumaon forces annexed Juniyagarh in Bichla Chaukot (Syalde), and razed the old fort at Chandpur. Later, Jagat Chand (1708\u201320), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar, and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin. However, a subsequent king of Garhwal, Pradip Shah (1717\u201372), regained control over Garhwal and retained Doon till 1757, when Rohilla leader, Najib-ud-Daula, established himself there, though he was ousted soon by Pradip Shah.\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = centre\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Kingdom of Kumaon\n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Kumaon (Som Chand).png\n| width1    = 200\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Som Chand\t(700-721)\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Kumaon (Gyan Chand).png\n| width2    = 200\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Garur Gyan Chand (1374-1419)\n\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Kumaon (Kirti Chand).png\n| width3    = 200\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Kirti Chand (1488-1503)\n\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    = Kumaon (Kayan Chand).png\n| width4    = 200\n| alt4      = \n| caption4  = Balo Kalyan Chand (1560-1568)\n\n<!-- Image 5 -->\n| image5    = Kumaon (Rudra Chand).png\n| width5    = 200\n| alt5      = \n| caption5  = Rudra Chand (1568-1597)\n}}\n\n===Kumaon Province===\n[[File:Almora Bazaar. c1860.jpg|thumb|Almora Bazaar, c1860]]\nIn 1791, the [[Gorkha]]s of [[Nepal]] expanding their empire westwards across [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]], invaded Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom and other parts of the kingdom. The Gorkhas were defeated by the [[East India Company]] in [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] and were forced to cede Kumaon to the British as part of the [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816. The Kumaon region was joined with the eastern half of the Garhwal region and was governed as a chief-commissionership, also known as the Kumaon Province, on the non-regulation system.<ref>Robert Montgomery Martin, ''History of the Possessions of the Honourable East India Company,'' Volume 1, pg. 107</ref> In seventy years it was governed by three successive administrators: Mr. Traill, Mr J.
