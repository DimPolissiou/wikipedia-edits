The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-5, is the current authority for psychiatric diagnosis in the United States. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder falls under the category of [[anxiety disorder]]s in the DSM-5, and not the category of substance-related and addictive disorders, even though the symptoms are due to the effects of a substance.<ref name=\"DSM5\">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8 |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/226 226\u2013230] |url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/226 }}</ref>\n\nDiagnosis according to the DSM-5 is dependent on various criteria. Patients must present symptoms of either panic attacks or anxiety. There must also be evidence that the panic or anxiety symptoms are a direct result of the use of the intoxicating substance. In caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, such symptoms would be due to the consumption of caffeine. The DSM-5 makes the distinction that the substance must be physiologically capable of leading to the anxiety and panic symptoms. This establishes the relationship between the abused chemical agent and the observed clinical effects. Caffeine has been proven to act as an antagonist on adenosine receptors, which acts as a stimulant and therefore fulfills this criteria. Symptoms must also not have a more likely clinical cause, such as another type of anxiety disorder, come before the ingestion of the intoxicating substance, or last for an extended amount of time after stopping the use of the substance. Diagnosis also requires that the panic attacks or anxiety due to the use of the intoxicating substance cause a certain amount of disturbance in the patient or lead to deficiency of varying types of daily performance.<ref name=\"DSM5\" />\n\n===Diagnostic features===\nIn addition to the criteria above, it is important to recognize that the diagnostic criteria for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are not met if the symptoms of panic come before the intoxication by the substance. In caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, a diagnosis will not be made if symptoms of anxiety or panic precede the ingestion of caffeine. Also, if symptoms persist for more than one month after substance intoxication, the diagnosis cannot be made. Persistence and continuation of symptoms beyond the initial consumption of caffeine suggest an alternate diagnosis that would better explain the long-lasting symptoms. Anxiety symptoms caused by caffeine are often mistaken for serious mental disorders including [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], leaving patients medicated for the wrong issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Torres|first=Francis M.|date=April 2009|title=Caffeine - Induced Psychiatric Disorders|url=http://www.americanmedtech.org/files/STEP_Online_articles/353.pdf|journal=Journal of Continuing Education Topics & Issues|doi=|pmid=|access-date=22 February 2016}}</ref> A caffeine-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made, rather than a substance abuse or intoxication diagnosis, when symptoms of panic attacks or anxiety predominate.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Prevalence===\nAlthough exact rates of prevalence are not available, general population data shows a 0.002% prevalence over a year-long period and higher prevalence within clinical populations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Caffeine==\n[[File:Caffeine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|180x180px|Caffeine structure]]\nCaffeine is a [[Xanthine|methylxanthine]], and is hydrophobic.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last=Fredholm |first=B.

Absorption in the gastrointestinal tract reaches near completion at about 99% after only 45&nbsp;minutes. [[Half-life]] of caffeine for most adults is between 2.5 and 4.5&nbsp;hours when consumption is limited to less than 10&nbsp;mg/kg. However, during neonatal development, half-life for the fetus is significantly longer and decreases exponentially after birth to reach a normal rate at about 6 months.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P-450]], a [[hemeprotein]], acts in liver [[microsome]]s to metabolize caffeine into dimethylxanthines, monomethylxanthines, dimethyl uric acids, monomethyl uric acids, trimethylallantoin, dimethylallantoin, and derivatives of [[uracil]]. Most caffeine is metabolized by 3-methyl demethylation, forming the metabolite of [[paraxanthine]]. Many metabolites, in addition to caffeine, act within the body and are partly responsible for the physiological response to caffeine.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Mechanism of caffeine action==\nCaffeine acts in multiple ways within the brain and the rest of the body. However, due to the concentration of caffeine required, [[Receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of [[adenosine]] receptors is the primary mode of action.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" /> The following mechanisms are ways in which caffeine may act within the body, but depending on necessary caffeine concentration and other factors may not be responsible for the clinical effects of the substance.\n\n===Mobilization of intracellular calcium===\nAt very high concentrations of about 1\u20132 [[Molar concentration|mM]], caffeine lowers the excitability threshold in muscle cells, leading to prolonged contraction. The introduction of such high doses of caffeine allows calcium to enter the muscle cell through the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] more readily. Influx of calcium through the membranes in muscle cells requires at least 250 \u03bcM of caffeine. Normally, other toxic effects of caffeine begin to occur in concentrations over 200&nbsp;\u03bcM, however average consumption averages lead to concentrations less than 100&nbsp;\u03bcM. This means that calcium influx and mobilization are most likely not the cause of caffeine's effect on the central nervous system, and are therefore not the cause of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" />\n\n===Inhibition of phosphodiesterases===\nMethylxanthines such as caffeine inhibit the action of [[cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase]], which normally acts to break down [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, is a second messenger important in many cellular processes and is a critical factor in [[signal transduction]]. The inhibition of the phosphodiesterase would lead to a buildup of cAMP, increasing the activity of the second messenger throughout the cell. Though this mechanism is possible, it only occurs after levels of caffeine have reached a toxic level, and therefore it is unlikely to explain the mechanism of caffeine in the brain.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" />\n\n===Antagonism of adenosine receptors===\nThere are four well-known [[adenosine receptor]]s found in the body, [[Adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]], [[Adenosine A2A receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]], [[Adenosine A2B receptor|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[Adenosine A3 receptor|A<sub>3</sub>]]. The endogenous agonist for these receptors is [[adenosine]], which is a [[Purine|purine nucleoside]] that is important for processes such as energy transfer in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) and signal transduction in the form of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP). A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors require concentrations of caffeine that do not occur at normal physiological levels or with normal levels of caffeine consumption in order to be antagonized, and will therefore not be considered as a possible mechanism for caffeine-induced anxiety.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCaffeine acts as an antagonist of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Adenosine is a normal [[Neuromodulation|neuromodulator]] that activates adenosine [[G protein\u2013coupled receptor|g-protein coupled receptors]]. The actions of A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors oppose each other but are both inhibited by caffeine due to its function as an antagonist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA<sub>2A</sub> receptors are coupled to G<sub>s</sub> proteins which activate [[Adenylyl cyclase|adenylate cyclase]] and some [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]]. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are located in [[dopamine]] rich brain regions. A<sub>2A</sub> receptor mRNA was found in the same neurons as the dopamine receptor [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]] within the [[Striatum|dorsal striatum]], [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[Olfactory tubercle|tuberculum olfactorium]]. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are not found in neurons that express the dopamine receptor [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]] receptors and [[Substance P]]. Within the striatum, part of the basal ganglia, activation of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors by adenosine increases [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] release, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When caffeine binds to the receptor, less inhibitory neurotransmitter is released, supporting caffeine's role as a central nervous system stimulant.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA<sub>1</sub> receptors are paired with the G-proteins of [[G protein\u2013coupled receptor|G<sub>i-1</sub>, G<sub>i-2</sub>, G<sub>i-3</sub>, G<sub>o1</sub>, and G<sub>o2</sub>]]. The g-proteins of A<sub>1</sub> receptors continue to inhibit [[Adenylyl cyclase|adenylate cyclase]], some [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]], and activate some [[Potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup> channels]], and [[phospholipase C]] and [[Phospholipase D|D]]. A<sub>1</sub> receptors are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], [[Cerebral cortex|cerebral]] and [[Cerebellum|cerebellar cortex]], and particular [[Thalamus|thalamic nuclei]]. Adenosine acts on A<sub>1</sub> receptors to decrease opening of [[N-type calcium channel|N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]] in some hippocampal neurons, and therefore decrease the rate of firing since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for neurotransmitter release. Caffeine's antagonistic action on the A<sub>1</sub> receptor thus decreases the action of adenosine, allowing increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through N-type channels and higher rates of neurotransmitter release.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Other actions of caffeine===\nThough antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary mechanism of caffeine, Introduction of the methylxanthine into the body also increases the rate of release and recycling of some [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s such as [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]] and [[dopamine]]. Caffeine also has an excitatory effect on [[Cholinergic|mesocortical cholinergic neurons]] by acting as an antagonist on adenosine receptors that normally inhibit the neuron.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Genetics and variability of caffeine consumption==\nWhile many factors contribute to individual differences in a person's response to caffeine, such as environmental and demographic factors (i.e. age, drug use, circadian factors, etc.), genetics play an important role in individual variability. This inconsistency in responses to caffeine can take place either at the metabolic or at the drug-receptor level.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Amy |last2=Palmer |first2=Abraham A. |last3=de Wit |first3=Harriet |date=June 9, 2010 |title=Genetics of caffeine consumption and responses to caffeine |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=211 |issue=3 |pages=245\u2013257 |doi=10.1007/s00213-010-1900-1 |pmc=4242593 |pmid=20532872}}</ref> The effects of genetic factors can occur either directly by changing acute or chronic reactions to the drug or indirectly by altering other psychological or physiological processes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSome of these processes include wakefulness, stimulation, and mood and cognition enhancement.

Diagnosis also requires that the panic attacks or anxiety due to the use of the intoxicating substance cause a certain amount of disturbance in the patient or lead to deficiency of varying types of daily performance.<ref name=\"DSM5\" />\n\n===Diagnostic features===\nIn addition to the criteria above, it is important to recognize that the diagnostic criteria for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are not met if the symptoms of panic come before the intoxication by the substance. In caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, a diagnosis will not be made if symptoms of anxiety or panic precede the ingestion of caffeine. Also, if symptoms persist for more than one month after substance intoxication, the diagnosis cannot be made. Persistence and continuation of symptoms beyond the initial consumption of caffeine suggest an alternate diagnosis that would better explain the long-lasting symptoms. Anxiety symptoms caused by caffeine are often mistaken for serious mental disorders including [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], leaving patients medicated for the wrong issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Torres|first=Francis M.|date=April 2009|title=Caffeine - Induced Psychiatric Disorders|url=http://www.americanmedtech.org/files/STEP_Online_articles/353.pdf|journal=Journal of Continuing Education Topics & Issues|doi=|pmid=|access-date=22 February 2016}}</ref> A caffeine-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made, rather than a substance abuse or intoxication diagnosis, when symptoms of panic attacks or anxiety predominate.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Prevalence===\nAlthough exact rates of prevalence are not available, general population data shows a 0.002% prevalence over a year-long period and higher prevalence within clinical populations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Caffeine==\n[[File:Caffeine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|180x180px|Caffeine structure]]\nCaffeine is a [[Xanthine|methylxanthine]], and is hydrophobic.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last=Fredholm |first=B.

Absorption in the gastrointestinal tract reaches near completion at about 99% after only 45&nbsp;minutes. [[Half-life]] of caffeine for most adults is between 2.5 and 4.5&nbsp;hours when consumption is limited to less than 10&nbsp;mg/kg. However, during neonatal development, half-life for the fetus is significantly longer and decreases exponentially after birth to reach a normal rate at about 6 months.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P-450]], a [[hemeprotein]], acts in liver [[microsome]]s to metabolize caffeine into dimethylxanthines, monomethylxanthines, dimethyl uric acids, monomethyl uric acids, trimethylallantoin, dimethylallantoin, and derivatives of [[uracil]]. Most caffeine is metabolized by 3-methyl demethylation, forming the metabolite of [[paraxanthine]]. Many metabolites, in addition to caffeine, act within the body and are partly responsible for the physiological response to caffeine.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Mechanism of caffeine action==\nCaffeine acts in multiple ways within the brain and the rest of the body. However, due to the concentration of caffeine required, [[Receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of [[adenosine]] receptors is the primary mode of action.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" /> The following mechanisms are ways in which caffeine may act within the body, but depending on necessary caffeine concentration and other factors may not be responsible for the clinical effects of the substance.\n\n===Mobilization of intracellular calcium===\nAt very high concentrations of about 1\u20132 [[Molar concentration|mM]], caffeine lowers the excitability threshold in muscle cells, leading to prolonged contraction. The introduction of such high doses of caffeine allows calcium to enter the muscle cell through the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] more readily. Influx of calcium through the membranes in muscle cells requires at least 250 \u03bcM of caffeine. Normally, other toxic effects of caffeine begin to occur in concentrations over 200&nbsp;\u03bcM, however average consumption averages lead to concentrations less than 100&nbsp;\u03bcM. This means that calcium influx and mobilization are most likely not the cause of caffeine's effect on the central nervous system, and are therefore not the cause of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" />\n\n===Inhibition of phosphodiesterases===\nMethylxanthines such as caffeine inhibit the action of [[cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase]], which normally acts to break down [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, is a second messenger important in many cellular processes and is a critical factor in [[signal transduction]]. The inhibition of the phosphodiesterase would lead to a buildup of cAMP, increasing the activity of the second messenger throughout the cell. Though this mechanism is possible, it only occurs after levels of caffeine have reached a toxic level, and therefore it is unlikely to explain the mechanism of caffeine in the brain.<ref name=\"NehligEtal1992\" />\n\n===Antagonism of adenosine receptors===\nThere are four well-known [[adenosine receptor]]s found in the body, [[Adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]], [[Adenosine A2A receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]], [[Adenosine A2B receptor|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[Adenosine A3 receptor|A<sub>3</sub>]]. The endogenous agonist for these receptors is [[adenosine]], which is a [[Purine|purine nucleoside]] that is important for processes such as energy transfer in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) and signal transduction in the form of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP). A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors require concentrations of caffeine that do not occur at normal physiological levels or with normal levels of caffeine consumption in order to be antagonized, and will therefore not be considered as a possible mechanism for caffeine-induced anxiety.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCaffeine acts as an antagonist of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Adenosine is a normal [[Neuromodulation|neuromodulator]] that activates adenosine [[G protein\u2013coupled receptor|g-protein coupled receptors]]. The actions of A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors oppose each other but are both inhibited by caffeine due to its function as an antagonist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA<sub>2A</sub> receptors are coupled to G<sub>s</sub> proteins which activate [[Adenylyl cyclase|adenylate cyclase]] and some [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]]. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are located in [[dopamine]] rich brain regions. A<sub>2A</sub> receptor mRNA was found in the same neurons as the dopamine receptor [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]] within the [[Striatum|dorsal striatum]], [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[Olfactory tubercle|tuberculum olfactorium]]. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are not found in neurons that express the dopamine receptor [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]] receptors and [[Substance P]]. Within the striatum, part of the basal ganglia, activation of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors by adenosine increases [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] release, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When caffeine binds to the receptor, less inhibitory neurotransmitter is released, supporting caffeine's role as a central nervous system stimulant.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA<sub>1</sub> receptors are paired with the G-proteins of [[G protein\u2013coupled receptor|G<sub>i-1</sub>, G<sub>i-2</sub>, G<sub>i-3</sub>, G<sub>o1</sub>, and G<sub>o2</sub>]]. The g-proteins of A<sub>1</sub> receptors continue to inhibit [[Adenylyl cyclase|adenylate cyclase]], some [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]], and activate some [[Potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup> channels]], and [[phospholipase C]] and [[Phospholipase D|D]]. A<sub>1</sub> receptors are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], [[Cerebral cortex|cerebral]] and [[Cerebellum|cerebellar cortex]], and particular [[Thalamus|thalamic nuclei]]. Adenosine acts on A<sub>1</sub> receptors to decrease opening of [[N-type calcium channel|N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]] in some hippocampal neurons, and therefore decrease the rate of firing since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for neurotransmitter release. Caffeine's antagonistic action on the A<sub>1</sub> receptor thus decreases the action of adenosine, allowing increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through N-type channels and higher rates of neurotransmitter release.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Other actions of caffeine===\nThough antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary mechanism of caffeine, Introduction of the methylxanthine into the body also increases the rate of release and recycling of some [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s such as [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]] and [[dopamine]]. Caffeine also has an excitatory effect on [[Cholinergic|mesocortical cholinergic neurons]] by acting as an antagonist on adenosine receptors that normally inhibit the neuron.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Genetics and variability of caffeine consumption==\nWhile many factors contribute to individual differences in a person's response to caffeine, such as environmental and demographic factors (i.e. age, drug use, circadian factors, etc.), genetics play an important role in individual variability. This inconsistency in responses to caffeine can take place either at the metabolic or at the drug-receptor level.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Amy |last2=Palmer |first2=Abraham A. |last3=de Wit |first3=Harriet |date=June 9, 2010 |title=Genetics of caffeine consumption and responses to caffeine |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=211 |issue=3 |pages=245\u2013257 |doi=10.1007/s00213-010-1900-1 |pmc=4242593 |pmid=20532872}}</ref> The effects of genetic factors can occur either directly by changing acute or chronic reactions to the drug or indirectly by altering other psychological or physiological processes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSome of these processes include wakefulness, stimulation, and mood and cognition enhancement.
