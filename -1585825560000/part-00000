[[Nick Cannon]] returned as host.\n\nSixteen celebrities compete anonymously in newly created full-bodied costumes including distinctive masks. Before each performance a video package teases clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice. After each performs in their own voice, the panel attempts to guess who is the masked singer. The contestants are later voted on to see who is safe and continues, or is up for a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Panelists and host==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width   = 420\n| align         = left\n| direction     = horizontal\n| header        = Season 2 panelists and host\n| image1        = Robin Thicke 2012 cropped.jpg\n| caption1      = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2        = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2      = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3        = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3      = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4        = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4      = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5        = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5      = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\nSinger-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]] returned as panelists.

The Tables consolidated earlier traditions into an enduring set of laws.<ref>Jolowicz, H.F.

''Oxford Classical Dictionary'' (4th ed.)</ref>\n\nDisplayed in the [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]], \"The Twelve Tables\" stated the rights and duties of the [[Roman citizen]].  Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the [[plebeian]] class, who had hitherto been excluded from the higher benefits of the [[Republic]].  The law had previously been unwritten and exclusively interpreted by upper-class priests, the [[pontifices]].  Something of the regard with which later Romans came to view the Twelve Tables is captured in the remark of [[Cicero]] (106\u201343 BC) that the \"Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to surpass the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in plenitude of utility\".  Cicero scarcely exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.<ref>Book: \"[[The Age of Classical Civilization]]\"; Chapter \"The Twelve Tables c. 450 BC\"; p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Twelve Tables are sufficiently comprehensive that their substance has been described as a 'code',<ref>Mommsen, T. ''The History of Rome'' trans. W.P.

They generally took for granted such things as the institutions of the family and various rituals for formal transactions. The provisions were often highly specific and diverse.<ref>Steinberg, S.

After the expulsion of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]], the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] was governed by a hierarchy of [[Roman Magistrate|magistrates]]. Initially, only [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] were eligible to become magistrates and this, among other plebeian complaints, was a source of discontent for [[plebeians]]. In the context of this unequal status, plebeians would take action to secure concessions for themselves using the threat of secession. They would threaten to leave the city with the consequence that it would grind to a halt, as the plebeians were Rome's labor force. Tradition held that one of the most important concessions won in this class struggle was the establishment of the ''Twelve Tables'', establishing basic procedural rights for all Roman citizens in relation to each other.<ref name=\"du Plessis 5-6; 29-30\">{{cite book|last=du Plessis|first=Paul|title=Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957488-9|pages=5\u20136, 29\u201330|edition=4th}}</ref> The drafting of the Twelve Tables may have been fomented by a desire for self-regulation by the patricians, or for other reasons.<ref name=\"Crawford\"/>\n\nAround 450 BC, the first ''[[decemviri]]'' (decemvirate, board of \"Ten Men\") were appointed to draw up the first ten tables. According to [[Titus Livius|Livy]], they sent an embassy to [[Greece]] to study the legislative system of [[Athens]], known as the [[Solonian Constitution]], but also to find out about the legislation of other [[Greeks|Greek]] cities.<ref>Livy, 2002, p. 23</ref><ref>Durant, 1942, p. 23</ref> Some scholars deny that the Romans imitated the Greeks in this respect<ref>Steinberg, S.

Here is how [[Livy]] describes their creation:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...every citizen should quietly consider each point, then talk it over with his friends, and, finally, bring forward for public discussion any additions or subtractions which seemed desirable.\" (cf. Liv. [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 3#34|III.34]])\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 449 BC, the second decemvirate completed the last two codes, and after a ''[[secessio plebis]]'' to force the Senate to consider them, the Law of the Twelve Tables was formally promulgated.<ref>McCarty,  Nick \"Rome The Greatest Empire of the Ancient World\", The Rosen Publishing Group, 2008</ref>  According to Livy (AUC [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 3#57|3.57.10]]) the Twelve Tables were inscribed on [[bronze]] (Pomponius (Dig. 1 tit. 2 s2 \u00a74) alone says on ivory), and posted publicly, so all Romans could read and know them.\n\nSome of the provisions are procedural to ensure fairness among all Romans in the courts, while other established legal terms dictating the legality of capital crimes, intentional homicide, treason, perjury, judicial corruption, and writing slanderous poems.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Romans valued keeping peace in the city and the Twelve Tables were a mechanism of establishing and continuing peace and equality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Laws of the Twelve Tables ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 1\n|Procedure: for courts and trials\n|-\n|Table 2\n|Trials continued & Theft\n|-\n|Table 3\n|Debt\n|-\n|Table 4\n|Rights of fathers (''pater familias'') over the family\n|-\n|Table 5\n|Legal guardianship and inheritance laws\n|-\n|Table 6\n|Acquisition and possession\n|-\n|Table 7\n|Land rights & crimes\n|-\n|Table 8\n|Torts and delicts (Laws of injury)\n|-\n|Table 9\n|Public law\n|-\n|Table 10\n|Sacred law\n|-\n|Table 11\n|Supplement I\n|-\n|Table 12\n|Supplement II\n|}\n\n=== Table III: Debt ===\nThe [[laws]] the Twelve Tables covered were a way to publicly display rights that each citizen had in the public and private sphere.  These Twelve Tables displayed what was previously understood in Roman society as the unwritten laws.  The public display of the copper tablets allowed for a more balanced society between the Roman [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] who were educated and understood the laws of legal transactions, and the Roman [[Plebeian (ancient Rome)|plebeians]] who had little education or experience in understanding law.  By revealing the unwritten rules of society to the public, the Twelve Tables provided a means of safeguard for Plebeians allowing them the opportunity to avoid financial exploitation and added balance to the [[Roman economy]]\n\nFeatured within the Twelve Tables are five rules about how to handle debtors and creditors. These rules show how the ancient Romans maintained peace with financial policy.  In his article ''Development of the Roman Law of Debt Security,'' Donald E. Phillipson states the Twelve Tables were, \u201cA set of statutes known as the Twelve Tables that was passed by an early assembly served as the foundation of the Roman private law.  The Twelve Tables were enacted in the mid-fifth century B.C. as the result of a conflict among social classes in ancient Rome.\u201d  (pp.&nbsp;1231\u20131232).<ref name=\" Phillipson, D. E. 1968\">Phillipson, D.E. (1968). Development of the Roman Law of Debt Security. ''Stanford Law Review, 20''(6), 1230. {{doi|10.2307/1227498}}</ref> Phillipson also describes the leniency of the relationship between debtor and creditor on how it was changed and arranged in the 5th century BC and how [[Roman law]] surrounding it was tweaked within the Twelve Tables that initially drew out the legal boundaries surrounding debt.  Especially discussing the love of creditor's rights, Phillipson states, \u201cIn the fifth century B.C. only movables were pledged under pignus, although any res in which bonitary ownership was held was capable of being pledged. However, by the late Republic, land, and buildings were increasingly pledged in pignus arrangements. This increased usage paralleled the expansion of creditors' rights with respect to the pledged property. The right of possession and seizure (jus possidendi) and the right of foreclosure and sale (just distrained) were probably the most important of the developing creditors' rights. These increased creditors' rights also encouraged and contributed to the expansion of the types of resin which bonitary ownership, and thus pignus arrangements, were possible. For example, the use of pignus expanded to include usufructs, rustic servitudes, rights of way, and even pledges themselves by the second century A.D.\u201d (p.&nbsp;1239).<ref name=\" Phillipson, D. E. 1968\"/>\n\nIn the book, ''The Twelve Tables,'' written by an anonymous source due to its origins being collaborated through a series of translations of tablets and ancient references, P.R. Coleman-Norton arranged and translated many of the significant features of debt that the Twelve Tables enacted into law during the 5th century.  The translation of the legal features surrounding debt and derived from the known sources of the Twelve Tables are stated as such\n\n\u201c1. Of debt acknowledged and for matters judged in court (in iure) thirty days shall be allowed by law [for payment or for satisfaction].\n\n2. After that [elapse of thirty days without payment] hand shall be laid on (manus infection) [the debtor]. He shall be brought into court (in ius).\n\n3. Unless he (the debtor) discharge the debtor unless someone appear in court (in iure) to guarantee payment for him, he (the creditor) shall take [the debtor] with him. He shall bind [him] either with thong or with fetters, of which the weight shall be not less than fifteen pounds or shall be more if he (the creditor) choose.\n\n4. If he (the debtor) chooses, he shall live on his own [means]. If he lives not on his own [means], [the creditor,] who shall hold him in bonds, shall give [him] a pound of bread daily; if he (the creditor) shall so desire, he shall give [him] more.\n\n5. Unless they (the debtors) make a compromise, they (the debtors) shall be held in bonds for sixty days. During those days they shall be brought to [the magistrate] into the comitia (meeting-place) on three successive markets [\u2026]\u201d<ref>Coleman-Norton, P.R. (1960). ''The Twelve Tables''.

Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the [[plebeian]] class, who had hitherto been excluded from the higher benefits of the [[Republic]].  The law had previously been unwritten and exclusively interpreted by upper-class priests, the [[pontifices]].  Something of the regard with which later Romans came to view the Twelve Tables is captured in the remark of [[Cicero]] (106\u201343 BC) that the \"Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to surpass the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in plenitude of utility\".  Cicero scarcely exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.<ref>Book: \"[[The Age of Classical Civilization]]\"; Chapter \"The Twelve Tables c. 450 BC\"; p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Twelve Tables are sufficiently comprehensive that their substance has been described as a 'code',<ref>Mommsen, T.

After the expulsion of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]], the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] was governed by a hierarchy of [[Roman Magistrate|magistrates]]. Initially, only [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] were eligible to become magistrates and this, among other plebeian complaints, was a source of discontent for [[plebeians]]. In the context of this unequal status, plebeians would take action to secure concessions for themselves using the threat of secession. They would threaten to leave the city with the consequence that it would grind to a halt, as the plebeians were Rome's labor force. Tradition held that one of the most important concessions won in this class struggle was the establishment of the ''Twelve Tables'', establishing basic procedural rights for all Roman citizens in relation to each other.<ref name=\"du Plessis 5-6; 29-30\">{{cite book|last=du Plessis|first=Paul|title=Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957488-9|pages=5\u20136, 29\u201330|edition=4th}}</ref> The drafting of the Twelve Tables may have been fomented by a desire for self-regulation by the patricians, or for other reasons.<ref name=\"Crawford\"/>\n\nAround 450 BC, the first ''[[decemviri]]'' (decemvirate, board of \"Ten Men\") were appointed to draw up the first ten tables. According to [[Titus Livius|Livy]], they sent an embassy to [[Greece]] to study the legislative system of [[Athens]], known as the [[Solonian Constitution]], but also to find out about the legislation of other [[Greeks|Greek]] cities.<ref>Livy, 2002, p. 23</ref><ref>Durant, 1942, p. 23</ref> Some scholars deny that the Romans imitated the Greeks in this respect<ref>Steinberg, S.

Here is how [[Livy]] describes their creation:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"...every citizen should quietly consider each point, then talk it over with his friends, and, finally, bring forward for public discussion any additions or subtractions which seemed desirable.\" (cf. Liv. [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 3#34|III.34]])\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 449 BC, the second decemvirate completed the last two codes, and after a ''[[secessio plebis]]'' to force the Senate to consider them, the Law of the Twelve Tables was formally promulgated.<ref>McCarty,  Nick \"Rome The Greatest Empire of the Ancient World\", The Rosen Publishing Group, 2008</ref>  According to Livy (AUC [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 3#57|3.57.10]]) the Twelve Tables were inscribed on [[bronze]] (Pomponius (Dig. 1 tit. 2 s2 \u00a74) alone says on ivory), and posted publicly, so all Romans could read and know them.\n\nSome of the provisions are procedural to ensure fairness among all Romans in the courts, while other established legal terms dictating the legality of capital crimes, intentional homicide, treason, perjury, judicial corruption, and writing slanderous poems.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Romans valued keeping peace in the city and the Twelve Tables were a mechanism of establishing and continuing peace and equality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Laws of the Twelve Tables ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 1\n|Procedure: for courts and trials\n|-\n|Table 2\n|Trials continued & Theft\n|-\n|Table 3\n|Debt\n|-\n|Table 4\n|Rights of fathers (''pater familias'') over the family\n|-\n|Table 5\n|Legal guardianship and inheritance laws\n|-\n|Table 6\n|Acquisition and possession\n|-\n|Table 7\n|Land rights & crimes\n|-\n|Table 8\n|Torts and delicts (Laws of injury)\n|-\n|Table 9\n|Public law\n|-\n|Table 10\n|Sacred law\n|-\n|Table 11\n|Supplement I\n|-\n|Table 12\n|Supplement II\n|}\n\n=== Table III: Debt ===\nThe [[laws]] the Twelve Tables covered were a way to publicly display rights that each citizen had in the public and private sphere.  These Twelve Tables displayed what was previously understood in Roman society as the unwritten laws.  The public display of the copper tablets allowed for a more balanced society between the Roman [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] who were educated and understood the laws of legal transactions, and the Roman [[Plebeian (ancient Rome)|plebians]] who had little education or experience in understanding law.  By revealing the unwritten rules of society to the public, the Twelve Tables provided a means of safeguard for Plebeians allowing them the opportunity to avoid financial exploitation and added balance to the [[Roman economy]]\n\nFeatured within the Twelve Tables are five rules about how to handle debtors and creditors. These rules show how the ancient Romans maintained peace with financial policy.  In his article ''Development of the Roman Law of Debt Security,'' Donald E. Phillipson states the Twelve Tables were, \u201cA set of statutes known as the Twelve Tables that was passed by an early assembly served as the foundation of the Roman private law.  The Twelve Tables were enacted in the mid-fifth century B.C. as the result of a conflict among social classes in ancient Rome.\u201d  (pp. 1231\u20131232).<ref name=\" Phillipson, D. E. 1968\">Phillipson, D.E. (1968). Development of the Roman Law of Debt Security. ''Stanford Law Review, 20''(6), 1230. {{doi|10.2307/1227498}}</ref> Phillipson also describes the leniency of the relationship between debtor and creditor on how it was changed and arranged in the 5th century BC and how [[Roman law]] surrounding it was tweaked within the Twelve Tables that initially drew out the legal boundaries surrounding debt.  Especially discussing the love of creditor's rights, Phillipson states, \u201cIn the fifth century B.C. only movables were pledged under pignus, although any res in which bonitary ownership was held was capable of being pledged. However, by the late Republic, land, and buildings were increasingly pledged in pignus arrangements. This increased usage paralleled the expansion of creditors' rights with respect to the pledged property. The right of possession and seizure (jus possidendi) and the right of foreclosure and sale (just distrained) were probably the most important of the developing creditors' rights. These increased creditors' rights also encouraged and contributed to the expansion of the types of resin which bonitary ownership, and thus pignus arrangements, were possible. For example, the use of pignus expanded to include usufructs, rustic servitudes, rights of way, and even pledges themselves by the second century A.D.\u201d (p. 1239).<ref name=\" Phillipson, D. E. 1968\"/>\n\nIn the book, ''The Twelve Tables,'' written by an anonymous source due to its origins being collaborated through a series of translations of tablets and ancient references, P.R. Coleman-Norton arranged and translated many of the significant features of debt that the Twelve Tables enacted into law during the 5th century.  The translation of the legal features surrounding debt and derived from the known sources of the Twelve Tables are stated as such\n\n\u201c1. Of debt acknowledged and for matters judged in court (in iure) thirty days shall be allowed by law [for payment or for satisfaction].\n\n2. After that [elapse of thirty days without payment] hand shall be laid on (manus infection) [the debtor]. He shall be brought into court (in ius).\n\n3. Unless he (the debtor) discharge the debtor unless someone appear in court (in iure) to guarantee payment for him, he (the creditor) shall take [the debtor] with him. He shall bind [him] either with thong or with fetters, of which the weight shall be not less than fifteen pounds or shall be more if he (the creditor) choose.\n\n4. If he (the debtor) chooses, he shall live on his own [means]. If he lives not on his own [means], [the creditor,] who shall hold him in bonds, shall give [him] a pound of bread daily; if he (the creditor) shall so desire, he shall give [him] more.\n\n5. Unless they (the debtors) make a compromise, they (the debtors) shall be held in bonds for sixty days. During those days they shall be brought to [the magistrate] into the comitia (meeting-place) on three successive markets [\u2026]\u201d<ref>Coleman-Norton, P.R. (1960). ''The Twelve Tables''.
