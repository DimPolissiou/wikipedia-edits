{"title_page": "Pope Pius XII and Russia", "text_new": "{{main|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\n'''Pope Pius XII and Russia''' describes relations of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], the [[Orthodox Church]], and United Oriental Churches resulting in the eradication of the Church in most parts of the Soviet Union during the [[Stalinist]] era. Most [[persecution]]s of the Church occurred during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe relations of the Vatican with Russia are one element of the topic [[Persecutions against the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII]]. Equally destructive to the Church were the simultaneous persecutions of [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China|the Church in China]]\n\nRelations between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and the Holy See were always difficult, although at times both sides tried to show some flexibility. On January 23, 1918, the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana''<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313-317</ref> in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of [[communism]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''Miserantissimus Redemptor'',<ref>AAS 20 1928 165-178</ref> ''Caritate Christi'',<ref>AAS 24 1932 177-194</ref> and ''Divini Redemptoris.''<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65-106</ref>\n\n==The War years: 1941-1945 ==\nThe [[pontificate]] of Pius XII faced extraordinary problems. During the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred the Soviet authorities from persecuting all Christian churches within the Soviet Union as hostile to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after [[Germany]] occupied the western part of [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the eastern part along with the [[Baltic Countries]] including predominantly Catholic [[Lithuania]]. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the USSR. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some like the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Church are united with Rome which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pius XII, upholding the neutrality of the Holy See, had abstained from any criticisms of the Soviet Union as it was attacked by Germany. Contrary to many rumours, the Pope never called the war a crusade against communism, nor did he encourage the extension of the war into the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Russian people [[Sacro Vergente|''Sacro Vergente'']], he wrote that despite these Church persecutions during the war, he would not utter one word which could have been used unfairly. Despite growing pressure, he never condoned or approved a war against communism or against Russia in 1941.<ref>AAS 1952, 508</ref> Helping to save lives whenever possible, especially in Soviet and German occupied Poland, he did not issue protests when the allies in the East engaged in mass killings or deportations during the war.\n\n==  The destruction of Catholic Oriental Churches ==\n\nAfter the war, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of [[Joseph Stalin]], but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches which was united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] located in the Ukraine. Ruthenian Catholics call themselves Rusyns. They are closely related to the Ukrainians and speak a dialect of the same language. The traditional Rusyn homeland extends into northeast Slovakia and the Lemko region of southeast Poland. Until 1922, the area was largely a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. After becoming Polish, which follows the Latin rite, [[Polonisation]] and significant problems for all Orthodox, including united Christians developed.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\">Giovannetti, 112</ref><ref>Wikipedia Polonisation</ref> Some Ruthenians, resisting [[Polonisation]], felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI.\n\nAfter 1945, it was claimed that the union with Rome was a Polish conspiracy to dominate and wipe out the Oriental culture of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]: United orthodox faithful and priests had to suffer under Polish bishops of the Latin Rite and Polonisation. But they were apprehended by the [[Soviet Army]] under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and therefore, continued ties to Rome were made impossible.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\"/> The new [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] of Moscow called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union for a separation from Rome:\n\n* Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to the your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!<ref>Giovannetti,  115</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] replied: \"Who does not know, that [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter which contributes not a little to the persecution?\"<ref>AAS 1946,  Orientales omnes Ecclesias 57</ref> Pope Pius never shared Roosevelt's wartime optimism regarding Stalin's allegedly changed attitudes towards religious freedom and tolerance and related guarantees from the newly established [[United Nations]]. [[Orientales omnes Ecclesias|''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'']] refers to [[United Nations]] resolutions of a world of tolerance, free of religious persecution . Pius continues, \"This had given us hope that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church, the more so since the Church has always taught, and teaches, that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil power, within the sphere and bounds of its authority, is a duty of conscience. But, unfortunately, the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened, have almost destroyed, our hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are concerned.\"<ref>AAS 1946, Orientales omnes Ecclesias, 58</ref>\n\nThe Pope knew not only about the attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome. He also was aware that in months preceding the encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, and Josaphat Kocylovskyi. Some, including Bishop [[Nicetas Budka]], perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946. July 1, 1945, some three hundred priests of the United Church wrote to Molotov. They protested the arrest of all bishops and large parts of the Catholic clergy.<ref>Guglielmo de Vries, Oriente Cristiano, ieri e oggi, Roma, 270-275</ref> After the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's public presence in Russia was annihilated. Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi,  517</ref> After the war, the Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy, after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested on March 6, 1946.<ref>Adrianyi,  518</ref> The Catholic Church of Ukraine was thus liquidated. All properties were turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became a subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of [[de-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce results, aside from modest improvements in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1956. January 1958, [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed was identical with Kremlin policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref> The Vatican did not respond officially, and reported unofficial contacts will not be known until 2028, when Vatican Archives open access to all documents of the pontificate of Pius XII.\n\n== Pope Pius XII on Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church ==\n\nTwo months after his election on May 12, 1939, in ''Singolari Animi'', a papal letter to the Sacred Congregation of the Oriental Church, Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome, and prayed for those who suffer in their country, awaiting with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord.<ref>AAS 1939, 165</ref>\n\nThe encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'' is a summary of the relations between the united oriental churches and Rome until the persecutions of 1945. Pope Pius presents a comprehensive historical review of the reunion, to show the many trials and bloody persecutions but also the advantages of the union to the faithful in Ukraine. In ''Sacro Vergente'' this history is repeated with a view to relations with Russia in general. He again rejects [[communism]] but not [[communists]]. Those who err, are always welcome.<ref>AAS,1952,  509</ref> At Saint Josaphat College he mourns the terrible changes of the past twenty years in Russia, bishops incarcerated, in concentration camps, banned from their homes, killed while in jail, for one reason only, they are faithful to the Holy See.<ref>AAS,1952,  877</ref>\n\n[[Orientales Ecclesias|''Orientales Ecclesias'']] reviews the efforts of the Vatican at improving relations with the oriental churches. Pope Pius XII mentions the naming of the first ever Oriental Cardinal [[Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian]], and the reform of the Eastern [[Canon Law]] as two examples. But the most flourishing Christian communities are wiped out without trace these days. He does not know details except that many bishops and priests are deported to unknown destinations, to [[concentration camps]] and to jails, while some are under house arrest.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias, 5</ref> In Bulgaria, Bishop Bossilkoff was executed with many others. But Bulgaria is not alone. Many are robbed of the most basic natural and human rights, and mistreated in the most extreme ways. The suffering in Ukraine is immense.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 12</ref> The Pope refers specifically to the Kiev show trial against bishops of the oriental Church. Still there is reason for comfort and hope: The strength of the faithful. The Christian faith makes better citizens, who use their God-given freedom to work for their societies to further the causes of justice and unity.<ref>AAS 1952,  Orientales Ecclesias 19</ref> The Pope concludes by requesting worldwide public prayers for the persecuted, and hopes that they will open the jails and loosen the chains in those countries.\n\n[[Novimus Nos|''Novimus Nos'']] is a letter to the bishops of the Oriental rite asking for faith, strength and hope. The Pope expresses his ardent desire for unity of all Eastern Christians with the Western church and comforts those who suffer in jail or unknown locations for their faith and faithfulness to the Holy See. In ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius reminds the whole world of the sufferings and persecutions in Russia and dedicates her to the special protection of Mary, who has so many Russian followers.\n\n*Communications pertinent to Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church\n** 1.\t''Singulari Animi,

It is the sequel to ''[[Subnautica]]'', which was released in January 2018.\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' was released in [[early access]] for Microsoft Windows and macOS in January 2019. \n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' is a [[Survival game|survival]], [[Adventure game|adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player controls a researcher researching the local environment and nearby alien facility, on planet 4546B.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of ''[[Subnautica]]''. Alterra has placed the Vesper Station into orbit around the planet 4546B for research. The story opens with the Player being told to head to the nearby Mountain Alien Facility to locate Serik Jevov (Jeff). The player then encounters the voice of one of the architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone; the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. Afterward, the Alien Facility is  struck by a meteor and begins re-routing its power to Sanctuary. The player is told to get to the escape ship back at base. However, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an Avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing them to have to swim out into open water, and head to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communication ability. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message tracked to the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges. Once the player is exploring the Underwater Alien Facility, they are threatened by an Alien voice saying that its storage medium is failing. As the player reaches the inner of the Alien Facility, it notes that is has found an \"adequate storage medium\". The player offers their PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into. However, it transfers into the player's Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player knows its name is Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, their PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring the player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed anywhere from 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, they are told that the ship - took off at the beginning of the game, crash-landed in the Glacial Basin and that they have three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player can locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, they find a Cache with one of the architect's body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, they get a message saying that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the player's adventure, they find two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to the architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, they are told that they are able to construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe player gets contacted by Sam to be told that the Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that they need a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The player then calls Robin and the mission director about what happened. Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as they are most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside the player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that they need to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\nAfter the player receives the white tablet to enter the facility, they head to the Alien Facility and enter it.  The game ends with The Vesper station being blown up.\n\n<!--== Plot == how are there two different plots? That needs explaining for inclusion.\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of Subnautica. Alterra is funding a smaller company called XenoWorks, which the player works for.

He was born August 6 at [[Tadepalligudem]], West Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh.

Prudhviraj completed his master's degree in Economics from Andhra University. Since childhood, he participated in many stage shows and cultural activities.
