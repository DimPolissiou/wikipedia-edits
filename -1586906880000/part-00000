Nearly three years later in 1976, after Hall & Oates had moved to [[RCA Records]] and had scored the hit \"[[Sara Smile]]\", [[Atlantic Records]] re-released the original single under a different number (Atlantic 3332).  This time, \"She's Gone\" was a hit, peaking at No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.
