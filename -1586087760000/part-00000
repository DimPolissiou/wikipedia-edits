Commonly called '''greenhood orchids''', they are [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]], [[deciduous]], [[Perennial plant|perennial]], [[tuber]]ous, [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]] found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]] and one [[Indonesia]]n island. The flowers are mostly green, sometimes with brown, reddish or white stripes, and are distinguished from other orchids by their unusual flower structures and pollination mechanism.\n\n==Description==\nGreenhood orchids are all terrestrial herbs with an underground tuber like many other [[Genus|genera]] of orchids but are distinguished by a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]-like \"galea\" formed by the fusing of the [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] [[sepal]] and two [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] [[petal]]s. The galea curves forward, covers the sexual parts of the flower, is important in the [[pollination]] process and is about as long as the two petals. The dorsal sepal is  [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] white with green, reddish or brown stripes. The two lateral sepals are joined at their base, form the front of the flower and usually protrude to form \"points\" or \"ears\" which extend above or to the side of the galea. The third (medial) petal forms the highly modified [[labellum (botany)|labellum]]. As in other orchids, the sexual parts of the flower form part of the [[Column (botany)|column]] and in all greenhoods, this structure has a pair of mostly translucent [[Glossary of botanical terms#W|wings]] and is also important in pollination.<ref name=\"Jones\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|last2=Clements|first2=Mark A.|title=A Reassessment of ''Pterostylis'' R.Br.

A new one is produced early in the life of the parent tuber at the same time as a new shoot is produced and continues to grow, reaching maturity at the end of the growing season. In some species, a larger number of \"daughter\" tubers grow, and a colony of orchids is produced. The leaves are either attached in a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] to the base of the [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] or \"stalk\" of the plant by a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], or further up it, in which case the leaves are [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]].

Commonly called '''greenhood orchids''', they are [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]], [[deciduous]], [[Perennial plant|perennial]], [[tuber]]ous, [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]] found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]] and one [[Indonesia]]n island. The flowers are mostly green, sometimes with brown, reddish or white stripes, and are distinguished from other orchids by their unusual flower structures and pollination mechanism.\n\n==Description==\nGreenhood orchids are all terrestrial herbs with an underground tuber like many other [[Genus|genera]] of orchids but are distinguished by a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]-like \"galea\" formed by the fusing of the [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] [[sepal]] and two [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] [[petal]]s. The galea curves forward, covers the sexual parts of the flower, is important in the [[pollination]] process and is about as long as the two petals. The dorsal sepal is  [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] white with green, reddish or brown stripes. The two lateral sepals are joined at their base, form the front of the flower and usually protrude to form \"points\" or \"ears\" which extend above or to the side of the galea. The third (medial) petal forms the highly modified [[labellum (botany)|labellum]]. As in other orchids, the sexual parts of the flower form part of the [[Column (botany)|column]] and in all greenhoods, this structure has a pair of mostly translucent [[Glossary of botanical terms#W|wings]] and is also important in pollination.<ref name=\"Jones\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|last2=Clements|first2=Mark A.|title=A Reassessment of ''Pterostylis'' R.Br.

A new one is produced early in the life of the parent tuber at the same time as a new shoot is produced and continues to grow, reaching maturity at the end of the growing season. In some species, a larger number of \"daughter\" tubers grow, and a colony of orchids is produced. The leaves are either attached in a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] to the base of the [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] or \"stalk\" of the plant by a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], or further up it, in which case the leaves are [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]. There may be one or several flowers on the peduncle.<ref name=\"Jones\" /><ref name=\"plantnet\" /><ref name=\"FloraBase\" /><ref name=\"trin\"/>\n\nThe fruit of a greenhood is a [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]] [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] containing up to 500 tiny seeds and is oblong to elliptic in shape with three ridges. Other parts of the flower wither soon after pollination and the dry remains are attached to the end of the capsule.<ref name=\"Jones\" /><ref name=\"FloraBase\" />\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe first observation of ''Pterostylis'' by European botanists was probably by [[Joseph Banks]] when {{HMS|Endeavour}} visited [[Botany Bay]] in 1770 but any specimens collected were lost later in the voyage. The first formal description of a greenhood was by [[Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re]] who collected a specimen  from [[Bruny Island]] and gave it the name ''Disperis alata''.<ref name=\"APNI Labill\">{{cite web|title=''Disperis alata''|url= https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/instance/apni/488003|publisher=APNI|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> After several name changes, ''Disperis alata'' is now known as ''[[Pterostylis alata]]''.

They sometimes grow in semi-arid areas but usually near rocks or crevices where there is run-off during rain. In tropical regions they tend to grow at higher altitudes where temperatures are lower. Most have periods of dormancy which coincide with climatic extremes, surviving as small tubers until favourable conditions return.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Ecology==\nMost greenhoods are pollinated by insects, nearly always by tiny flies from the family [[Mycetophilidae]] or by mosquitoes (Family [[Culicidae]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peach|first=Daniel A.

Observation of the insect's reaction to [[wikt:entrapment|entrapment]] is difficult to observe, but in its struggle to escape, it either deposits [[Pollinium|pollinia]] from a previously visited flower or contacts the sticky viscidium and pollinia are attached, then carried to another flower.

{"title_page": "List of sexually active popes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a list of sexually active popes, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[presbyter|priests]] who were not celibate before they became pope, and popes who were legally married. Some candidates were [[human sexual behavior|sexually active]] before their election as [[pope]], and others were accused of being sexually active during their papacies. A number had offspring. The [[Second Council of the Lateran|Second Lateran Council]] (1139) made the promise to remain [[clerical celibacy|celibate]] a prerequisite to ordination, abolishing the married priesthood. Sexual relationships were generally undertaken therefore outside the bond of [[Sacrament of marriage|matrimony]] and each sexual act thus committed is considered a [[mortal sin]] by the Roman Catholic Church.  \n\nThere are various classifications for those who were sexually active at some time during their lives. Periods in parentheses refer to the years of their papacies.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|Catholic teachings on sexual morality}}\n\nFor many years of the Church's history, celibacy was considered optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many that most of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the [[New Testament]] (Mk 1:29\u201331; Mt 8:14\u201315; Lk 4:38\u201339; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[presbyters]] and [[deacons]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] were often married as well. It is also clear from epigraphy, the testimony of the [[Church Fathers]], synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources{{Nonspecific|date=January 2015}} that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature of the life of the Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline that could be practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.\n\nAlthough various local Church councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy in a particular area,<ref>{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Celibacy of the Clergy}}</ref> it was not until the [[Second Council of the Lateran|Second Lateran Council]] (1139) that whole of the [[Latin Church|Latin (Western) Rite]] of the Catholic Church decided to accept people for ordination only after they had taken a promise of [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]]. This applied to the leadership of the Church.<ref>[http://www.vanimo-diocese.com/download/pastoral_letters/2005-Pastoral-Paper-On-Priestly-Celibacy.pdf Priestly celibacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926192741/http://www.vanimo-diocese.com/download/pastoral_letters/2005-Pastoral-Paper-On-Priestly-Celibacy.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} retrieved June 9, 2008</ref>\n\n== Popes who were legally married ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!

Some candidates were [[human sexual behavior|sexually active]] before their election as [[pope]], and others were accused of being sexually active during their papacies. A number had offspring. The [[Second Council of the Lateran|Second Lateran Council]] (1139) made the promise to remain [[clerical celibacy|celibate]] a prerequisite to ordination, abolishing the married priesthood. Sexual relationships were generally undertaken therefore outside the bond of [[Sacrament of marriage|matrimony]] and each sexual act thus committed is considered a [[mortal sin]] by the Roman Catholic Church.  \n\nThere are various classifications for those who were sexually active at some time during their lives. Periods in parentheses refer to the years of their papacies.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|Catholic teachings on sexual morality}}\n\nFor many years of the Church's history, celibacy was considered optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many that most of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the [[New Testament]] (Mk 1:29\u201331; Mt 8:14\u201315; Lk 4:38\u201339; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[presbyters]] and [[deacons]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] were often married as well. It is also clear from epigraphy, the testimony of the [[Church Fathers]], synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources{{Nonspecific|date=January 2015}} that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature of the life of the Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline that could be practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.\n\nAlthough various local Church councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy in a particular area,<ref>{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Celibacy of the Clergy}}</ref> it was not until the [[Second Council of the Lateran|Second Lateran Council]] (1139) that whole of the [[Latin Church|Latin (Western) Rite]] of the Catholic Church decided to accept people for ordination only after they had taken a promise of [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]]. This applied to the leadership of the Church.<ref>[http://www.vanimo-diocese.com/download/pastoral_letters/2005-Pastoral-Paper-On-Priestly-Celibacy.pdf Priestly celibacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926192741/http://www.vanimo-diocese.com/download/pastoral_letters/2005-Pastoral-Paper-On-Priestly-Celibacy.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} retrieved June 9, 2008</ref>\n\n== Popes who were legally married ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!

In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further he bought a bankrupt oil mill at [[Chinchpokli]] and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after 2 years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at [[Nagpur]] named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving 4 goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution and a hydro-electric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Hotel]] at [[Colaba]] waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in India.\n\n=== 1904\u20131938 ===\nAfter Jamsetji's death, his older son [[Dorabji Tata]] became the Chairman in 1904. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel company (TISCO), now known as [[Tata Steel]] in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in [[London]]. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to [[Tata Power]]. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first batch admitted in 1911.\n\n=== 1938\u20131991 ===\n[[J. R. D. Tata|JRD Tata]] was made Chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, and manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tata-Group|title=Tata Group {{!}} History, Companies, Subsidiaries, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, JRD founded an airline, known as [[Air India|Tata Air Services]] (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from [[Tata Sons]], though JRD Tata would continue as Chairman till 1977.\n\nIn 1945, [[Tata Motors]] was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with [[Daimler-Benz]]. In 1968, [[Tata Consultancy Services]] was founded.\n\n=== From 1991 till present ===\nIn 1991, [[Ratan Tata]] was made Chairman of Tata Group.

In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further he bought a bankrupt oil mill at [[Chinchpokli]] and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after 2 years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at [[Nagpur]] named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving 4 goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution and a hydro-electric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Hotel]] at [[Colaba]] waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in India.\n\n=== 1904\u20131938 ===\nAfter Jamsetji's death, his older son [[Dorabji Tata]] became the Chairman in 1904. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel company (TISCO), now known as [[Tata Steel]] in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in [[London]]. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to [[Tata Power]]. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first batch admitted in 1911.\n\n=== 1938\u20131991 ===\n[[J. R. D. Tata|JRD Tata]] was made Chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, and manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tata-Group|title=Tata Group {{!}} History, Companies, Subsidiaries, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, JRD founded an airline, known as [[Air India|Tata Air Services]] (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from [[Tata Sons]], though JRD Tata would continue as Chairman till 1977.\n\nIn 1945, [[Tata Motors]] was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with [[Daimler-Benz]]. In 1968, [[Tata Consultancy Services]] was founded.\n\n=== From 1991 till present ===\nIn 1991, [[Ratan Tata]] was made Chairman of Tata Group.
