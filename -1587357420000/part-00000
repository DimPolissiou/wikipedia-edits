It is bordered by [[India]]\u2019s [[Nagaland]], [[Manipur]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] States to the north, [[Kachin State]], [[Shan State]], and [[Mandalay Region]] to the east, Mandalay Region and [[Magway Region]] to the south, with the [[Ayeyarwady River]] forming a greater part of its eastern and also southern boundary, and [[Chin State]] and India to the west. The region has an area of 93,527&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In 1996, it had a population of over 5,300,000 while its population in 2012 was 6,600,000. The urban population in 2012 was 1,230,000 and the rural population was 5,360,000.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/68newsm.pdf Page 3 Col 1</ref> The capital city of Sagaing Region is [[Sagaing]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Pyu people|Pyu]] were the first to in recorded history to populate the area of Sagaing Region by the 1st century CE. The [[Bamar|Burmans]] first migrated into Upper Myanmar by 9th century CE. The area came under the [[Pagan Kingdom]] certainly by the middle of 11th century when King [[Anawrahta]] (r. 1044\u20131077) founded the Pagan Empire, which encompasses the modern day Myanmar.\n\nAfter the fall of Pagan in 1287, the northwestern parts of Upper Myanmar came under the [[Sagaing Kingdom]] (1315\u20131364) ruled by Burmanized [[Shan people|Shan]] kings. The area was ruled by the kings of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] from 1364 to 1555 and the kings of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]] from 1555 to 1752. [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752\u20131885), founded by king [[Alaungpaya]] in [[Shwebo]], became the last Burmese dynasty before the [[British Empire|British]] conquest of Upper Burma in 1885. The area became Sagaing Division after the Burmese independence in January 1948.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nSagaing Region consists of 10 districts divided into 34 townships<ref name=\"MIMU001\">[http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs6/MIMU001_A3_SD%20&%20Township%20Overview.pdf \"Myanmar States/Divisions & Townships Overview Map\"] Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)</ref> with  198 wards and villages. The major cities are [[Monywa]], [[Shwebo]], [[Sagaing]], [[Ye U]], [[Katha, Burma|Katha]], [[Kalaymyo|Kale]], [[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]], [[Mawlaik]] and [[Hkamti District|Hkamti]]. [[Mingun]] with its famous bell is located near Sagaing but can be reached across the Ayeyarwady from [[Mandalay]].

[[Shan people|Shan]] live in the upper [[Chindwin River]] valley. A sizable minority of [[Naga people|Naga]] resides in the north of [[Naga Hills|north-west mountain ranges]] and [[Zo people|Kuki which includes the Thadou]] in the south. Smaller ethnic groups native to the Region include the [[Kadu people|Kadu]] and [[Ganan language|Ganang]], who live in the upper [[Mu River]] valley and Meza River valley. There are also an unknown number of [[Catholic Church in Myanmar|Catholic]] [[Bayingyi people]] (at least 3,000), the descendants of 16th and 17th century Portuguese adventurers and mercenaries, who live in their ancestral villages on the expansive plains of the [[Mu River]] valley.\n\n==Ecology==\nThere are a number of protected areas in Sagaing Region, among them are [[Alaungdaw Kathapa|Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park]], [[Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary]],<ref>Aung, Myint (2001) \"Ecology and Social Organization of a Tropical Deer (''Cervus Eldi Thamin'')\" ''Journal of Mammalogy'' 82(3): pp.  836\u2013847, {{doi|10.1644/1545-1542(2001)082<0836:EASOOA>2.0.CO;2}}</ref> [[Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary]],<ref>[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&sid=16314&m=0 \"Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary\"] BirdLife IBA Factsheet</ref><ref>Brockelman, Warren Y.

Much of the inland Sagaing Region relies on roads and rail in poor condition.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the chief occupation. The leading crop is [[rice]], which occupies most of the arable ground. Other crops include [[wheat]], [[sesame]], [[peanut]], [[pulses]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]]. The region being next to India, depends on the export import business from India. It is the gateway to India for Myanmar. Sagaing is Myanmar\u2019s leading producer of wheat, contributing more than 80% of the country's total production. Forestry is important in the wetter upper regions along the [[Chindwin River]], with [[teak]] and other hardwoods extracted. As in other parts of the country, [[reforestation]] is not effective enough to maintain [[sustainable forestry]]. Important minerals include [[gold]], [[coal]], [[salt]] and small amounts of [[petroleum]]. Industry includes textiles, [[copper]] refining, gold smelting, and a [[diesel engine]] plant. The Region has many rice mills, [[edible oil]] mills, saw mills, cotton mills, and mechanized weaving factories. Local industry includes earthen pots, silverware, bronze-wares, iron-wares and [[lacquerware]].\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|List of universities in Sagaing Division}}\n\nEducational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]].

in the north-western part of the country between latitude 21\u00b0 30' north and longitude 94\u00b0 97' east. It is bordered by [[India]]\u2019s [[Nagaland]], [[Manipur]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] States to the north, [[Kachin State]], [[Shan State]], and [[Mandalay Region]] to the east, Mandalay Region and [[Magway Region]] to the south, with the [[Ayeyarwady River]] forming a greater part of its eastern and also southern boundary, and [[Chin State]] and India to the west. The region has an area of 93,527&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In 1996, it had a population of over 5,300,000 while its population in 2012 was 6,600,000. The urban population in 2012 was 1,230,000 and the rural population was 5,360,000.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/68newsm.pdf Page 3 Col 1</ref> The capital city of Sagaing Region is [[Sagaing]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Pyu people|Pyu]] were the first to in recorded history to populate the area of Sagaing Region by the 1st century CE. The [[Bamar|Burmans]] first migrated into Upper Myanmar by 9th century CE. The area came under the [[Pagan Kingdom]] certainly by the middle of 11th century when King [[Anawrahta]] (r. 1044\u20131077) founded the Pagan Empire, which encompasses the modern day Myanmar.\n\nAfter the fall of Pagan in 1287, the northwestern parts of Upper Myanmar came under the [[Sagaing Kingdom]] (1315\u20131364) ruled by Burmanized [[Shan people|Shan]] kings. The area was ruled by the kings of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] from 1364 to 1555 and the kings of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]] from 1555 to 1752. [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752\u20131885), founded by king [[Alaungpaya]] in [[Shwebo]], became the last Burmese dynasty before the [[British Empire|British]] conquest of Upper Burma in 1885. The area became Sagaing Division after the Burmese independence in January 1948.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nSagaing Region consists of 10 districts divided into 34 townships<ref name=\"MIMU001\">[http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs6/MIMU001_A3_SD%20&%20Township%20Overview.pdf \"Myanmar States/Divisions & Townships Overview Map\"] Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)</ref> with  198 wards and villages.

Smaller ethnic groups native to the Region include the [[Kadu people|Kadu]] and [[Ganan language|Ganang]], who live in the upper [[Mu River]] valley and Meza River valley.

Much of the inland Sagaing Region relies on roads and rail in poor condition.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the chief occupation. The leading crop is [[rice]], which occupies most of the arable ground. Other crops include [[wheat]], [[sesame]], [[peanut]], [[pulses]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]]. The region being next to India, depends on the export import business from India. It is the gateway to India for Myanmar. Sagaing is Myanmar\u2019s leading producer of wheat, contributing more than 80% of the country's total production. Forestry is important in the wetter upper regions along the [[Chindwin River]], with [[teak]] and other hardwoods extracted. As in other parts of the country, [[reforestation]] is not effective enough to maintain [[sustainable forestry]]. Important minerals include [[gold]], [[coal]], [[salt]] and small amounts of [[petroleum]]. Industry includes textiles, [[copper]] refining, gold smelting, and a [[diesel engine]] plant. The Region has many rice mills, [[edible oil]] mills, saw mills, cotton mills, and mechanized weaving factories. Local industry includes earthen pots, silverware, bronze-wares, iron-wares and [[lacquerware]].\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|List of universities in Sagaing Division}}\n\nEducational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]].

[[Monywa University]] is the main [[liberal arts]] university in the region.\n\n==Healthcare==\nThe general state of healthcare in Myanmar is poor.
