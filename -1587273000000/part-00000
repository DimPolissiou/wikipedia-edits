The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] and [[Indian Gorkha]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools.

Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814\u20131816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]]. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's [[Bowie knife]].<ref>Stoker, Dacre and Ian Holt (2009).

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit's situation report. It reads: \"Enemy losses: ten killed, our nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.\"<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey (1992).

Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some [https://www.thegurkhakhukuri.com/ kukri] (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe [https://www.thegurkhakhukuri.com/ kukri] is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://https://www.thegurkhakhukuri.com/product-category/nepal-army-and-police-kukri//website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile.

The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] and [[Indian Gorkha]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools.

Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]]. He wears the distinctively tilted [[Hat Terrai Gurkha]], the kukri can be seen attached to the back of his belt]]\nThe Biswakarma [[Kami (caste)]] are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making.<ref name=\"kami\">{{Cite web|url=https://himalayan-imports.com/kami.html|title=Kamis, Khukuri makers of Nepal|website=himalayan-imports.com|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> Modern kukri blades are often forged from [[spring steel]], sometimes collected from recycled [[Suspension (vehicle)|truck suspension units]].<ref name=\"kami\"/> The [[tang (tools)|tang]] of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\n\n==Anatomy==\n===Blade===\n* Keeper (''Hira Jornu''): Spade/Diamond shaped metal/brass plate used to seal the butt cap.\n* Butt Cap (''Chapri''): Thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang.\n* Tang (''Paro''): Rear piece of the blade that goes through the handle.\n* Bolster (''Kanjo''): Thick metal/brass round shaped plate between blade and handle made to support and reinforce the fixture.\n* Spine (''Beet''): Thickest blunt edge of the blade.\n* Fuller/Groove (''Khol''): Straight groove or deep line that runs along part of the upper spine.\n* Peak (''Juro''): Highest point of the blade.\n* Main body (''Ang''): Main surface or panel of the blade.\n* Fuller (''Chirra''): Curvature/Hump in the blade made to absorb impact and to reduce unnecessary weight.\n* Tip (''Toppa''): the Starting point of the blade.\n* Edge (''Dhaar''): Sharp edge of the blade.\n* Belly (''Bhundi''): Widest part/area of the blade.\n* Bevel (''Patti''): Slope from the main body until the sharp edge.\n* Notch (''Cho''): A distinctive cut (numeric '3 '-like shape) in the edge. Used as a stopper when sharpening with the chakmak.\n* Ricasso (''Ghari''): Blunt area between the notch and bolster.\n* Rings (''Harhari''): Round circles in the handle.\n* Rivet (''Khil''): Steel or metal bolt to fasten or secure tang to the handle.\n* Tang Tail (''Puchchar''): Last point of the kukri blade.\n\n===Scabbard===\n* Frog (''Faras''): Belt holder specially made of thick leather (2&nbsp; mm to 4&nbsp; mm) encircling the scabbard close towards the throat.\n* Upper Edge (''Mathillo Bhaag''): Spine of the scabbard where holding should be done when handling a kukri.\n* Lace (''Tuna''): A leather cord used to sew or attach two ends of the frog. Especially used in army types.\n* Main Body (''Sharir''): The main body or surface of the scabbard. Generally made in semi oval shape.\n* Chape (''Khothi''): Pointed metallic tip of the scabbard. Used to protect the naked tip of a scabbard.\n* Loop (''Golie''): Round leather room/space where a belt goes through attached/fixed to the keeper with steel rivets.\n* Throat (''Mauri''): Entrance towards the interior of the scabbard for the blade.\n* Strap/Ridge (''Bhunti''): Thick raw leather encircling the scabbard made to create a hump to secure the frog from moving or wobbling (not available in this pic).\n* Lower Edge (''Tallo Bhag''): Belly/curvature of the scabbard.\n\n==Classification==\nKukris can be broadly classified into two types: Eastern and Western. The Eastern blades are originated and named according to the towns and villages of [[Eastern Nepal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} The Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as ''Siru'' grass leaf like.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kukrimart.com | title=Kukri Mart - Handmade Genuine Gurkhas Knives and original Nepalese Khukuris}}</ref> Khukuris made in locations like [[Chainpur, Kosi|Chainpur]], [[Bhojpur, Nepal|Bhojpur]], and [[Dhankuta]] in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.<ref>Visit Nepal '98: By The Official Travel Manual of Visit Nepal '98 VNY'98 Secretariat, 1998</ref>\nWestern blades are generally broader. Occasionally the Western style is called ''Budhuna'', (referring to a fish with a large head), or ''baspate'' (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal ''Sirupate'' blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.\n\nThere is Khukuri named after Gorkhali General [[Amar Singh Thapa]] called '''Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri'''. This Khukuri is modelled on the real Khukuri used by the Gorkhali General.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bladeforums.com/threads/wednesday-evening-with-amar-singh-thapa-khukuri.674412/|title= Wednesday evening with Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri|website=bladeforums.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> The real Khukuri used by Amar Singh Thapa is archived at [[National Museum of Nepal]] and is more curvy in nature than other traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/7881368076018402/|title= Weapons (Kukri, Katar, Kora) of Amar Singh Thapa in National Museum of Nepal, Kathmandu |website=pinterest.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThere is a popular proverb in Nepali{{citation needed}} as follows:\n\n{{Quote|Sirupate Khukuri ma Laha chha ki chhaina?<br>Translation: Does your Sirupate Khukuri have enough iron?}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bagh nakh]]\n* [[Falcata]]\n* [[Husa knife]]\n* [[Katar (dagger)|Katar]]\n* [[Khopesh]]\n* [[Kopis]]\n* [[Parang (knife)]]\n* [[Pata (sword)]]\n*[[Gurkha]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Kukri}}\n\n{{Knives}}\n\n[[Category:Blade weapons]]\n[[Category:Gurkhas]]\n[[Category:Military knives]]\n[[Category:Nepalese culture]]\n", "name_user": "Biganpathak", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukri"}

On completing his training, Singh was posted to the regiment's 1st Battalion. During late 1942, the battalion was deployed to the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u20131943|Arakan]] Province{{efn|Now [[Rakhine State]].}} during the [[Burma campaign]], where they fought against the Japanese. The battalion was part of the [[47th Indian Infantry Brigade]], assigned to the [[14th Indian Infantry Division]]. It fought actions around the Mayu Range in late 1942 and early 1943, advancing up the Mayu Peninsula towards Donbaik as part of an operation to recapture [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]]. Although the Rajputs were held up around the cluster of villages called [[Kondan (disambiguation)|Kondan]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> in December 1942, the advance slowly continued towards Donbaik. It was there, where the brigade's attack ground to a halt and they were subsequently relieved by the [[55th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in early February 1943. In early April, the Japanese counterattacked.  The 47th Brigade became cut off around Indan and eventually split off into small groups to fight their way back to Allied lines. The surviving members of the brigade returned to India.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2013|pp=41&ndash;42}}{{sfn|Allen|2000|pp=97&ndash;109}} In 1945, Singh's battalion was assigned to the [[2nd Indian Infantry Brigade]] and took over the defence of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. The islands had been partially occupied by the Japanese forces, which surrendered on 7 October 1945.{{Sfn|Jackson|2006|p=89}}{{Sfn|Suryanarayan|1994|p=158}} After returning to India, Singh was promoted to the rank of [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]] ([[corporal]]). After the [[partition of India|partition]], the 7th Rajput Regiment was assigned to the Indian Army. Singh remained with the newly raised Indian regiment, continuing to serve in its 1st Battalion.{{Sfn|Reddy|2007|pp=24\u201325}}\n\n===War of 1947===\n{{main article|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\nIn October 1947, following an offensive by the Pakistani raiders in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet directed the Army Headquarters to undertake a military response. The Army planned several operations to drive out the raiders as directed. In one such operation, the [[Para (Special Forces)|50th Para Brigade]], to which the [[Rajput Regiment]] was attached, was ordered to secure [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushahra]] and establish a base at Jhangar in mid-November.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=46}}\n\nBad weather prevented this action and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous position in the Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Poonch (town)Poonch]] and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. [[Brigadier]] [[Mohammad Usman]], the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=56\u201357}}<ref name=\"10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery\">{{cite web|title=10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/40239/indian-army-heroes/|agency=The Better India|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=15 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927052531/http://www.thebetterindia.com/40239/indian-army-heroes/|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTain Dhar, lying to the north of Naushahra, was one such approach for which Singh's battalion was responsible. On the morning of 6 February 1948, at 6:40&nbsp;am [[Indian Standard Time|IST]], Pakistani forces opened fire on pickets from the battalion patrolling along Tain Dhar ridge. Gunfire was exchanged between both sides. The foggy early morning darkness helped the attacking Pakistanis creep up to the pickets.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=48}} Soon, men in the posts on the Tain Dhar ridge observed a large number of Pakistani soldiers moving towards them. Singh was in command of the nine personnel manning the forward post of the second picket at Tain Dhar. Singh and his section were able to ward off three successive attempts by Pakistani forces to capture their position.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=56\u201357}}<ref name=\"10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery\"/> By the end of third wave, of the 27 men at the post, 24 were dead or severely wounded. Singh being a section commander at the post, displayed \"exemplary\" leadership, and kept motivating his men till he succumbed to his wounds.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=48}} This proved a very critical moment for the battle at Naushahra. In the meantime, Brigadier Usman sent a company of the 3rd (Para) Battalion, Rajput Regiment, to reinforce Tain Dhar. Without Singh engaging the Pakistani troops for a considerable period, re-capture of these posts would have been impossible.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=49}}\n\n==== Param Vir Chakra====\nSingh was posthumously awarded the India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra for his actions on 6 February 1948.<ref name=\"Nk Jadunath Singh, PVC, Summary  @ TWDI\">{{cite web|title=Nk Jadunath Singh, PVC (Details)|url=http://twdi.in/node/491|agency=The War Decorated India & Trust|accessdate=26 September 2016| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160927180024/http://twdi.in/node/491| archive-date =27 September 2016| url-status =dead}}</ref> The official citation is as follows:\n{{Quotation|\nAt No 2 picquet on Taindhar on 6 February 1948, No 27373 Naik Jadunath Singh was in command of a forward section post, which bore the full brunt of the enemy attack. Nine men against overwhelming odds garrisoned the little post. The enemy launched its attack in successive waves and with great ferocity to overcome this post. The first wave swept up to the post in a furious attack. Displaying great valour and superb qualities of leadership Naik Jadunath Singh so used the small force at his disposal that the enemy retired in utter confusion. Four of his men were wounded but Naik Jadunath Singh again showed his qualities of good leadership by reorganising the battered force under him, for meeting another onslaught. His coolness and courage were of such an order that the men rallied and were ready for the second attack which came with greater determination and in larger number than the preceding one. Though hopelessly outnumbered, this post under the gallant leadership of Naik Jadunath Singh resisted. All were wounded, and Naik Jadunath Singh, though wounded in the right arm, personally took over the [[Bren gun]] from the wounded Bren gunner. The enemy was right on the walls of the post but Naik Jadunath Singh once again showed outstanding ability and valour of the highest order in action. By his complete disregard for his personal safety and example of coolness and courage, he encouraged his men to fight. His fire was so devastating, that what looked like impending defeat was turned into a victory and the enemy retreated in chaos leaving the dead and wounded littered on the ground. With this act of supreme heroism and outstanding example of leadership and determination, Naik Jadunath Singh saved the post from the second assault. By this time, all men in the post were casualties. The enemy put in his third and final attack in undiminished numbers and determination to capture this post. Naik Jadunath Singh, now wounded, prepared literally single-handed to give battle for the third time. With great courage and determination, he came out of the [[Sangar (fortification)|sangar]]{{efn|A sangar is a small protected structure used for observing or firing from, which is built up from the ground.<ref name=\"Definition of SANGAR\">{{cite web|title=Definition of Sangar|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sangar|agency=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url-access=subscription |accessdate=26 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430130614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sangar|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}} and finally with the Sten gun, made a most magnificent single-handed charge on the advancing enemy, who, completely taken by surprise, fled in disorder. Naik Jadunath Singh, however, met his gallant death in his third and last charge when two bullets hit him in the head and chest.

Singh never married.{{Sfn|Reddy|2007|p=24}}\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Jadunath Memorial at Taindhar Top near Naushera J&K.jpg|thumb|Naik Jadunath Singh Memorial at Taindhar Top near Naushera J&K]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Singh enlisted in the [[7th Rajput Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]], on 21 November 1941 at [[Fatehgarh]] Regimental Centre. On completing his training, Singh was posted to the regiment's 1st Battalion. During late 1942, the battalion was deployed to the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u20131943|Arakan]] Province{{efn|Now [[Rakhine State]].}} during the [[Burma campaign]], where they fought against the Japanese. The battalion was part of the [[47th Indian Infantry Brigade]], assigned to the [[14th Indian Infantry Division]]. It fought actions around the Mayu Range in late 1942 and early 1943, advancing up the Mayu Peninsula towards Donbaik as part of an operation to recapture [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]]. Although the Rajputs were held up around the cluster of villages called [[Kondan (disambiguation)|Kondan]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> in December 1942, the advance slowly continued towards Donbaik. It was there, where the brigade's attack ground to a halt and they were subsequently relieved by the [[55th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in early February 1943. In early April, the Japanese counterattacked.  The 47th Brigade became cut off around Indan and eventually split off into small groups to fight their way back to Allied lines. The surviving members of the brigade returned to India.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2013|pp=41&ndash;42}}{{sfn|Allen|2000|pp=97&ndash;109}} In 1945, Singh's battalion was assigned to the [[2nd Indian Infantry Brigade]] and took over the defence of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. The islands had been partially occupied by the Japanese forces, which surrendered on 7 October 1945.{{Sfn|Jackson|2006|p=89}}{{Sfn|Suryanarayan|1994|p=158}} After returning to India, Singh was promoted to the rank of [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]] ([[corporal]]). After the [[partition of India|partition]], the 7th Rajput Regiment was assigned to the Indian Army. Singh remained with the newly raised Indian regiment, continuing to serve in its 1st Battalion.{{Sfn|Reddy|2007|pp=24\u201325}}\n\n===War of 1947===\n{{main article|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\nIn October 1947, following an offensive by the Pakistani raiders in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet directed the Army Headquarters to undertake a military response. The Army planned several operations to drive out the raiders as directed. In one such operation, the [[Para (Special Forces)|50th Para Brigade]], to which the [[Rajput Regiment]] was attached, was ordered to secure [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushahra]] and establish a base at Jhangar in mid-November.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=46}}\n\nBad weather prevented this action and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous position in the Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Poonch (town)Poonch]] and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. [[Brigadier]] [[Mohammad Usman]], the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=56\u201357}}<ref name=\"10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery\">{{cite web|title=10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/40239/indian-army-heroes/|agency=The Better India|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=15 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927052531/http://www.thebetterindia.com/40239/indian-army-heroes/|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTain Dhar, lying to the north of Naushahra, was one such approach for which Singh's battalion was responsible. On the morning of 6 February 1948, at 6:40&nbsp;am [[Indian Standard Time|IST]], Pakistani forces opened fire on pickets from the battalion patrolling along Tain Dhar ridge. Gunfire was exchanged between both sides. The foggy early morning darkness helped the attacking Pakistanis creep up to the pickets.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=48}} Soon, men in the posts on the Tain Dhar ridge observed a large number of Pakistani soldiers moving towards them. Singh was in command of the nine personnel manning the forward post of the second picket at Tain Dhar. Singh and his section were able to ward off three successive attempts by Pakistani forces to capture their position.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=56\u201357}}<ref name=\"10 Army Heroes and Their Extra Ordinary Tales of Bravery\"/> By the end of third wave, of the 27 men at the post, 24 were dead or severely wounded. Singh being a section commander at the post, displayed \"exemplary\" leadership, and kept motivating his men till he succumbed to his wounds.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=48}} This proved a very critical moment for the battle at Naushahra. In the meantime, Brigadier Usman sent a company of the 3rd (Para) Battalion, Rajput Regiment, to reinforce Tain Dhar. Without Singh engaging the Pakistani troops for a considerable period, re-capture of these posts would have been impossible.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=49}}\n\n==== Param Vir Chakra====\nSingh was posthumously awarded the India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra for his actions on 6 February 1948.<ref name=\"Nk Jadunath Singh, PVC, Summary  @ TWDI\">{{cite web|title=Nk Jadunath Singh, PVC (Details)|url=http://twdi.in/node/491|agency=The War Decorated India & Trust|accessdate=26 September 2016| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160927180024/http://twdi.in/node/491| archive-date =27 September 2016| url-status =dead}}</ref> The official citation is as follows:\n{{Quotation|\nAt No 2 picquet on Taindhar on 6 February 1948, No 27373 Naik Jadunath Singh was in command of a forward section post, which bore the full brunt of the enemy attack. Nine men against overwhelming odds garrisoned the little post. The enemy launched its attack in successive waves and with great ferocity to overcome this post. The first wave swept up to the post in a furious attack. Displaying great valour and superb qualities of leadership Naik Jadunath Singh so used the small force at his disposal that the enemy retired in utter confusion. Four of his men were wounded but Naik Jadunath Singh again showed his qualities of good leadership by reorganising the battered force under him, for meeting another onslaught. His coolness and courage were of such an order that the men rallied and were ready for the second attack which came with greater determination and in larger number than the preceding one. Though hopelessly outnumbered, this post under the gallant leadership of Naik Jadunath Singh resisted. All were wounded, and Naik Jadunath Singh, though wounded in the right arm, personally took over the [[Bren gun]] from the wounded Bren gunner. The enemy was right on the walls of the post but Naik Jadunath Singh once again showed outstanding ability and valour of the highest order in action. By his complete disregard for his personal safety and example of coolness and courage, he encouraged his men to fight. His fire was so devastating, that what looked like impending defeat was turned into a victory and the enemy retreated in chaos leaving the dead and wounded littered on the ground. With this act of supreme heroism and outstanding example of leadership and determination, Naik Jadunath Singh saved the post from the second assault. By this time, all men in the post were casualties. The enemy put in his third and final attack in undiminished numbers and determination to capture this post. Naik Jadunath Singh, now wounded, prepared literally single-handed to give battle for the third time. With great courage and determination, he came out of the [[Sangar (fortification)|sangar]]{{efn|A sangar is a small protected structure used for observing or firing from, which is built up from the ground.<ref name=\"Definition of SANGAR\">{{cite web|title=Definition of Sangar|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sangar|agency=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url-access=subscription |accessdate=26 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430130614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sangar|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}} and finally with the Sten gun, made a most magnificent single-handed charge on the advancing enemy, who, completely taken by surprise, fled in disorder.
