They served as elected representatives in the [[Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Sejm]] (National Parliament) and in local ''[[Sejmiki]]'' assemblies, appointing officials and overseeing judicial and financial governance, including tax-raising, at the provincial level.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates). Socially they were not a distinct class from the rycerstwo from which they all originated<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\">{{cite book\n | last = Dmowski\n | first = Roman Stanis\u0142aw\n | authorlink = Roman Dmowski\n | editor-last = Duff\n | editor-first = James Duff\n | editor-link = James Duff Duff\n | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/RussianRealitiesAndProblems\n | title = RUSSIAN REALITIES & PROBLEMS\n | year = 1917\n | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n | location = Cambridge, East of England, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM\n | page = 94\n | chapter = Poland, Old And New\n | quote = But between the gentry and the magnates there was only a difference of wealth and culture.

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence. These mo\u017cni (Magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority.<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|75, 76}} In [[Gallus Anonymus|Gall Anonym's]] chronicle, there is noted the nobility's alarm when the [[Count palatine|Palatine]] [[Sieciech]] \"elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born\" entrusting them with state offices. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=149}}\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Lithuanian nobility}}\n[[File:Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II)]]]]\nIn [[Lithuania Propria]] and in [[Samogitia]], prior to the creation of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] by [[Mindaugas]], nobles were called ''die beste leuten'' in [[German language|German]] sources. In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected. Major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility occurred after various sanctions were imposed by the [[Russian Empire]], such as removing ''Lithuania'' from the names of the ''Gubernyas'' shortly after the [[November Uprising]].<ref name=\"Ochma\u0144ski\">{{cite book |last=Ochma\u0144ski |first=Jerzy |title=The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation |publisher=Mickiewicz University |year=1986 |location=Pozna\u0144}}</ref> After the [[January Uprising]] the sanctions went further, and Russian officials announced that \"Lithuanians were actually Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism\" and began to intensify [[Lithuanian press ban#Origins and legal basis|russification]], and to [[Lithuanian press ban|ban]] the printing of books in Lithuanian.\n\n==== Ruthenia ====\n{{Main|Ruthenian nobility}}\nAfter the principalities of [[Halych]] and [[Volhynia]] became integrated with the Grand Duchy, [[Ruthenia]]'s nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural [[melting pot]] that was the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

[retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Only in the [[Russian Partition]] did peasants pay the market price for land redemption, the average for the rest of the [[Russian Empire]] was 34% above the market rates. All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for [[absolute monarchy]], in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the [[political system]] to evolve into an [[oligarchy]].\n\nSzlachta members were also proportionately more numerous than their equivalents in all other European countries, constituting 6\u201312% of the entire population.<ref name=\"Frost\" />{{Ref label|a|a|none}} By contrast, nobles in other European countries, except for Spain, amounted to a mere 1\u20133%.

Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility.

But where there has been an intrusion of a dominant people, or settlers, who have not fused into the original population, there we find an exact counterpart of Polish society: the dominant settlers establishing themselves as an upper caste, all politically equal among themselves, and holding the lands (or, more frequently, simply drawing the rents) of the country.<ref name=\"races-old-world\" />{{rp|483}}}}\n\nSociologist and historian, [[Jerzy Szacki|Jerzy Ryszard Szacki]] said in this context,\n\n{{quote|text=... the Polish nobility was a closed group (apart from a few exceptions, many of which were contrary to the law), in which membership was inherited.<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" />}}\nOthers assert the szlachta were not a [[social class]], but a [[caste]], among them, historian [[Adam Zamoyski]],\n\n{{quote|text=A more apt analogy might perhaps be made with the [[Rajput]]s of northern India. ... unlike any other gentry in Europe, the szlachta was not limited by nor did it depend for its status on either wealth, or land, or royal writ.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. The remaining 15% were made up of a substantial minority of Jews.<ref>Kuklo C.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The second theory involved a presumed szlachta descent from [[Japheth]], one of [[Noah]]'s sons.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

Young's reaction to hearing of this was, \"I never liked that verse anyway\", and it has never been performed live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2919|title=Cortez the Killer by Neil Young Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Danger Bird\" interpolates sections of an unreleased song relating to Young's breakup with [[Carrie Snodgress]] called \"L.A. Girls and Ocean Boys\", specifically the line \"'Cause you've been with another man / there you are and here I am.\"<ref>Jimmy McDonough. ''Shakey: Neil Young's Biography.''
