The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\nFor many foreigners, the history of Afghanistan reads like a morose, Shakespearean tragedy. A litany of armies ventured into the fabled \"graveyard of empires,\" sometimes well-intentioned, only to face insurmountable challenges and withdraw in humiliating defeat. Without a doubt, the quintessential Afghan tragedy is the First Anglo-Afghan War, the subject of Diana Preston's book, The Dark Defile: Britain's Catastrophic Invasion of Afghanistan, 1878-1880.\n \nAs Kabul and growing parts of the country rose up in rebellion, the British embarked on an inglorious retreat in January 1880 led by Sir William Hay Macnaghten, Britain's chief representative to Kabul, and Major General William Elphinstone, commander of the British Army in Afghanistan. The British-led force, which numbered about 4,500 soldiers and included a large contingent of Indian sepoys, was eviscerated as it battled through biting cold, knee-deep snow and apoplectic tribesmen. Dr. William Brydon, the lone European survivor to reach the British fort at Jalalabad, later recalled: \"This was a terrible march, the fire of the enemy incessant, and numbers of officers and men, not knowing where they were going from snow-blindness, were cut up.\"\n \nThe Dark Defile, whose title comes from the lines of a Rudyard Kipling poem, is an impressive book, and Preston relies on primary sources to tell an intriguing story from the British perspective. It is not as comprehensive as the classics by such historians as John William Kaye, whose History of the War in Afghanistan remains a paradigmatic account of the British experience, but it is well sourced and well written.\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain. The British Army then withdrew.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=71}}</ref>\n\nHowever, on 3 September 1879 an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Sir Louis Cavagnari]], the British representative, along with his guards, and staff \u2013 provoking the next phase of the Second Afghan War.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |page=15}}</ref>\n\n===Second phase===\n[[File:Elephant and Mule Battery (\"Dignity & Impudence\") WDL11496.png|thumb|Titled \"Dignity & Impudence\" for [[stereotype|stereotypic]] [[personality trait]]s of elephants and mules respectively, this photograph by [[John Burke (photographer)|John Burke]] shows an elephant and mule battery during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

{"title_page": "Motorcycle transmission", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:Abc-engine.jpg|thumb|The transmission on this 1921 [[ABC Motorcycle|ABC motorcycle]] is located behind the engine and shifts by a long hand-operated lever on its right side.]]\nA '''motorcycle transmission''' is a [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] created specifically for [[motorcycle]] applications. They may also be found in use on other light vehicles such as [[motor tricycle]]s and [[quadbike]]s, [[go-kart]]s offroad buggies, [[auto rickshaw]]s, mowers and other utility vehicles, [[microcar]]s, and even some superlight racing cars.\n\n==Manual==\nMost manual transmission two-wheelers use a [[sequential gearbox]]. Most modern motorcycles (except scooters) change gears (of which they increasingly have five or six) by foot lever. On a typical motorcycle either first or second gear can be directly selected from neutral, but higher gears may only be accessed in order \u2013 it is not possible to shift from second gear to fourth gear without shifting through third gear. A five-speed of this configuration would be known as \"one down, four up\" because of the placement of the gears with relation to neutral, though some motorcycle gearboxes and/or shift mechanisms can be reversed so that a \"one up, four down\" shifting pattern can be used. Neutral is to be found \"half a click\" away from first and second gears, so shifting directly between the two gears can be made in a single movement.\n\n==Automatic==\nAutomatic transmissions are less common on motorcycles than manual, and are mostly found only on scooters and some custom cruisers and exotic sports bikes. Types include: [[continuously variable transmission]], [[automated manual transmission]] and [[dual clutch transmission]].<ref>[[https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering Motorcycle Power-train Engineering - RICARDO]]</ref>\n\n==Reverse gear==\nThe weight of the largest touring motorcycles (sometimes in excess of 360&nbsp;kg or 800&nbsp;lbs) is sometimes such that they cannot effectively be pushed backwards by a seated rider, and they are fitted with a reverse gear as standard. In some cases, including the [[Honda Gold Wing]] and [[BMW motorcycles|BMW K1200LT]], this is not really a reverse gear, but a feature of the starter motor which when reversed, performs the same function. To avoid accidental operation, reverse is often engaged using an entirely separate control switch - e.g. a pull-toggle at the head of the fuel tank - when the main gearshift is in neutral.\n\n==Shift control==\nIn earlier times (pre-WWII), hand-operated gear changes were common, with a lever provided to the side of the fuel tank (above the rider's leg). British and many other motorcycles after World War II used a lever on the right (with brake on the left), but today gear-changing is standardised on a foot-operated lever to the left.\n\n==Scooters, underbones and miniatures==\nTraditional scooters (such as the [[Vespa]]) still have manual gear-changing by a [[twist grip]] on the left hand side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated clutch lever. Modern scooters were often fitted with a throttle-controlled [[continuously variable transmission]], thus earning the term '''twist-and-go'''.\n\n[[Underbone]] and [[Minibike|miniature]] motorcycles often have a three to five-speed foot change, but the clutch is automatic.\n\n==Clutch==\nThe [[clutch]] in a manual-shift motorcycle transmission is typically an arrangement of plates stacked in alternating fashion, one geared on the inside to the engine and the next geared on the outside to the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] input shaft. Whether wet (rotating in engine oil) or dry, the plates are squeezed together by a spring, causing friction build up between the plates until they rotate as a single unit, driving the transmission directly. A lever on the handlebar exploits mechanical advantage through a cable or hydraulic arrangement to release the clutch spring(s), allowing the engine to freewheel with respect to the transmission.\n\nAutomatic and automated manuals (single-clutch & dual-clutch) typically use a [[centrifugal clutch]] which operates in a different fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no \"idle creep\" with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start to make contact with the inside of the outer housing (connected to the gearbox shaft) and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective \"bite point\" is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.\n\nAbove a certain engine speed - when the bike is properly in motion, so the gearbox input shaft is also rotating quickly and so allowing the engine to accelerate further by way of clutch slip - the outward pressure of the weighted friction plates is sufficient that the clutch will enter full lock-up, the same as a conventional plate-clutch with a fully released lever or pedal. After this, there is no clutch slip, and the engine is locked to and providing all of its available power to the transmission; engine rpm is now dependent on the road speed and the current gear ratio (under either user control in a semi-auto, or reliant on road speed (and sometimes load/throttle position) in a CVT setup). In a typical CVT, the gear ratio will be chosen so the engine can reach and maintain its maximum-power speed as soon as possible (or at least, when at full throttle, in a partially load-dependent system), but in a semi-auto the rider is responsible for this choice, and they can ride around all day in top gear (or first) if they so prefer. Also, when the engine is turning fast enough to lock the clutch, it will stay fully engaged until the RPMs fall below that critical point again, even if the throttle is fully released. Below the lock-up point, partially or fully releasing the throttle can lead to the RPM falling off rapidly, thanks to the feedback loop of lower engine speed meaning less friction pressure. This toggle-like mode of operation can lead to certain characteristic centrifugal-clutch-automatic behaviour, such as being able to freewheel rapidly downhill from a standstill, with [[engine braking]] only being triggered by turning the ''throttle'' briefly (and not then cancellable without braking to quite a slow, gear-dependent pace), and lockup triggering at a lower speed with full versus minimal throttle.\n\n==Construction==\n[[Pre-unit construction]], also called separate construction, is a motorcycle engine architecture where the engine and gearbox are separate casings.  In [[unit construction]] the engine and gearbox share a single housing.\n\nIn many modern designs, the engine sits in front of the gearbox. From a sprocket on one side of the crankshaft, a chain or sprocket directly mounted to the clutch will drive the clutch, which can often be found behind a large circular cover on one side of the gearbox. The clutch is connected to the gearbox input shaft. For motorcycles with chain drive, the gearbox output shaft is typically connected to the sprocket which drives the final drive chain.\n\nMost manual motorcycle gearboxes have \"constant mesh\" gears which are always mated but may rotate freely on a shaft until locked by a toothed sliding collar or \"[[Manual transmission#Dog clutch|dog clutch]]\". Since the gears are always rotating and can only be accessed sequentially, [[synchromesh]] is not generally needed. To save space, both shafts may contain a mixture of fixed and free-spinning gears, with some gears built into the sliding parts.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Motorcycle components}}\n\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:Abc-engine.jpg|thumb|The transmission on this 1921 [[ABC Motorcycle|ABC motorcycle]] is located behind the engine and shifts by a long hand-operated lever on its right side.]]\nA '''motorcycle transmission''' is a [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] created specifically for [[motorcycle]] applications.

Along with the rest of the North Tyneside electric network it was de-electrified in 1967, and converted to [[diesel multiple unit]] operation.<ref name=\"SRT\"/>\n\n===Rundown and closure===\nFrom 1909 until 1948 an hourly all day service ran on the line, however in 1948/49, passenger services on the branch were reduced to peak hours only, to cater for the commuter traffic from the area's shipyards only, and the two least used stations; {{rws|Byker}} and {{rws|St Anthonys}} were closed in 1954, and 1960 respectively. By the early 1970s, traffic on the line had dwindled.<ref name=\"SRT\"/> \n\nThe line closed to passengers on 23 July 1973, the last train having run the previous Friday 20th <ref>http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/carville/</ref> and to goods in stages, Carville Swan Hunter Siding to Percy Main West Junction in 1978, St Peters Shepherds Scrap Siding to Carville Swan Hunter Siding in 1987, and Riverside Junction to St Peters Shepherds Scrap Siding the next year.<ref name=\"northumbrian-railways1\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[North Tyneside Loop]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n{{coord|54.9817|-1.5389|dim:5000_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:North Eastern Railway (UK)]]\n[[Category:Closed railway lines in North East England]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1879]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Northumberland]]\n[[Category:Railway lines closed in 1988]]\n[[Category:1879 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1988 disestablishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "G-13114", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOpening", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Branch"}
