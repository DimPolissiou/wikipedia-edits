Most of [[Portugal]]'s naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country.  In the initial decades following independence, the country maintained a large naval force and the navy was later involved in the [[Cisplatine War]], the [[List of conflicts in South America|River Plate conflicts]], the [[Paraguayan War]] as well as other sporadic [[List of conflicts in South America|rebellions]] that marked Brazilian history.\n\nBy the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the [[Revolta da Armada|1893 naval rebellion]], there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|two of the most powerful]] and advanced [[dreadnought]]s of the day which sparked a [[South American dreadnought race|dreadnought race with Brazil's South American neighbours]]. The Brazilian Navy participated in both [[Brazil and World War I|World War I]] and [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|World War II]], engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic.\n\nThe modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile [[frigate]]s (FFG), locally built [[corvette]]s (FFL), coastal diesel-electric [[submarine]]s (SSK) and many other river and coastal patrol craft.\n\n==Mission==\nIn addition to the roles of a traditional [[navy]], the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the [[merchant navy]] and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a [[coast guard]]. Other roles include:\n* Conducting national maritime policy\n* Implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragata_Nictheroy.jpg|thumb|left|Frigate ''Nictheroy'' chasing the Portuguese fleet during the war of independence.]]\n[[File:Marquis of tamandare 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|Patron of the Brazilian Navy [[Joaquim Marques Lisboa, Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9]], in 1873.]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Brazilian Navy date back to the [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese naval forces]] based in Brazil. The transfer of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese monarchy]] to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars also resulted in the transfer of a large part of the structure, personnel and ships of the Portuguese Navy. These became the core of the Navy of Brazil.\n\n===Imperial Navy (1822\u20131889)===\n{{Main |Imperial Brazilian Navy}}\n\n====War of Independence====\n{{Main |Independence of Brazil#Independence War}}\n[[File:Treino da armada brasileira 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ships of the Imperial Navy in training, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro, 1870s.]]\nThe Brazilian Navy came into being with the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of the country]]. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portuguese rule had been forbidden to serve, while other members were Portuguese born who adhered to the cause of independence and foreign mercenaries. A number of establishments previously created by King [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]] were incorporated into the navy such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the Supreme Military Council, the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha Moreira]] was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 260}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 53}}\n\nBritish naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane]] was made the commander of the Brazilian Navy and received the rank of \"First Admiral\".{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 58\u201361}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}  At that time, the fleet was composed of one [[ship of the line]], four [[frigate]]s, and smaller ships for a total of 38 [[warship]]s. The Secretary of Treasury [[Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada]] created a national subscription to generate capital in order to increase the size of the fleet. Contributions were sent from all over Brazil. Even [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] acquired a merchant [[brig]] at his own expense (renamed ''Caboclo'') and donated it to the Navy.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 54\u201357}}  The navy fought in the north and also south of Brazil where it had a decisive role in the independence of the country.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}  After the suppression of the [[Confederation of the Equator|revolt in Pernambuco]] in 1824 and prior to the [[Cisplatine War]], the navy increased significantly in size and strength. Starting with 38 ships in 1822, eventually the navy had 96 modern warships of various types with over 690 cannon.\n\n====Cisplatine War and rebellions (1825\u20131849)====\n{{Main|Cisplatine War}}\n[[File:Passage_of_tonelero.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian warships ''Dom Pedro'', ''Dom Pedro II'', ''Dom Afonso'', ''Recife'', ''Dona Francisca'', ''Uni\u00e3o'' and ''Cal\u00edope'' passing through defences at The Tonelero.]]\nThe Navy blocked the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] hindering the contact of the United Provinces (as Argentina was then called) with the Cisplatine rebels who wanted Uruguay to join Argentina again or become an independent country, and the outside world. Several battles had occurred between Brazilian and Argentine ships until the defeat of an Argentine flotilla composed of two [[corvette]]s, five brigs and one [[barquentine]] near the Island of Santiago in 1827. The war came to a draw and in 1828 had to accept the independence of Uruguay. When Pedro I abdicated in 1831, he left a powerful navy made up of two ships of the line and ten [[frigate]]s in addition to corvettes, [[steamship]]s, and other ships for a total of at least 80 warships in peacetime.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 133\u201335}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}\n[[File:Steamship_dom_Afonso.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Artistic representation of the steam corvette Imperial ''Dom Afonso'' in 1850]]\nDuring the 58-year reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] the Brazilian Navy achieved its greatest strength in relation to navies around the world.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 216}}  The Arsenal, Navy department, and the Naval Jail were improved and the Imperial Marine Corps was created. Steam navigation was adopted. Brazil quickly modernized its fleet acquiring ships from foreign sources while also constructing ships locally. Brazil's Navy substituted the old [[smoothbore]] cannon for new ones with rifled barrels, which were more accurate and had longer ranges. Improvements were also made in the Arsenals (shipyards) and naval bases, which were equipped with new workshops.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}  Ships were constructed in the Naval Arsenal of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife, Santos, Niter\u00f3i and Pelotas. The Navy also successfully fought against all revolts that occurred during the Regency where it conducted blockades and transported the Army troops; including Cabanagem, [[Ragamuffin War]], [[Sabinada]], [[Balaiada]], amongst others.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 205\u20136}}\n\nWhen Emperor Pedro II was declared of legal age and assumed his constitutional prerogatives in 1840, the Armada had over 90 warships: six frigates, seven corvettes, two barque-schooners, six brigs, eight brig-schooners, 16 [[gunboat]]s, 12 schooners, seven armed brigantine-schooners, six steam [[barque]]s, three transport ships, two armed [[lugger]]s, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s and thirteen larger [[boat]]s.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 210}}\n\nDuring the 1850s the State Secretary, the Accounting Department of the Navy, the Headquarters of the Navy and the Naval Academy were reorganized and improved. New ships were purchased and the ports administrations were better equipped. The Imperial Mariner Corps was definitively regularized and the Marine Corps was created, taking the place of the Naval Artillery. The Service of Assistance for Invalids was also established, along with several schools for sailors and craftsmen.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | pp  = 207\u20138}}\n\n====Platine & Paraguayan wars (1849\u20131870)====\n{{Main|Paraguayan War}}\n\n[[File:O_Alagoas_passando_Humayta.png|thumb|right|A rare photograph of the Brazilian river monitor ''Alagoas'' passing Humait\u00e1, sometime in 1868, presumably after the fortress was captured.

The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bol\u00edvia, Uruguay and Paraguay [[Platine War|forced Brazil to intercede]].  The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 265}}  The Brazilian fleet [[Passage of the Tonelero|succeeded in passing]] through the Argentine line of defence at the Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations.

The navy was further augmented with the acquisition of 20 [[ironclad]]s and six fluvial [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]. At least 9,177 navy personnel fought in the five years' conflict.{{Sfn | Salles | 2003 | p = 38}}  Brazilian naval constructors such as Napole\u00e3o Level, Trajano de Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Brasil planned new concepts for warships that allowed the country's Arsenals to retain their competitiveness with other nations.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 219}} All damage suffered by ships was repaired and various improvements were made to them.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} In 1870, Brazil had 94 modern warships{{Sfn | Schwarcz | 2002 | p = 305}} and had the fifth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 23}}\n\n====Expansion and the end of the Empire (1870\u20131889)====\nDuring the 1870s, the Brazilian Government strengthened the navy as the possibility of a war against Argentina over Paraguay's future became quite real. Thus, it acquired a [[gunboat]] and a corvette in 1873; an ironclad and a monitor in 1874; and immediately afterwards two [[cruiser]]s and another monitor.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 466}}  The improvement of the Armada continued during the 1880s.

The initial spark was provided on 21 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', the twelve-year-old {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, and the new {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''S\u00e3o Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 32\u201338, 50.</ref>\n\nThe ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers\u2014led by [[Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto]]\u2014was the abolition of \"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''b\u00f4lo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By 23 November, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref>Morgan, ''The Revolt of the Lash'', 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nHumiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on 24 November, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] with ten {{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. They planned to attack on the morning of 25 November, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]]. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125\u201323 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on 26 November.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 44\u201346.</ref>\n\nDuring the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well-handled, despite a previous belief {{By whom|date=August 2019}} that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion.\n\n===World Wars (1917\u20131945)===\n====First World War (1917\u20131918)====\n{{Main|Brazil during World War I|U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Navy 1914.PNG|thumb|right|240px|Warship silhouettes of the Brazilian Navy, 1914]]\n[[File:GLAM MB Gibraltar (45024096524).jpg|thumb|left|The Destroyer ''Piau\u00ed'' in the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]].]]\nAfter the declaration of war on the [[Central Powers]] in October 1917 the Brazilian Navy participated in the war.

The Brazilian Navy is the largest navy in [[South America]] and in [[Latin America]], and the second largest navy in the [[Americas]], after the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | title = Oceanographic and Meteorological Data Buoys | newspaper = Hydro International | accessdate = 2009-06-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517001914/http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | archive-date = 2009-05-17 | url-status = live }}.</ref>\n\nThe navy was involved in [[War of Independence of Brazil#Naval action|Brazil's war of independence from Portugal]]. Most of [[Portugal]]'s naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country.  In the initial decades following independence, the country maintained a large naval force and the navy was later involved in the [[Cisplatine War]], the [[List of conflicts in South America|River Plate conflicts]], the [[Paraguayan War]] as well as other sporadic [[List of conflicts in South America|rebellions]] that marked Brazilian history.\n\nBy the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the [[Revolta da Armada|1893 naval rebellion]], there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|two of the most powerful]] and advanced [[dreadnought]]s of the day which sparked a [[South American dreadnought race|dreadnought race with Brazil's South American neighbours]]. The Brazilian Navy participated in both [[Brazil and World War I|World War I]] and [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|World War II]], engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic.\n\nThe modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile [[frigate]]s (FFG), locally built [[corvette]]s (FFL), coastal diesel-electric [[submarine]]s (SSK) and many other river and coastal patrol craft.\n\n==Mission==\nIn addition to the roles of a traditional [[navy]], the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the [[merchant navy]] and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a [[coast guard]]. Other roles include:\n* Conducting national maritime policy\n* Implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragata_Nictheroy.jpg|thumb|left|Frigate ''Nictheroy'' chasing the Portuguese fleet during the war of independence.]]\n[[File:Marquis of tamandare 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|Patron of the Brazilian Navy [[Joaquim Marques Lisboa, Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9]], in 1873.]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Brazilian Navy date back to the [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese naval forces]] based in Brazil. The transfer of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese monarchy]] to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars also resulted in the transfer of a large part of the structure, personnel and ships of the Portuguese Navy. These became the core of the Navy of Brazil.\n\n===Imperial Navy (1822\u20131889)===\n{{Main |Imperial Brazilian Navy}}\n\n====War of Independence====\n{{Main |Independence of Brazil#Independence War}}\n[[File:Treino da armada brasileira 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ships of the Imperial Navy in training, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro, 1870s.]]\nThe Brazilian Navy came into being with the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of the country]]. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portuguese rule had been forbidden to serve, while other members were Portuguese born who adhered to the cause of independence and foreign mercenaries. A number of establishments previously created by King [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]] were incorporated into the navy such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the Supreme Military Council, the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha Moreira]] was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 260}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 53}}\n\nBritish naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane]] was made the commander of the Brazilian Navy and received the rank of \"First Admiral\".{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 58\u201361}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}  At that time, the fleet was composed of one [[ship of the line]], four [[frigate]]s, and smaller ships for a total of 38 [[warship]]s. The Secretary of Treasury [[Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada]] created a national subscription to generate capital in order to increase the size of the fleet. Contributions were sent from all over Brazil. Even [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] acquired a merchant [[brig]] at his own expense (renamed ''Caboclo'') and donated it to the Navy.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 54\u201357}}  The navy fought in the north and also south of Brazil where it had a decisive role in the independence of the country.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}  After the suppression of the [[Confederation of the Equator|revolt in Pernambuco]] in 1824 and prior to the [[Cisplatine War]], the navy increased significantly in size and strength. Starting with 38 ships in 1822, eventually the navy had 96 modern warships of various types with over 690 cannon.\n\n====Cisplatine War and rebellions (1825\u20131849)====\n{{Main|Cisplatine War}}\n[[File:Passage_of_tonelero.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian warships ''Dom Pedro'', ''Dom Pedro II'', ''Dom Afonso'', ''Recife'', ''Dona Francisca'', ''Uni\u00e3o'' and ''Cal\u00edope'' passing through defences at The Tonelero.]]\nThe Navy blocked the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] hindering the contact of the United Provinces (as Argentina was then called) with the Cisplatine rebels who wanted Uruguay to join Argentina again or become an independent country, and the outside world. Several battles had occurred between Brazilian and Argentine ships until the defeat of an Argentine flotilla composed of two [[corvette]]s, five brigs and one [[barquentine]] near the Island of Santiago in 1827. The war came to a draw and in 1828 had to accept the independence of Uruguay. When Pedro I abdicated in 1831, he left a powerful navy made up of two ships of the line and ten [[frigate]]s in addition to corvettes, [[steamship]]s, and other ships for a total of at least 80 warships in peacetime.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 133\u201335}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}\n[[File:Steamship_dom_Afonso.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Artistic representation of the steam corvette Imperial ''Dom Afonso'' in 1850]]\nDuring the 58-year reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] the Brazilian Navy achieved its greatest strength in relation to navies around the world.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 216}}  The Arsenal, Navy department, and the Naval Jail were improved and the Imperial Marine Corps was created. Steam navigation was adopted. Brazil quickly modernized its fleet acquiring ships from foreign sources while also constructing ships locally. Brazil's Navy substituted the old [[smoothbore]] cannon for new ones with rifled barrels, which were more accurate and had longer ranges. Improvements were also made in the Arsenals (shipyards) and naval bases, which were equipped with new workshops.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}  Ships were constructed in the Naval Arsenal of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife, Santos, Niter\u00f3i and Pelotas. The Navy also successfully fought against all revolts that occurred during the Regency where it conducted blockades and transported the Army troops; including Cabanagem, [[Ragamuffin War]], [[Sabinada]], [[Balaiada]], amongst others.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 205\u20136}}\n\nWhen Emperor Pedro II was declared of legal age and assumed his constitutional prerogatives in 1840, the Armada had over 90 warships: six frigates, seven corvettes, two barque-schooners, six brigs, eight brig-schooners, 16 [[gunboat]]s, 12 schooners, seven armed brigantine-schooners, six steam [[barque]]s, three transport ships, two armed [[lugger]]s, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s and thirteen larger [[boat]]s.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 210}}\n\nDuring the 1850s the State Secretary, the Accounting Department of the Navy, the Headquarters of the Navy and the Naval Academy were reorganized and improved. New ships were purchased and the ports administrations were better equipped. The Imperial Mariner Corps was definitively regularized and the Marine Corps was created, taking the place of the Naval Artillery. The Service of Assistance for Invalids was also established, along with several schools for sailors and craftsmen.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | pp  = 207\u20138}}\n\n====Platine & Paraguayan wars (1849\u20131870)====\n{{Main|Paraguayan War}}\n\n[[File:O_Alagoas_passando_Humayta.png|thumb|right|A rare photograph of the Brazilian river monitor ''Alagoas'' passing Humait\u00e1, sometime in 1868, presumably after the fortress was captured.

From a soldier's photographic album preserved at the [[National Library of Brazil]].]]\nThe conflicts in the Platine region did not cease after the war of 1825. The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bol\u00edvia, Uruguay and Paraguay [[Platine War|forced Brazil to intercede]].  The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 265}}  The Brazilian fleet [[Passage of the Tonelero|succeeded in passing]] through the Argentine line of defence at the Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations. The Brazilian Armada had a total of 59 vessels of various types in 1851: 36 armed sailing ships, 10 armed steamships, seven unarmed sailing ships and six sailing transports.{{Sfn | Carvalho | 1975 | p = 181}}\n[[File:Fragata_a_Vapor_Amazonas.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Amazonas'' steam frigate, 1870.

The navy was further augmented with the acquisition of 20 [[ironclad]]s and six fluvial [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]. At least 9,177 navy personnel fought in the five years' conflict.{{Sfn | Salles | 2003 | p = 38}}  Brazilian naval constructors such as Napole\u00e3o Level, Trajano de Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Brasil planned new concepts for warships that allowed the country's Arsenals to retain their competitiveness with other nations.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 219}} All damage suffered by ships was repaired and various improvements were made to them.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} In 1870, Brazil had 94 modern warships{{Sfn | Schwarcz | 2002 | p = 305}} and had the fifth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 23}}\n\n====Expansion and the end of the Empire (1870\u20131889)====\nDuring the 1870s, the Brazilian Government strengthened the navy as the possibility of a war against Argentina over Paraguay's future became quite real. Thus, it acquired a [[gunboat]] and a corvette in 1873; an ironclad and a monitor in 1874; and immediately afterwards two [[cruiser]]s and another monitor.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 466}}  The improvement of the Armada continued during the 1880s. The Arsenals of the Navy in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso continued to build dozens of warships. Also, four torpedo boats were purchased.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}\n[[File:Cruzador Almirante Barroso 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cruiser ''Almirante Barroso'', 1880.]]\n[[File:Encoura\u00e7ado_de_Esquadra_Riachuelo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Riachuelo'' warship.]]\n[[File:Aquidaba_LOC_det_4a04853.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Aquibad\u00e3'' warship.]]\nOn November 30, 1883, the Practical School of Torpedoes was created along with a workshop devoted to constructing and repairing torpedoes and electric devices in the Arsenal of Navy of Rio de Janeiro.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 221}}  This Arsenal constructed four steam gunboats and one schooner, all with iron and steel hulls (the first of these categories constructed in the country).{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}  The Imperial Armada reached its apex with the incorporation of the ironclad [[battleship]]s {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Riachuelo||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidab\u00e3||2}} (both equipped with torpedo launchers) in 1884 and 1885, respectively. Both ships (considered state-of-the-art by experts from Europe) allowed the Brazilian Armada to retain its position as one of the most powerful naval forces.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 221, 227}}  By 1889, the navy had 60 warships{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} and was the fifth or sixth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Calmon | 2002 | p = 265}}\n\nIn the last cabinet of the monarchic regime, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Jos\u00e9 da Costa Azevedo]] (the Baron of Lad\u00e1rio), left the reorganization and modernization of the navy unfinished.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}}  The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace. The Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9 begged Pedro II to allow him to fight back the coup; however, the Emperor refused to allow any bloodshed.{{Sfn | Calmon | 1975 | p = 1603}}  Tamandar\u00e9 would later be imprisoned by order of the dictator [[Floriano Peixoto]] under the accusation of financing the monarchist military in the Federalist Revolution.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 66}}\n\nThe Baron of Lad\u00e1rio remained in contact with the exiled Imperial Family, hoping to restore the monarchy, but ended up ostracized by the republican government. Admiral Saldanha da Gama led the [[Revolta da Armada|Revolt of the Armada]] with the objective of restoring the Empire and allied himself with other monarchists who were fighting in the Federalist Revolution. However, all the attempts at restoration were violently crushed. High-ranking Monarchist officers were imprisoned, banished or executed by firing squad without due process of law and their subordinates also suffered harsh punishments.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 209}}\n\n===Early republic (1889\u20131917)===\n====Naval revolts====\n{{main|Revolta da Armada}}\n[[File:Aquidaban e Villegaignon.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian battleship Aquidab\u00e3]] (left corner) opening fire with the fortress Villegaignon during Armada Revolt, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro.]]\n[[File:Barroso_1896.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian protected cruiser ''Barroso''.]]\nThe military coup that led to the [[Empire of Brazil#Fall|proclamation of the Brazilian Republic]] (1889), accentuated the decline of shipbuilding in the country. For four decades, between 1890 and 1930 no new ships were built in Brazil. The focus of republican governments was to equip the army to fight internal uprisings in the new regime's early years. The Navy was perceived as a threat to the new republican regime, as it had been more loyal to the Monarchy.\n\nThe situation became precarious in just over a decade as the Naval Battalion was reduced to 295 soldiers and Imperial Marines to 1,904 men. The equipment and vessels acquired were considered outdated by Navy officials, who criticized the abandonment of repair shops.  Naval officers participated in two riots, known as [[Revolta da Armada|Naval Riots]]. The second, avowedly monarchist, cost the officers their careers and their lives, without entering the military justice process. The sailors who obeyed orders and took part in the attempt to restore monarchy suffered cruelly.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | ps =.

The initial spark was provided on 21 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', the twelve-year-old {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, and the new {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''S\u00e3o Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 32\u201338, 50.</ref>\n\nThe ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers\u2014led by [[Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto]]\u2014was the abolition of \"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''b\u00f4lo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By 23 November, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref>Morgan, ''The Revolt of the Lash'', 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nHumiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on 24 November, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] with ten {{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. They planned to attack on the morning of 25 November, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]].

In early 1942, German submarines aimed to interdict supplies from reaching Britain and the Soviet Union. Between 1942 and 1944, Brazil's navy was supported by the United States Navy. During this period several naval bases were established in the North and Northeast of Brazil, becoming the headquarters of the Allied Command Atlantic South.\n\nWithin their limitations and with the refitting and reorganization promoted with American resources, the Brazilian Navy participated actively in the fight [[anti-submarine|against U-boats]] in the [[South Atlantic|South]], Central Atlantic and also the [[Caribbean]]. They guarded [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[convoy]]s bound for [[North Africa]] and the Mediterranean. Between 1942 and 1945 the navy was responsible for conducting 574 convoy operations protecting 3,164 merchant ships of various nationalities. Enemy submarines managed to sink only three vessels. According to German documentation the Brazilian Navy made over sixty-six attacks against German submarines.\n\nA total of nine U-boats known German submarines were destroyed along the Brazilian coast.

Local fishermen complained that large boats were coming from France to catch lobster off the state of Pernambuco, so the Brazilian Admiral Arnoldo Toscano ordered two corvettes to sail to the area where the French fishing boats were located. Seeing that the fishermen's claim was justifiable, the captain of the Brazilian vessel then demanded that the French boats retreat to deeper water, leaving the continental shelf to smaller Brazilian vessels. The situation became very tense once the French rejected this demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put fleet in a state of alert.\n\nThe French Government dispatched a {{sclass2-|T 53|destroyer|2}} on 21 February to watch over the French fishing boats.

The dissatisfaction with officialdom and conservative politicians, coupled with the lack of vision and inability of the general policy of then president [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]], led the sailors, encouraged by leaders such as Corporal Anselmo, to the military coup of 1964.\n\nThe purges carried out later (not just the navy but for all the armed forces), and the establishment of certain criteria for selection of its new members were a military term in the Brazilian tradition among its members openly harboring various currents of political thought.\n\nThe {{sclass-|Colossus|aircraft carrier|2}} ''Minas Gerais'' served the Navy until its decommissioning in 2001.\n\nThe carrier was commissioned as NAeL ''Minas Gerais'' (named for Kubitschek's home state) on 6 December 1960.

caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of

revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda

[[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in
