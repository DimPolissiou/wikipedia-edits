The [[President of Argentina]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the President. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent from the Executive and from the Legislature.\n\n==Executive Branch==\n{{see also|Ministries of the Argentine Republic}}\nThe current composition of the Executive Branch includes only the [[Head of State]] and [[President (government title)|President]], formally given the power over the Administration to follow through with the interests of the Nation. The President is also the Chief of the Argentine Armed Forces.\n[[Image:Casa rosada 3.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Casa Rosada]], official residence of the President of Argentina]]''\nThe [[President of Argentina|President]] and the [[List of Vice Presidents of Argentina|Vice President]] are elected through [[universal suffrage]] by the nation considered as a whole. The [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|Constitutional reform of 1994]] introduced a ''two-round system'' by which the winning President-Vice President ticket has to receive '''either''' more than 45% of the overall valid votes, or at least 40% of it '''and''' a 10% lead over the runner-up. In any other case, the two leading tickets get to face a second round whose victor will be decided by a simple majority. This mechanism was not necessary in the [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 election]], when it could have first come into use, nor  in the [[Argentine general election, 1999|1999]] election, nor in the last two presidential elections, occurred in [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011]]. However, it was instrumental in the selection of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] in [[Argentine general election, 2003|2003]].\n\nThe cabinet of ministers is appointed by the president, but is not technically part of the Executive Power{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The vice-president belongs to the legislative branch, since the position also holds the presidency of the Senate.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Ministry\n!Logo\n!Website\n|-\n!

The Congress consists of the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] (72 seats), presided by the Vice-President of the Nation, and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] (257 seats), currently presided by [[Juli\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez]], deputy for [[Buenos Aires province]]. Senators stay in office for six years, and deputies, for four.\n\nEach of the [[Provinces of Argentina|Provinces]] and the [[Buenos Aires|Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]] elect deputies and senators directly. Deputies are representatives of the whole people of the Nation, while Senators represent their districts. Each district elects a number of deputies roughly proportional to their overall population by [[proportional representation]], and three senators: two for the majority, and one for the first minority. Members of both chambers are allowed indefinite re-elections.\n\nEvery two years, each of the 24 electoral districts (the twenty-three Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) elects one half of their lower chamber representatives. Districts with an odd number of Deputies elect one more or one fewer of them on each election. As for the Senators, the twenty-four districts are divided into three groups consisting of eight districts. Every two years all eight districts of one of those groups elect all their three senators, assigning two of them from the party that obtains the majority, and one from the first minority party. Six years later, the same group of districts will hold its next senatorial elections.\n\n===Current situation===\n{{Outdated as of|2011|12|10|2012|topic=current composition of Argentine Congress}}\nFollowing the 9/11 [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|mid-term elections]], half the Chamber of Deputies seats and one third of the seats in the Senate were subjected to the ballot box. The '''[[Front for Victory]]''' (FPV) and other allies of [[Kirchnerism|N\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner]], Argentina's [[progressivism|progressive]] ruling couple, secured '''113''' of 257 seats in the lower house, losing 24 seats and their previous absolute majority (the fractious '''[[Justicialist Party]]''', to which the '''FPV''' formally adheres, continue to enjoy the control of the lower house since 1989{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}). Among [[Justicialist]]s representatives, a further '''17''' seats went to ''anti-Kirchnerites'' (mostly [[conservatives]]), gaining just one seat from the previous situation.  The [[centrist]] [[social democratic]] '''[[Radical Civic Union]]''', Argentina's oldest party, allied itself in various districts with the [[centrist]] '''[[Civic Coalition (Argentina)|Civic Coalition]]''' or with the [[social democratic]] '''[[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]]''', secured '''77''' seats, thus gaining 16. The [[conservative]] '''[[Republican Proposal]]''' secured '''26''' seats, gaining 12 from the previous election.  A further '''24''' seats went to smaller parties, mostly provincially oriented, but also from the [[center-left]] spectrum.<ref name=clarin>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/28/conexiones/inicio_info.html ''Clar\u00edn'': Infograf\u00eda]</ref>\n\nSomething similar took place in the Senate, where the Kirchners' '''[[Front for Victory]]''' secured '''36''' of 72 seats (losing 4), the '''[[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]/[[Civic Coalition (Argentina)|CC]]/[[Socialist Party (Argentina)|PS]]''' grouping secured '''23''' (gaining 7), and the '''[[Justicialist Party]]''' wing opposed to the Kirchners maintained their presence of '''9''' seats.  Smaller, provincial parties were left with '''4''' seats in all (losing 3); [[Justicialists]] (pro or against the current Administration) maintained the control over the Senate they've enjoyed since 1983.<ref name=clarin/>\n\nRiding a wave of approval during a dramatic economic recovery from a 2001-02 crisis, the Kirchners' [[Front for Victory|FPV]] enjoyed increasingly large majorities in Congress, reaching a peak at the [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007 general elections]] (153 Congressmen and 44 Senators). However, soon after, on July 16, 2008, a presidentially sponsored bill to increase Argentina's export taxes on the basis of a sliding scale met with a legislative deadlock, and was ultimately defeated by the tie-breaking \"against\" vote of [[Julio Cobos|Vice President Julio Cobos]]. That controversial law cost the FPV 16 Congressmen and 4 Senators by way of defections.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/07/16/um/m-01716277.htm ''Clar\u00edn'': Crisis pol\u00edtica tras el sorpresivo voto del Vicepresidente Cobos {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nIn 2009 elections, FPV candidates lost in the four most important electoral districts (home to 60% of Argentines), only in the [[Province of Buenos Aires]] by a narrow difference. Considering the overall national vote, FPV obtained only a very narrow victory, becoming the Congress first minority from December 10, 2009, onward.<ref>[http://www.elecciones.gov.ar/paginas/if_top.htm]</ref> This will be reflected in strengthened opposition alliances, notably the center-right [[Republican Proposal|Uni\u00f3n Pro]], the center-left [[Civic Coalition (Argentina)|Civic Coalition]] and the left-wing Proyecto Sur, when elected candidates in both chambers take office on December 11, 2009.\n\n==Judiciary branch==\n[[Image:Palacio de justicia.JPG|thumb|260px|Main building of the Argentine Supreme Court.]]\nThe Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions, and a [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] with nine members (one President, one Vice-President and seven Ministers), appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress. As of December 2015 there are six vacancies, which then President Kirchner stated she did not intend to fill.\n\n* President of the Supreme Court: Dr. [[Carlos Rosenkrantz|Carlos Rosenkrantz]]\n* Vice-President of the Supreme Court: Dra. [[Elena Highton|Elena I. Highton de Nolasco]]\n* Minister of the Court: Dr. [[Juan Carlos Maqueda]]\n\n==Provincial and municipal governments==\n{{Further|Administrative divisions of Argentina}}\n\nArgentina is divided into 23 districts called [[provinces of Argentina|Provinces]] and one [[Autonomous city|autonomous district]], which hosts the national capital, the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]] (which is [[Greater Buenos Aires|conurbated]] into the [[Buenos Aires Province|province of Buenos Aires]]). Each of the provinces has its own constitution, laws, authorities, form of government, etc., though these must first and foremost comply with the [[Constitution of Argentina|national constitution]] and laws.\n\nThe government of each province has three branches. The Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. The Executive branch is led by a [[List of Governors in Argentina|governor]]. The Legislative Branch may be organized as a unicameral or a bicameral system (that is, either one or two chambers or houses).\n\nEach province, except for [[Buenos Aires Province]], is divided into districts called [[departments of Argentina|department]]s (''departamentos''). Departaments are merely administrative divisions; they do not have governing structures or authorities of their own.  They are in turn divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] (cities, towns and villages). Each province has its own naming conventions and government systems for different kinds of municipalities. For example, [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] has ''municipios'' (cities) and ''comunas'' (towns); [[Santa Fe Province]] further distinguishes between first- and second- tier ''municipios''; [[Chaco Province]] refers to every populated center as ''municipios'', in three categories.\n\nThe Province of Buenos Aires has a different system. Its territory is divided into 134 districts called ''[[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]]s'', each of which usually contains several cities and towns.\n\nRegardless of the province, each department/partido has a head town (''cabecera''), often though not necessarily the largest urban center, and in some provinces often named the same as their parent district.\n\nMunicipalities are ruled by mayors, usually called [[Intendant#Argentina|Intendant]] (''intendente'') in the case of cities and towns (the larger categories). A city has a legislative body called the Deliberative Council (''Concejo Deliberante''). The smaller towns have simpler systems, often ruled by commissions presided by a [[communal president]] (''presidente communal'') or a similarly named authority.\n\n[[Buenos Aires]] city, seat of the National Government, was declared an [[autonomous city]] by the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|1994 constitutional reform]]. Its mayor, formerly chosen by the [[President of Argentina|President of the Republic]], is now elected by the people, and receives the title of [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Chief of Government]] (''Jefe de Gobierno''). Other than that, Buenos Aires, as the provinces, has its own Legislative Branch (a unicameral Legislature) and elect [[Chamber of Deputies of Argentina|deputies]] and [[Argentine Senate|senators]] as representatives to the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n*{{in lang|en}} [https://www.state.gov/ U.S. Department of State]\n*{{in lang|es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060222111756/http://www.georgetown.edu/pdba/Constitutions/Argentina/argen94.html Text of the Constitution]\n*{{in lang|es}} [http://www.csjn.gov.ar Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina]\n*{{in lang|es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20101113081118/http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/ Presidency of Argentina]\n\n{{Argentine government}}\n{{Argentina topics}}\n{{South America topic|Government of|title=Governments of South America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government Of Argentina}}\n[[Category:Politics of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Government of Argentina| ]]\n\n[[ast:Gobiernu y pol\u00edtica d'Arxentina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Politics of Argentina}}The '''government of Argentina''',  within the framework of a [[federal system]], is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]].

The [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|Constitutional reform of 1994]] introduced a ''two-round system'' by which the winning President-Vice President ticket has to receive '''either''' more than 45% of the overall valid votes, or at least 40% of it '''and''' a 10% lead over the runner-up. In any other case, the two leading tickets get to face a second round whose victor will be decided by a simple majority. This mechanism was not necessary in the [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 election]], when it could have first come into use, nor  in the [[Argentine general election, 1999|1999]] election, nor in the last two presidential elections, occurred in [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011]]. However, it was instrumental in the selection of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] in [[Argentine general election, 2003|2003]].\n\nThe cabinet of ministers is appointed by the president, but is not technically part of the Executive Power{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law.

Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]], subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\" /> which have come to be accepted as:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n*Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n*[[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n*[[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n*[[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with it an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I.

(2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium utile]]''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> the delay between [[royal assent]] of the 2000 Act and its commencement  was due to the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before feudalism's final abolition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2002|page=287}}</ref> However, on 28 November 2004, feudalism in Scotland ended and its relevance will diminish over time. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Security in Scots Property Law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However the Northern Isles had their own legal system, [[udal law]], and its own system of [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|land ownership]][[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#An Absolute Right of Ownership|,]] unlike the rest of Scotland's feudal system.

The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]], subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\" /> which have come to be accepted as:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n*Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n*[[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n*[[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n*[[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with it an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I.

(2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> the delay between [[royal assent]] of the 2000 Act and its commencement  was due to the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before feudalism's final abolition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2002|page=287}}</ref> However, on 28 November 2004, feudalism in Scotland ended and its relevance will diminish over time. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Security in Scots Property Law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> The [[Registers of Scotland]] ''2012'' ''Registration Manual'' describes the current situation:<blockquote>\"Although the islands are now part of Scotland, udal law has never been formally abolished in Orkney and Shetland.

The name came from Aesop's Fable &ndash; shared with a Korean diplomat over dinner by [[Elizabeth Young, Lady Kennet]] &ndash; and the idea built on the traditional Korean ways of dealing with enemies by giving them gifts to prevent them from causing harm.<ref name=\"ibid.\">Ibid.</ref>\n\nThe policy emerged largely in the context of growing economic gap between the two Koreas, where the South was moving in the path of strengthening its nation powered by the economic prosperity achieved from president [[Park Chung-hee]]'s administration in the 1970s throughout the 1990s while the North was falling into severe economic decline. Facing bankruptcy and spending excessive portion of its funds on warfare along with the nuclear program, North Korea faced widespread starvation among its people during the time.<ref name=\"ibid.\"/> Sunshine Policy was aimed at mitigating this gap in [[economic power]] and restoring lost communication between two nations.\n\nFurthermore, the background to South Korea's decision to engage North Korea through cooperation rather than maintaining a conservative stance in the past hints to a change in the domestic politics as well.

In recognition of Moon's endeavor in inter-Korean relationship as the first president to hold multiple summits in a year, his version of Sunshine Policy became known as \"Moonshine Policy\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe main aim of the policy was to soften North Korea's attitudes towards the South by encouraging interaction and economic assistance.\n\nThe national security policy had three basic principles:\n*No armed provocation by the North will be tolerated\n*The South will not attempt to absorb the North in any way\n*The South actively seeks cooperation and promote reconciliation\n\nThese principles were meant to convey the message that the South does not wish to absorb the North or to undermine its government; its goal was peaceful co-existence rather than regime change. The idea of emphasizing integration rather than absorption is in line with the attempt to refrain from all usage of the term [[reunification]] to be replaced with a more subtle expression during the term of this particular policy. Kim's administration was well aware of the prevalent fear spread within North Korea, afraid of its own identity as a state being taken away through coerced integration or any interaction with the international community.<ref>Levin, Norman D., and Yong-Sup Han. \u201cTHE SUNSHINE POLICY: PRINCIPLES AND MAIN ACTIVITIES.\u201d Sunshine in Korea: The South Korean Debate over Policies Toward North Korea, 1st ed., RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA; Arlington, VA; Pittsburgh, PA, 2002, pp. 23\u201332.</ref>\n\nKim's administration also outlined two other major policy components. The first was the separation of politics and economics. In practice, this meant that the South loosened restrictions on its private sector to invest in North Korea, limiting its own involvement essentially to humanitarian aid. This was initially meant both to improve the North's economy and to induce change in the North's economic policy, though the latter goal was later (at least officially) de-emphasized.\n\nThe second component was the requirement of reciprocity from the North. Initially it was intended that the two States would treat each other as equals, each making concessions and compromises. Perhaps most criticism of the policy stemmed from the significant backpedaling by the South on this principle in the face of unexpected rigidity from the North. It ran into trouble just two months into the Sunshine era, when South Korea requested the creation of a reunion center for divided families in exchange for fertilizer assistance; North Korea denounced this as ''[[horse trading]]'' and cut off talks. A year later the South announced its goal would be \"flexible reciprocity\" based on [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values; as the \"elder brother\" of the relationship the South would provide aid without expecting an immediate reciprocation and without requesting a specific form of reciprocity. The South also announced that it would provide humanitarian assistance without any expectations of concessions in return.\n\nThe logic of the policy was based on the belief that, even in light of its continuing shortages and economic duress, the North's government will not collapse, disintegrate, or reform itself, even if the South were to apply strong pressure. It was believed that military tensions can be lessened through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. This emphasized the normalization of political and economic relations between both the [[United States]] and North Korea as well as [[Japan]].\n\nSunshine policy is often compared to the Western German Chancellor, [[Willy Brandt]]'s Ostpolitik (Eastern Policy) which is a foreign policy of change through d\u00e9tente in the hopes of improving relations with East Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland and other Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe term ''sunshine policy'' originates in ''[[The North Wind and the Sun]]'', one of [[Aesop]]'s fables.\n\n==Kim Dae-jung administration 1998-2003==\nUnder Kim Dae-jung's administration the Sunshine Policy was first formulated and implemented. North-South cooperative business developments began, including a railroad and the [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]], where several thousand South Korean citizens still traveled until 2008, when there was a shooting incident and the trips were cancelled. Though negotiations for them were difficult, three reunions between divided families were held.\n\nIn 2000, Kim Dae-jung and [[Kim Jong-il]] met at a summit meeting, the first conference held between leaders of the two States after the Korean War. The summit meeting was held from June 13 to 15, and at the end of the meeting, [[June 15th North\u2013South Joint Declaration]] was adopted between the two Koreas. In the declaration, the two Koreas reached an agreement on five points, to settle the problem of independent reunification, to promote peaceful reunification, to solve humanitarian problems such as the issue of separated families, to encourage cooperation and exchange in their economy, and to have a dialogue between the North and South. After the summit, however, talks between the two States stalled. Criticism of the policy intensified and Unification Minister [[Lim Dong-won]] lost a no-confidence vote on September 3, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/03/n.skorea.talks/|title=CNN 2001: North and South Korea talks|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324115446/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/03/n.skorea.talks/|archive-date=2006-03-24|df=}}</ref> Returning from his meeting in Washington with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach.

Kang disagrees with claims that the Sunshine Policy has led to a settlement of peace between North and South and questions the concept of no-strings-attached humanitarian aid, saying \"it is important to understand that North Koreans are starving not because of a lack of aid from South Korea or the U.S., but because they are deprived of freedom. Giving aid only throws a line to the government, and prolongs starvation, surely a perverse outcome.\" <ref>{{cite web|last=Kang|first=Chol-Hwan|title=Give Us an 'Eclipse Policy'|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/050Compecon/Korea/050713NoKim.txt|work=Give Us an 'Eclipse Policy'|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the policy built upon \"flexible [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]]\" is often criticized to be an inappropriate ideal, bound to have realistic obstacles in inter-Korea relations. Rather than viewing North Korea as a full equal to its power, South Korea took the stance that the stronger counterpart should wait patiently until the other has gained enough power, allowing North Korea to reciprocate with time. It is theorized that the 'time-differential' in the interaction between the two nations did not aid in the restoration of trust and cooperation but led to further problems in missing transparency and the delay in fully understanding the implications of the policy, which didn't benefit the mass as much as expected.<ref>Levin, Norman D., and Yong-Sup Han. \u201cTHE SUNSHINE POLICY: PRINCIPLES AND MAIN ACTIVITIES.\u201d Sunshine in Korea: The South Korean Debate over Policies Toward North Korea, 1st ed., RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA; Arlington, VA; Pittsburgh, PA, 2002, pp. 23\u201332</ref>\n\nSome critics of the Sunshine Policy contend that rather than increasing the chances of reunification or undermining the regime in North Korea, it has been used instead for political gain in domestic politics in the South.

Even the antagonists of the Sunshine Policy were in agreement that the humanitarian emergency aid that was released from the international community, as well as South Korea, contributed to the relief of North Korea's great famine during the late 1990s. However, the ensuing cooperation policies in fact produced a backlash to goodwill argument stating that the government guided economic assistance and also direct investment instead saved or even brought back the hyper militarized North Korean regime. Which because of this delays the inevitable economic reforms, which in turn consequently stalled the nuclear crisis. This debate now had entered a very decisive combination. The latest supposedly alleged hydrogen bomb test seemed to very much falsify the effectiveness and also the ability to produce the desired result of positive inducement policies based on the Sunshine Policy. The idea was that South Korean economics assistance could succeed in persuading North Korea's post-communist reform and opening, which would hopefully promote peace between North Korea and South Korea. Even with all this effort and good intentions that were put into the Sunshine Policy, the policy itself began to fall apart and would soon be no more. The South Korean government officially acknowledged the reverse effects of both the current and existing inducement approaches. The President of Korea at the time President Park Geun Hye even stated during this time \u201cGone are the days when we caved into the North\u2019s provocations and unconditionally pumped aid into the North\u201d This statement was given as an address to the National Assembly in South Korea. Because of this critical reappraisal, this led to the complete shutdown of the Kaeseong Industrial Complex. The Kaeseong Industrial Complex was the very last symbol of the Sunshine Policy. The building was eventually closed on February 11, 2016.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jin-Ha|title=Rethinking the Sunshine Promise: Structural Impediments to South Korea\u2019s Positive Inducement Policies for the North Korean Problem|date=2016|pages=429\u2013444}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it can be suggested that the Sunshine Policy had some positive effect on North Korea's military and nuclear stance. Kim Suk-young mentions that North Korean government is \u201cboth strong and weak\u201d and it is affected by \u201cexternal and internal pressures\u201d and its decisions to militarize and nuclearize or not are made due to the relationship with other countries. The author of ''Inside the Red Box: North Korea\u2019s Post-Totalitarian Politics'', Patrick McEachern also analyzes that the North Korea's government has not decided its policies Moreover, he stated that North Korea has never changed its behaviors to become peaceful by others' pressures, and suggests it never will. The view that the Sunshine Policy de-escalated tensions is may be given weight by comparing the number of North Korean missile and nuclear tests during Sunshine Policy period and the present unfriendly policy since Lee administration. North Korea engaged in nuclear tests five times and missile tests eight times in the eight years since 2008; by comparison, one nuclear test and three missile tests were carried out before 2008. However, this may also be indicative of the North gaining the technological capabilities to conduct extensive nuclear and missile tests circa 2008. (Refer to [[List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea]], [[List of North Korean missile tests]], [[Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-3]], [[Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-1]].)\n\n==End of the Sunshine Policy: 2008-2017==\nOn October 9, 2006, before the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear]] and [[North Korean missile test, 2006|missile]] tests, South Korea suspended aid shipments to the North and put their military on high alert status.

Its official title is ''The Reconciliation and Cooperation Policy Towards the North'' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\ub300\ubd81\ud654\ud574\ud611\ub825\uc815\ucc45}}), and it is also known as ''The Operational Policy Towards the North'' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\ub300\ubd81\uc6b4\uc601\uc815\ucc45}}) and ''The Embracing Policy'' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\ud3ec\uc6a9\uc815\ucc45}}).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Hyun-Key|title=South Korea's Sunshine Policy, Reciprocity and Nationhood|date=2012|pages=99\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 the [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]], [[Kim Dae-jung]], described a policy that was meant to soften North Korea's attitude towards South Korea, naming it after one of Aesop's fables, '[[The North Wind and the Sun]]'. The name came from Aesop's Fable &ndash; shared with a Korean diplomat over dinner by [[Elizabeth Young, Lady Kennet]] &ndash; and the idea built on the traditional Korean ways of dealing with enemies by giving them gifts to prevent them from causing harm.<ref name=\"ibid.\">Ibid.</ref>\n\nThe policy emerged largely in the context of growing economic gap between the two Koreas, where the South was moving in the path of strengthening its nation powered by the economic prosperity achieved from president [[Park Chung-hee]]'s administration in the 1970s throughout the 1990s while the North was falling into severe economic decline. Facing bankruptcy and spending excessive portion of its funds on warfare along with the nuclear program, North Korea faced widespread starvation among its people during the time.<ref name=\"ibid.\"/> Sunshine Policy was aimed at mitigating this gap in [[economic power]] and restoring lost communication between two nations.\n\nFurthermore, the background to South Korea's decision to engage North Korea through cooperation rather than maintaining a conservative stance in the past hints to a change in the domestic politics as well. According to Son Key-Young, Sunshine Policy emerged ultimately as an evidence of evolving South Korean national identity since the Cold War which \u201cushered in an era of unprecedented confusion in South Korea over whether to define North Korea as friend or foe\u201d (p.&nbsp;4)<ref>South Korean Engagement Policies and North Korea: Identities, Norms and the Sunshine Policy. By SON KEY-YOUNG. New York: Routledge, 2006. 256 pp.</ref>\n\nThe policy resulted in greater political contact between the two States and some historic moments in Inter-Korean relations; the three [[Inter-Korean summit|Korean summit]] meetings in Pyongyang (June 2000, October 2007 and September 2018) and two meetings in Panmunjom (April 2018 and May 2018) as well as several high-profile business ventures, and brief meetings of family members<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-26263952/korean-families-reunited-after-60-years|title=Korean families reunited after 60 years|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34627189|title=Second Korean family reunion in North|date=2015-10-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-20|language=en-GB}}</ref> separated by the [[Korean War]].\n\nIn 2000, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy.\n\nFollowing the election of [[Moon Jae-in]] in 2017, South Korea began reconciling with North Korea once more, thus beginning a revival of the Sunshine Policy. Moon Jae-in's effort in improving inter-Korean relationship resulted in three inter-Korean summits in a year, including two summits held in Panmunjom (April 2018 and May 2018) that marked the first inter-Korean summits to be held outside of Pyongyang, and one in Pyongyang (September 2018). In recognition of Moon's endeavor in inter-Korean relationship as the first president to hold multiple summits in a year, his version of Sunshine Policy became known as \"Moonshine Policy\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe main aim of the policy was to soften North Korea's attitudes towards the South by encouraging interaction and economic assistance.\n\nThe national security policy had three basic principles:\n*No armed provocation by the North will be tolerated\n*The South will not attempt to absorb the North in any way\n*The South actively seeks cooperation and promote reconciliation\n\nThese principles were meant to convey the message that the South does not wish to absorb the North or to undermine its government; its goal was peaceful co-existence rather than regime change. The idea of emphasizing integration rather than absorption is in line with the attempt to refrain from all usage of the term [[reunification]] to be replaced with a more subtle expression during the term of this particular policy. Kim's administration was well aware of the prevalent fear spread within North Korea, afraid of its own identity as a state being taken away through coerced integration or any interaction with the international community.<ref>Levin, Norman D., and Yong-Sup Han. \u201cTHE SUNSHINE POLICY: PRINCIPLES AND MAIN ACTIVITIES.\u201d Sunshine in Korea: The South Korean Debate over Policies Toward North Korea, 1st ed., RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA; Arlington, VA; Pittsburgh, PA, 2002, pp. 23\u201332.</ref>\n\nKim's administration also outlined two other major policy components. The first was the separation of politics and economics. In practice, this meant that the South loosened restrictions on its private sector to invest in North Korea, limiting its own involvement essentially to humanitarian aid. This was initially meant both to improve the North's economy and to induce change in the North's economic policy, though the latter goal was later (at least officially) de-emphasized.\n\nThe second component was the requirement of reciprocity from the North. Initially it was intended that the two States would treat each other as equals, each making concessions and compromises. Perhaps most criticism of the policy stemmed from the significant backpedaling by the South on this principle in the face of unexpected rigidity from the North. It ran into trouble just two months into the Sunshine era, when South Korea requested the creation of a reunion center for divided families in exchange for fertilizer assistance; North Korea denounced this as ''[[horse trading]]'' and cut off talks. A year later the South announced its goal would be \"flexible reciprocity\" based on [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values; as the \"elder brother\" of the relationship the South would provide aid without expecting an immediate reciprocation and without requesting a specific form of reciprocity. The South also announced that it would provide humanitarian assistance without any expectations of concessions in return.\n\nThe logic of the policy was based on the belief that, even in light of its continuing shortages and economic duress, the North's government will not collapse, disintegrate, or reform itself, even if the South were to apply strong pressure. It was believed that military tensions can be lessened through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. This emphasized the normalization of political and economic relations between both the [[United States]] and North Korea as well as [[Japan]].\n\nSunshine policy is often compared to the Western German Chancellor, [[Willy Brandt]]'s Ostpolitik (Eastern Policy) which is a foreign policy of change through d\u00e9tente in the hopes of improving relations with East Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland and other Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe term ''sunshine policy'' originates in ''[[The North Wind and the Sun]]'', one of [[Aesop]]'s fables.\n\n==Kim Dae-jung administration 1998-2003==\nUnder Kim Dae-jung's administration the Sunshine Policy was first formulated and implemented. North-South cooperative business developments began, including a railroad and the [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]], where several thousand South Korean citizens still traveled until 2008, when there was a shooting incident and the trips were cancelled. Though negotiations for them were difficult, three reunions between divided families were held.\n\nIn 2000, Kim Dae-jung and [[Kim Jong-il]] met at a summit meeting, the first conference held between leaders of the two States after the Korean War. The summit meeting was held from June 13 to 15, and at the end of the meeting, [[June 15th North\u2013South Joint Declaration]] was adopted between the two Koreas. In the declaration, the two Koreas reached an agreement on five points, to settle the problem of independent reunification, to promote peaceful reunification, to solve humanitarian problems such as the issue of separated families, to encourage cooperation and exchange in their economy, and to have a dialogue between the North and South. After the summit, however, talks between the two States stalled. Criticism of the policy intensified and Unification Minister [[Lim Dong-won]] lost a no-confidence vote on September 3, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/03/n.skorea.talks/|title=CNN 2001: North and South Korea talks|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324115446/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/03/n.skorea.talks/|archive-date=2006-03-24|df=}}</ref> Returning from his meeting in Washington with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach.

Kang disagrees with claims that the Sunshine Policy has led to a settlement of peace between North and South and questions the concept of no-strings-attached humanitarian aid, saying \"it is important to understand that North Koreans are starving not because of a lack of aid from South Korea or the U.S., but because they are deprived of freedom.

Rather than viewing North Korea as a full equal to its power, South Korea took the stance that the stronger counterpart should wait patiently until the other has gained enough power, allowing North Korea to reciprocate with time. It is theorized that the 'time-differential' in the interaction between the two nations did not aid in the restoration of trust and cooperation but led to further problems in missing transparency and the delay in fully understanding the implications of the policy, which didn't benefit the mass as much as expected.<ref>Levin, Norman D., and Yong-Sup Han. \u201cTHE SUNSHINE POLICY: PRINCIPLES AND MAIN ACTIVITIES.\u201d Sunshine in Korea: The South Korean Debate over Policies Toward North Korea, 1st ed., RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA; Arlington, VA; Pittsburgh, PA, 2002, pp. 23\u201332</ref>\n\nSome critics of the Sunshine Policy contend that rather than increasing the chances of reunification or undermining the regime in North Korea, it has been used instead for political gain in domestic politics in the South.

Even the antagonists of the Sunshine Policy were in agreement that the humanitarian emergency aid that was released from the international community, as well as South Korea, contributed to the relief of North Korea's great famine during the late 1990s. However, the ensuing cooperation policies in fact produced a backlash to goodwill argument stating that the government guided economic assistance and also direct investment instead saved or even brought back the hyper militarized North Korean regime. Which because of this delays the inevitable economic reforms, which in turn consequently stalled the nuclear crisis. This debate now had entered a very decisive combination. The latest supposedly alleged hydrogen bomb test seemed to very much falsify the effectiveness and also the ability to produce the desired result of positive inducement policies based on the Sunshine Policy. The idea was that South Korean economics assistance could succeed in persuading North Korea's post-communist reform and opening, which would hopefully promote peace between North Korea and South Korea. Even with all this effort and good intentions that were put into the Sunshine Policy, the policy itself began to fall apart and would soon be no more. The South Korean government officially acknowledged the reverse effects of both the current and existing inducement approaches. The President of Korea at the time President Park Geun Hye even stated during this time \u201cGone are the days when we caved into the North\u2019s provocations and unconditionally pumped aid into the North\u201d This statement was given as an address to the National Assembly in South Korea. Because of this critical reappraisal, this led to the complete shutdown of the Kaeseong Industrial Complex. The Kaeseong Industrial Complex was the very last symbol of the Sunshine Policy. The building was eventually closed on February 11, 2016.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jin-Ha|title=Rethinking the Sunshine Promise: Structural Impediments to South Korea\u2019s Positive Inducement Policies for the North Korean Problem|date=2016|pages=429\u2013444}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it can be suggested that the Sunshine Policy had some positive effect on North Korea's military and nuclear stance. Kim Suk-young mentions that North Korean government is \u201cboth strong and weak\u201d and it is affected by \u201cexternal and internal pressures\u201d and its decisions to militarize and nuclearize or not are made due to the relationship with other countries. The author of ''Inside the Red Box: North Korea\u2019s Post-Totalitarian Politics'', Patrick McEachern also analyzes that the North Korea's government has not decided its policies Moreover, he stated that North Korea has never changed its behaviors to become peaceful by others' pressures, and suggests it never will. The view that the Sunshine Policy de-escalated tensions is may be given weight by comparing the number of North Korean missile and nuclear tests during Sunshine Policy period and the present unfriendly policy since Lee administration. North Korea engaged in nuclear tests five times and missile tests eight times in the eight years since 2008; by comparison, one nuclear test and three missile tests were carried out before 2008. However, this may also be indicative of the North gaining the technological capabilities to conduct extensive nuclear and missile tests circa 2008. (Refer to [[List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea]], [[List of North Korean missile tests]], [[Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-3]], [[Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-1]].)\n\n==End of the Sunshine Policy: 2008-2017==\nOn October 9, 2006, before the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear]] and [[North Korean missile test, 2006|missile]] tests, South Korea suspended aid shipments to the North and put their military on high alert status.
