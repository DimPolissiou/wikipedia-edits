In addition to its USAF service, which included later service with the [[Air Force Reserve]] and the [[Air National Guard]], it also went on to serve most notably with the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and various air forces in [[Southeast Asia]]. During the War in Vietnam, the C-123 was used to deliver supplies, to evacuate the wounded, and also used to spray [[Agent Orange]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Chase XG-20 glider USAF.jpg|thumb|right|A Chase XG-20 glider, which was later converted to the XC-123A prototype.]]\n[[File:Chase XC-123 Provider prototype c1949.jpg|thumb|right|The XC-123 prototype.]]\n\nThe C-123 Provider was designed originally as an assault [[military glider|glider]] aircraft for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) by [[Chase Aircraft]] as the [[Chase XCG-20|XCG-20]] (Chase designation MS-8 Avitruc)<ref name=\"Gunston p. 170\">Gunston 1980, p. 170.</ref> Two powered variants of the XCG-20 were developed during the early 1950s, as the XC-123 and [[Chase XC-123A|XC-123A]]. The only difference between the two was the type of engines used. The XC-123 used two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800]]-23 air-cooled radial piston engines, while the XC-123A was fitted with four [[General Electric J47]]-GE-11 turbojets, in two pods.<ref name=\"Andrade87\">Andrade 1979, p. 87.</ref> The XC-123A also has the distinction, while only experimental, of being the USAF first jet-powered military transport.<ref>Rolfe, Douglas and Alexis Dawydoff. ''Airplanes Of The World''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1962.</ref> While the piston-powered XC-123 was initially well-regarded for tactical transport for its ruggedness and reliability, and its ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips, the turbojet-powered XC-123A \u2013 designed for high-speed transport between USAF bases for critical parts and personnel \u2013 was found unable to operate from short and rough airstrips. There was also no practical speed advantage due to the wing and fuselage design, and a drastic reduction in range. Only the one turbojet-powered test and evaluation version was built. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBy 1953, [[Henry J. Kaiser]] purchased a majority share in Chase Aircraft, feeling that after having completed [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119]]s for Fairchild under contract, he could take control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser's [[Willow Run]] factory in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser's being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up for bid, and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane]], who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123.<ref>Gunston 1977, p. 164.</ref> Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the ''AVITRUC'' but it never stuck.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%203019.html \"Military transports: Fairchild C-123 Provider.\"] ''Flight'', 5 November 1954, p. 682.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nThe first recipients of C-123 aircraft were USAF transport units, soon followed by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) which used the aircraft for [[search and rescue]] (SAR) missions, and even the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds|U.S. Air Force Demonstration Team, the \"Thunderbirds]],\" used C-123s for a time as a logistics support aircraft for transporting the team's ground crews and equipment. The type would also be widely exported under various U.S. military assistance programs, directly from USAF stocks. A C-123 was used to transport President John F. Kennedy's [[SS-100-X|limousine]] during his November, 1963, Texas tour.\n\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|USAF C-123Bs in the 1950s.]]\n\nThe C-123 was nearly ignored by the USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the [[U.S. Army]] and the Army's use of the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|CV-2 Caribou]] and later pre-production order for the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo|de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo]], led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 to allow it to do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the '''HC-123B''' which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the '''C-123J''' which was fitted with retractable skis for operations in [[Greenland]] and [[Alaska]] on compacted snow runways.\n\n[[File:UC-123B Ranch Hand spraying 1962.jpg|thumb|A [[Operation Ranch Hand|Ranch Hand]] UC-123B over Vietnam in 1962.]]\n[[File:C-123K 19 ACS over Mekong Delta 1969.jpg|thumb|A [[19th Special Operations Squadron|19th ACS]] C-123K over the [[Mekong Delta]], 1969.]]\n\nBy 1962, the '''C-123K''' variant aircraft was evaluated for operations in Southeast Asia and their stellar performance led the Air Force to upgrade 180 of the C-123B aircraft to the new C-123K standard, which featured auxiliary jet pods underneath the wings, and anti-skid brakes. In 1968, the aircraft helped resupply troops in [[Khe Sanh]], [[Vietnam]], during a three-month siege by [[North Vietnam]].<ref name=\"Gunston p. 170\"/>\n\nA number of C-123s were configured as VIP transports, including General [[William Westmoreland]]'s ''White Whale''. The C-123 also gained notoriety for its use in \"[[Operation Ranch Hand]]\" defoliation operations in Vietnam. Oddly enough, the USAF had officially chosen not to procure the '''VC-123C''' VIP transport, opting instead for the [[C-131 Samaritan|Convair VC-131D]].\n\nThe first C-123s to reach South Vietnam were part of the USAF's Special Aerial Spray Flight, as part of Operation '''Ranch Hand''' tasked with defoliating the jungle in order to deny rebels their traditional hiding places.<ref name=\"Gunston p. 171\">Gunston 1980, p. 171.</ref> These aircraft began their operations at the end of 1961. Aircraft fitted with spraying equipment were given the U prefix as a role modifier, with the most common types being the '''UC-123B''' and the '''UC-123K'''. Aircraft configured for this use were the last to see military service, in the control of outbreaks of insect-borne disease. The C-123 was also used as \"jump aircraft\" for U.S. Army Airborne students located at [[Lawson Army Airfield]], [[Fort Benning, Georgia]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This aircraft was used in conjunction with the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] and [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]].\n\nIn 1958, the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] received its first HC-123B, followed by seven more in 1961. Installation of a dome on the nose of the aircraft accommodated a large radar allowing the plane to meet the requirements for search and rescue and long range flight over water.  The Coast Guard manned the aircraft with a crew of five: two officers serving as the pilot and copilot, augmented by an enlisted flight mechanic, an enlisted navigator, and an enlisted loadmaster. The HC-123B's role in the Coast Guard was slowly replaced by the longer-ranged Coast Guard [[HC-130]] aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s as those newer airframes came on line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/history-c-123-its-coast-guard-571698.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729012854/http://voices.yahoo.com/history-c-123-its-coast-guard-571698.html |archive-date=2014-07-29 |df= }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\nWith the end of the [[Vietnam War]], remaining C-123Ks and UC-123Ks were transferred to tactical airlift units of the [[Air Force Reserve]] (AFRES) and the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) that were operationally-gained by [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) before 1975 and [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) after 1975.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140204001303/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=310 \"Fairchild C-123 Provider.\"] National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Known as the Special Spray Flight, these aircraft were used to control insect-borne diseases, with missions to Alaska, South America, and Guam being among the humanitarian missions performed by this Air Force Reserve unit.<ref>[http://www.theaviationzone.com/factsheets/c123.asp \"C-123.\"] ''theaviationzone.com''.

Some airframes were transferred to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for test and evaluation programs while others were transferred to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) for miscellaneous programs. These aircraft were also retired by the end of the 1990s.\n\n===Experimental projects===\n[[File:YC-123E with pantobase landing gear 1955.jpg|right|thumb|YC-123E with pantobase landing gear]]\n\nIn 1954, the '''YC-123D''', formerly the XC-123A prototype, flew in its modified state after being converted by '''Stroukoff Aircraft'''. While the most obvious change from the original XC-123A was the switch of engines (to two {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} Wright Turbo Compound [[Wright R-3350|R3350]]-89A [[radial engine]]s, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed [[Propeller (aircraft)#Feathering|fully feathering]] [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), the YC-123D also had a [[boundary layer control]] system fitted. This system directs air from the engines at high speed over the top of the wing, making the wing act as if the aircraft is flying at a higher airspeed. As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755&nbsp;feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850&nbsp;ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000&nbsp;lb total weight.\n\nIn 1955, Stroukoff, under contract from the USAF, produced a single [[Stroukoff YC-134|YC-123E]], designed to be able to take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's ''Pantobase'' system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear. The skis worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.\n\nIn 1956, the USAF awarded a contract to Fairchild to design an improved version of the C-123 under the designation '''C-136''', but the contract was cancelled before the aircraft was built.<ref>Parsch, Andreas.

In 2010, they announced a project to initially remanufacture old airframes for African customers and, where there was demand, to build new aircraft. The airframes would be fitted with new turboprop [[Allison T56|Rolls-Royce T56]]-A-15 engines, a glass cockpit and other enhancements. The proposed C-123T would have had a 25,000&nbsp;lb payload capability, and a take-off run of just over 1,000&nbsp;ft at 50,000&nbsp;lb MTOW. Possible applications included maritime patrol, search and rescue, and even use as a gunship, while roll-on packages have already been developed for mid-air refueling and agricultural applications.<ref>\"Sturdy Provider for Africa.\" ''Jane's IHS, 2010'' via ''[[Africa Aerospace and Defence]] Exhibition News,'' 21 September 2010.</ref>\n\n===Black Spot and other special military C-123s===\nDuring the Vietnam War, some C-123s were modified for specialized roles. Most of these modifications were on a one- or two-aircraft level. Only the usage of C-123s as \"flare ships\" to illuminate targets for fixed wing [[gunship]]s such as the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] and [[Fairchild AC-119|AC-119G]] were more numerous. These aircraft operating under the call-sign ''Candle'' were flown by the USAF's [[14th Flying Training Wing|14th Special Operations Wing]].\n\n[[File:NC-123K.jpg|thumb|US Air Force NC-123K \"permanent test\" model used over the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. It was outfitted with a forward looking infrared system, [[low light level television]], a laser rangefinder, and cluster bomb dispensers.]]\n\nA single C-123B was tested as a possible replacement for the ''Candle'' aircraft, with its rear loading ramp removed and replaced with a large box with 28 large lights. The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000&nbsp;ft. This aircraft, under the provisional designation '''NC-123B''', was dropped because the lights fixed to the aircraft made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.\n\nThe \"Candle\" aircraft had an extended life when several UC-123Ks were transferred to [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in [[Thailand]]. During that period, it was used as a flare ship as well as a [[forward air control]] (FAC) aircraft. The flare duties were generally used for troops in contact (TIC) while the FAC mission directed [[air strike]]s in [[Laos]] over the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].\n\nAnother NC-123B was used as a radio relay aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh trail, with equipment to read the signals from various sensors on the ground designed to pick up enemy truck activity.\n\nTwo C-123K aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project '''Black Spot'''.<ref name=\"Smith, undated. p.

The operations in Korea met with a certain level of success and as a result the NC/AC-123Ks were transferred to South Vietnam in November 1968. The aircraft operated there until January 1969, when they were redeployed to [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon RTAB]], [[Thailand]]. The two aircraft were then returned to the United States to [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], in May 1969, where a second round of training occurred. Four crews attended a ground school in Greenville, Texas, and returned to Hurlburt where they flew the aircraft for the first time.\n\nThe fate of the aircraft is still unclear. Sources have missions terminating in early July 1970 and the aircraft flying to the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center (MASDC)]] \"boneyard\" at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona, where they were returned to C-123K standard, then returned to South Vietnam still wearing their camouflage and black undersides for transport duty.<ref name=\"Davis p. 50\"/> However, the official history states that combat operations ceased on 11 May 1969, with no mention of the second deployment.<ref name=\"Smith, undated. p.

The five Taiwan C-123Bs were sent to Lockheed Skunk Works for modifications as covert insertion aircraft with \"smart\" air-to-air jammer, BSTR system to jam the radars of ground anti-aircraft guns, also added a defensive operator's station to operate the jammers on board, with extra fuel in underwing tanks, with 36 Taiwanese crew finished training courses at Pope AFB by November 1962.\n\nThe five ROCAF/Taiwan/CIA C-123Bs would be used over North Vietnam as low level and nighttime covert airdrop aircraft, under the South Star II agreement, under the guise of Taiwan's national airline, China Airlines, which had \"cover story\" of operating Vietnamese Air Transport (VIAT) in South Vietnam, that was formerly operated by Air America. The secret outfit was based in Saigon, but would fly out of Da Nang for airdrop missions going into North Vietnam, with some missions lasting 14 hours.\n\nOn 1 February 1964, the overall control of South Star II was transferred from CIA to Studies and Observations Group (SOG), as part of U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) in Saigon. The outfit was redesignated as Det. 1 of USAF's 75th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), but within SOG it was known as the First Flight Detachment (FFD).\n\nIn May 1964, under \"Project Duck Hook\", six more C-123s received extensive modifications by Lockheed Air Service at Ontario, California, equipped with ATIR and BSTR ECM packages, ASN-25 Doppler navigation system, APN-153 terrain-following radar, a console station for radio operator, new HF radio and other radios. These aircraft were issued to the secret Taiwanese Black Bat unit operating in South Vietnam. In October 1964, MACV, CIA and ROCAF/Taiwan signed the South Star III agreement to continue the operation in Vietnam. The six \"Duck Hook\" C-123Bs were based at [[Nha Trang Air Base]], north of Cam Ranh Bay, officially designated as USAF Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron.\n\nThe \"Duck Hook\" C-123Bs were updated with RDR-10 weather radar and ARN-131 homing receiver in 1966 in order to perform missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail. All C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks in 1968, with two wing-mounted turbjets, plus an ECM upgrade with APR-25 radar warning receiver and ALE-1 chaff dispenser. Project \"Duck Hook\" designation was ultimately changed to \"Heavy Hook\". The Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron unit at Nha Trang received an outstanding unit award from the USAF, for flying 4,000 classified combat and combat support missions from June 1966 to May 1968.\n\nIn May 1970, C-123Ks from the \"Black Bats\" supported the secret U.S. military incursion into Cambodia. In October 1970, flights into Laos began. In March 1972, the SOG was deactivated, and the Southern Star operation ended with four surviving C-123Ks returned to Taiwan. On 1 March 1973, 34th \"Black Bat\" Squadron of ROCAF/Taiwan was disbanded.<ref name=\"Pocock\">Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights Over China From Taiwan, 1951\u20131969''.

Carter, filed a complaint with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the [[Air Force Reserve]] at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known [[carcinogen]] [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxin]], studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe aircraft which were flown from 1972\u20131982, were assigned to the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the windows open due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, \"...within official channels.\" Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the [[Robins AFB]], Georgia [[Museum of Aviation (Warner Robins)|Museum of Aviation]] with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.<ref>Philpott, Tom.

On 18 June 2011, the veterans' complaint was accepted with the Department of Defense Inspector General, adding the request that the UC-123K aircraft themselves be designated by the Secretary of Defense as \"Agent Orange Exposure Sites\".<ref>\"DOD IG Complaint #02301.\" ''Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense.''</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs posted two notices of its decision that, while the post-Vietnam aircraft \"may\" have been contaminated, the aircrews were \"unlikely\" to have suffered exposure to dioxin. In an unusual response, the U.S. Center for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry quickly countered the VA position on 25 January 2012 with a statement by their Deputy Director concluding that aircrews and maintenance personnel most likely were exposed well beyond military and government surface-wipe screening levels.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88rlJ4p_859MjhjZGRhZmUtY2JjOS00NzJlLTk2OGItYmNmZmVlOWU2ZmRh/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1 Sinks, Dr. T. (Deputy Director). \"Official letter.\"] ''Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry,'' 26 January 2012.</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine began its own investigation into lingering C-123 contamination. In April 2012, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine released its review of the C-123 Agent Orange exposure issue and reported their researchers were unable to determine the degree of exposure, if any, which aircrews may have had aboard the contaminated aircraft in the period 1972\u20131982. Their report was, in turn, challenged by university-based experts Richard Clapp and Jeannie Stellman, both of whom continue to assert contaminated aircraft exposed the aircrews as well as aerial port and maintenance veterans. As of August 2012, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has denied service-connection (the linking of a veteran's illness to military service) to every application for medical benefits.\n\nIn September 2012, [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bys4vxc0iklcmsb/Murphy%20Hamless%20TCDD%20Quote.jpg Thomas Murphy, Director of VA Compensation Services, wrote that TCDD (the well-known toxic component of Agent Orange)] has not been shown to cause harm to humans in his denial of one veteran's application. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/u0k6kooljebdvg8/Scientists%20%26%20Physicians%20C-123%20VA%20Challenge.pdf On 25 November 2012, a committee of scientists and physicians, chaired by Jeanne Stellman], informed the VA Under Secretary for Benefits Allison Hickey that the VA's scientific conclusions regarding the C-123 situation were ill-founded and called on the VA to involve outside experts in a re-evaluation. In a subsequent telecon, Deputy Chief Consultant Dr. T. Walters informed veterans no C-123 exposure claims would be permitted to be approved, the VA forming a denial basis around redefining the word \"exposure\" to include bioavailability. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/keas8cs7vcvd7bl/Irons%20Dick%20SOT%20Agent%20Orange%202012%20%284%29.pdf, No bioavailability equals no exposure], and thus no exposure claims permitted and indeed, since veterans began learning of the contamination of the C-123 fleet, no exposure claims have been approved other than via appeal to the VA Board of Correction.\n\nVeterans have cited the [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2i9zgfd98ldugke/Federal%20Register.pdf, 8 May 2001 Federal Register, page 23166], and the [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbu59j5t13ijm93/Fed%20Register%2031%20Aug%202010%20page%2053205.pdf 31 August 2010 Federal Register, page 5320] 5, each of which state:carried the VA statement: '\"Finally, we wish to make clear that the presumptions of service connection provided by this rule will apply to any veteran who was exposed during service to the herbicides used in Vietnam, even if exposure occurred outside of Vietnam. A veteran who is not presumed to have been exposed to herbicides, but who is shown by evidence to have been exposed, is eligible for the presumption of service connection for the diseases listed in \u00a7 3.309(e).\"\n\nIn August 2013, the Department of Veteran's Affairs approved the disability claim of Lt. Col. Paul Bailey. This is the first time the VA has recognized a crew member's claim related to Agent Orange exposure while flying planes after the Vietnam War.<ref>Philpott, Tom.

Exposure was confirmed as the single requirement upon veterans to prove for meeting Agent Orange disability claim requirements, and Yale Law detailed the exhaustive list of proofs establishing the veterans' exposure over the decade of post-Vietnam service of the former Agent Orange aircraft. Besides the legal analysis, Yale's purpose was that their finding be useful for all C-123 veterans in submitting disability claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn February 2014, a team of scientists headed by Dr. Jeanne Stellman and including Dr. Peter Lurker, Dr. Fred Berman and Dr. Richard Clapp published a pivotal scientific article in ''Environmental Research'' Titled  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935114000255 Post Vietnam Military Herbicide Exposures in UC-123K Agent Orange Aircraft\"]. The authors challenged both VA and USAF testing methods and earlier conclusions that the C-123K fleet was toxicologically harmless. Their research established that veterans had far greater, and more harmful, exposures than earlier estimated, and that the veterans' TCDD exposures exceeded any published safety standard. The authors noted:<br/>\n<li>Air Force Reserves flew about 34 dioxin-contaminated transport aircraft, 1971\u20131982.<br/></li>\n<li>VA denies benefits, claiming dioxin was bound in \u201cnon-available dried residue\".<br/></li>\n<li>We used limited available sampling data and 3 methods to model dioxin exposure.<br/></li>\n<li>Estimated dermal\u2013oral exposure exceeded US EPA standards for certain personnel.<br/></li>\n<li>Estimated airborne contamination exceeded the only available standard (Germany).<br/></li>\n\nIn response to developing scientific challenges to its position refusing C-123 veterans' exposure claims, on March 10, 2014 VA began revising their web pages to include reference to the submission of a special C-123 study project for the Institute of Medicine. First promised to the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 veterans are brought into the VA health care system.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:C123KProviderCockpitCAM.jpg|thumb|right|Cockpit of a C-123K Provider at the [[Castle Air Museum]]]]\n\n;[[Chase XCG-20]]\n:Two prototype all-metal troop transport gliders built by [[Chase Aircraft]], later designated the XG-20, one became the XC-123, the other the XC-123A.\n;Chase XC-123\n:Former XG-20 fitted with two 2,200 hp R-2800-23 engines.\n;[[Chase XC-123A]]\n:Former XG-20 fitted with four J47-GE-11 turbojets in pairs (of the type used by the [[Convair B-36|B-36]] and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47]]<ref>Gunston 1980 {{Page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref>) under wings.<ref name=\"Andrade87\" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=popular+science+1951+how+your+train+stops&hl=en&ei=k4S-TLmzA5WlngeQ7diJDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Jet Power Troop Transport.\"] ''Popular Science,'' July 1951, photo bottom of p. 81.</ref>\n;C-123B\n:Production model based on the XC-123 with two 2300 hp R-2800-99W engines with accommodation for 61 troops or 50 stretchers, five built by Chase and 302 build by Fairchild Aircraft.\n;UC-123B\n:C-123Bs modified for defoliation and crop destruction duties.\n;VC-123C\n:Executive transport version of the jet-powered XC-123A, not built.\n;Stroukoff YC-123D\n:One aircraft built by Stroukoff with boundary layer control system for improved STOL performance.\n;Stroukoff YC-123E\n:One aircraft built by Stroukoff with modified fin and rudder, modified fuselage bottom (called ''Pantobase'') and pontoon floats to allow operation from water, sand, snow or ice.\n;YC-123H\n:Prototype with wide track undercarriage and two underwing J85 booster engines.\n;C-123J\n:C-123B with two wing tip mounted [[Fairchild J44|Fairchild J44-R-3]] booster engines, 10 converted.\n;C-123K\n:C-123Bs with two underwing J85 booster engines and larger wheels, 183 converted.\n;AC-123K/NC-123K\n:Two C-123Bs converted for armed nighttime surveillance with special sensors.\n;C-123L\n:Proposed [[STOL]] variant with T-64 turboprop engines and a wide-track, large-wheel main landing gear \u2013 not proceeded with.

In addition to its USAF service, which included later service with the [[Air Force Reserve]] and the [[Air National Guard]], it also went on to serve most notably with the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and various air forces in [[Southeast Asia]]. During the War in Vietnam, the C-123 was used to deliver supplies, to evacuate the wounded, and also used to spray [[Agent Orange]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Chase XG-20 glider USAF.jpg|thumb|right|A Chase XG-20 glider, which was later converted to the XC-123A prototype.]]\n[[File:Chase XC-123 Provider prototype c1949.jpg|thumb|right|The XC-123 prototype.]]\n\nThe C-123 Provider was designed originally as an assault [[military glider|glider]] aircraft for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) by [[Chase Aircraft]] as the [[Chase XCG-20|XCG-20]] (Chase designation MS-8 Avitruc)<ref name=\"Gunston p. 170\">Gunston 1980, p. 170.</ref> Two powered variants of the XCG-20 were developed during the early 1950s, as the XC-123 and [[Chase XC-123A|XC-123A]]. The only difference between the two was the type of engines used. The XC-123 used two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800]]-23 air-cooled radial piston engines, while the XC-123A was fitted with four [[General Electric J47]]-GE-11 turbojets, in two pods.<ref name=\"Andrade87\">Andrade 1979, p. 87.</ref> The XC-123A also has the distinction, while only experimental, of being the USAF first jet-powered military transport.<ref>Rolfe, Douglas and Alexis Dawydoff. ''Airplanes Of The World''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1962.</ref> While the piston-powered XC-123 was initially well-regarded for tactical transport for its ruggedness and reliability, and its ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips, the turbojet-powered XC-123A \u2013 designed for high-speed transport between USAF bases for critical parts and personnel \u2013 was found unable to operate from short and rough airstrips. There was also no practical speed advantage due to the wing and fuselage design, and a drastic reduction in range. Only the one turbojet-powered test and evaluation version was built. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBy 1953, [[Henry J. Kaiser]] purchased a majority share in Chase Aircraft, feeling that after having completed [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119]]s for Fairchild under contract, he could take control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser's [[Willow Run]] factory in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser's being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up for bid, and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane]], who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123.<ref>Gunston 1977, p. 164.</ref> Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the ''AVITRUC'' but it never stuck.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%203019.html \"Military transports: Fairchild C-123 Provider.\"] ''Flight'', 5 November 1954, p. 682.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nThe first recipients of C-123 aircraft were USAF transport units, soon followed by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) which used the aircraft for [[search and rescue]] (SAR) missions, and even the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds|U.S. Air Force Demonstration Team, the \"Thunderbirds]],\" used C-123s for a time as a logistics support aircraft for transporting the team's ground crews and equipment. The type would also be widely exported under various U.S. military assistance programs, directly from USAF stocks. A C-123 was used to transport President John F. Kennedy's [[SS-100-X|limousine]] during his November, 1963, Texas tour.\n\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|USAF C-123Bs in the 1950s.]]\n\nThe C-123 was nearly ignored by the USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the [[U.S. Army]] and the Army's use of the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|CV-2 Caribou]] and later pre-production order for the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo|de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo]], led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 to allow it to do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the '''HC-123B''' which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the '''C-123J''' which was fitted with retractable skis for operations in [[Greenland]] and [[Alaska]] on compacted snow runways.\n\n[[File:UC-123B Ranch Hand spraying 1962.jpg|thumb|A [[Operation Ranch Hand|Ranch Hand]] UC-123B over Vietnam in 1962.]]\n[[File:C-123K 19 ACS over Mekong Delta 1969.jpg|thumb|A [[19th Special Operations Squadron|19th ACS]] C-123K over the [[Mekong Delta]], 1969.]]\n\nBy 1962, the '''C-123K''' variant aircraft was evaluated for operations in Southeast Asia and their stellar performance led the Air Force to upgrade 180 of the C-123B aircraft to the new C-123K standard, which featured auxiliary jet pods underneath the wings, and anti-skid brakes. In 1968, the aircraft helped resupply troops in [[Khe Sanh]], [[Vietnam]], during a three-month siege by [[North Vietnam]].<ref name=\"Gunston p. 170\"/>\n\nA number of C-123s were configured as VIP transports, including General [[William Westmoreland]]'s ''White Whale''. The C-123 also gained notoriety for its use in \"[[Operation Ranch Hand]]\" defoliation operations in Vietnam. Oddly enough, the USAF had officially chosen not to procure the '''VC-123C''' VIP transport, opting instead for the [[C-131 Samaritan|Convair VC-131D]].\n\nThe first C-123s to reach South Vietnam were part of the USAF's Special Aerial Spray Flight, as part of Operation '''Ranch Hand''' tasked with defoliating the jungle in order to deny rebels their traditional hiding places.<ref name=\"Gunston p. 171\">Gunston 1980, p. 171.</ref> These aircraft began their operations at the end of 1961. Aircraft fitted with spraying equipment were given the U prefix as a role modifier, with the most common types being the '''UC-123B''' and the '''UC-123K'''. Aircraft configured for this use were the last to see military service, in the control of outbreaks of insect-borne disease. The C-123 was also used as \"jump aircraft\" for U.S. Army Airborne students located at [[Lawson Army Airfield]], [[Fort Benning, Georgia]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This aircraft was used in conjunction with the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] and [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]].\n\nIn 1958, the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] received its first HC-123B, followed by seven more in 1961. Installation of a dome on the nose of the aircraft accommodated a large radar allowing the plane to meet the requirements for search and rescue and long range flight over water.  The Coast Guard manned the aircraft with a crew of five: two officers serving as the pilot and copilot, augmented by an enlisted flight mechanic, an enlisted navigator, and an enlisted loadmaster. The HC-123B's role in the Coast Guard was slowly replaced by the longer-ranged Coast Guard [[HC-130]] aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s as those newer airframes came on line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/history-c-123-its-coast-guard-571698.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729012854/http://voices.yahoo.com/history-c-123-its-coast-guard-571698.html |archive-date=2014-07-29 |df= }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\nWith the end of the [[Vietnam War]], remaining C-123Ks and UC-123Ks were transferred to tactical airlift units of the [[Air Force Reserve]] (AFRES) and the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) that were operationally-gained by [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) before 1975 and [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) after 1975.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140204001303/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=310 \"Fairchild C-123 Provider.\"] National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Known as the Special Spray Flight, these aircraft were used to control insect-borne diseases, with missions to Alaska, South America, and Guam being among the humanitarian missions performed by this Air Force Reserve unit.<ref>[http://www.theaviationzone.com/factsheets/c123.asp \"C-123.\"] ''theaviationzone.com''. Retrieved: 10 August 2010.</ref>\n\nThe final examples of the C-123 in active U.S. military service were retired from the [[Air Force Reserve]] and [[Air National Guard]] in the early 1980s. Some airframes were transferred to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for test and evaluation programs while others were transferred to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) for miscellaneous programs. These aircraft were also retired by the end of the 1990s.\n\n===Experimental projects===\n[[File:YC-123E with pantobase landing gear 1955.jpg|right|thumb|YC-123E with pantobase landing gear]]\n\nIn 1954, the '''YC-123D''', formerly the XC-123A prototype, flew in its modified state after being converted by '''Stroukoff Aircraft'''. While the most obvious change from the original XC-123A was the switch of engines (to two {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} Wright Turbo Compound [[Wright R-3350|R3350]]-89A [[radial engine]]s, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed [[Propeller (aircraft)#Feathering|fully feathering]] [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), the YC-123D also had a [[boundary layer control]] system fitted. This system directs air from the engines at high speed over the top of the wing, making the wing act as if the aircraft is flying at a higher airspeed. As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755&nbsp;feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850&nbsp;ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000&nbsp;lb total weight.\n\nIn 1955, Stroukoff, under contract from the USAF, produced a single [[Stroukoff YC-134|YC-123E]], designed to be able to take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's ''Pantobase'' system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear.

Most of these modifications were on a one- or two-aircraft level. Only the usage of C-123s as \"flare ships\" to illuminate targets for fixed wing [[gunship]]s such as the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] and [[Fairchild AC-119|AC-119G]] were more numerous. These aircraft operating under the call-sign ''Candle'' were flown by the USAF's [[14th Flying Training Wing|14th Special Operations Wing]].\n\n[[File:NC-123K.jpg|thumb|US Air Force NC-123K \"permanent test\" model used over the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].

The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000&nbsp;ft. This aircraft, under the provisional designation '''NC-123B''', was dropped because the lights fixed to the aircraft made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.\n\nThe \"Candle\" aircraft had an extended life when several UC-123Ks were transferred to [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in [[Thailand]]. During that period, it was used as a flare ship as well as a [[forward air control]] (FAC) aircraft. The flare duties were generally used for troops in contact (TIC) while the FAC mission directed [[air strike]]s in [[Laos]] over the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].\n\nAnother NC-123B was used as a radio relay aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh trail, with equipment to read the signals from various sensors on the ground designed to pick up enemy truck activity.\n\nTwo C-123K aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project '''Black Spot'''.<ref name=\"Smith, undated. p.

The operations in Korea met with a certain level of success and as a result the NC/AC-123Ks were transferred to South Vietnam in November 1968. The aircraft operated there until January 1969, when they were redeployed to [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon RTAB]], [[Thailand]]. The two aircraft were then returned to the United States to [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], in May 1969, where a second round of training occurred. Four crews attended a ground school in Greenville, Texas, and returned to Hurlburt where they flew the aircraft for the first time.\n\nThe fate of the aircraft is still unclear.

The five Taiwan C-123Bs were sent to Lockheed Skunk Works for modifications as covert insertion aircraft with \"smart\" air-to-air jammer, BSTR system to jam the radars of ground anti-aircraft guns, also added a defensive operator's station to operate the jammers on board, with extra fuel in underwing tanks, with 36 Taiwanese crew finished training courses at Pope AFB by November 1962.\n\nThe five ROCAF/Taiwan/CIA C-123Bs would be used over North Vietnam as low level and nighttime covert airdrop aircraft, under the South Star II agreement, under the guise of Taiwan's national airline, China Airlines, which had \"cover story\" of operating Vietnamese Air Transport (VIAT) in South Vietnam, that was formerly operated by Air America. The secret outfit was based in Saigon, but would fly out of Da Nang for airdrop missions going into North Vietnam, with some missions lasting 14 hours.\n\nOn 1 February 1964, the overall control of South Star II was transferred from CIA to Studies and Observations Group (SOG), as part of U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) in Saigon. The outfit was redesignated as Det. 1 of USAF's 75th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), but within SOG it was known as the First Flight Detachment (FFD).\n\nIn May 1964, under \"Project Duck Hook\", six more C-123s received extensive modifications by Lockheed Air Service at Ontario, California, equipped with ATIR and BSTR ECM packages, ASN-25 Doppler navigation system, APN-153 terrain-following radar, a console station for radio operator, new HF radio and other radios. These aircraft were issued to the secret Taiwanese Black Bat unit operating in South Vietnam. In October 1964, MACV, CIA and ROCAF/Taiwan signed the South Star III agreement to continue the operation in Vietnam. The six \"Duck Hook\" C-123Bs were based at [[Nha Trang Air Base]], north of Cam Ranh Bay, officially designated as USAF Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron.\n\nThe \"Duck Hook\" C-123Bs were updated with RDR-10 weather radar and ARN-131 homing receiver in 1966 in order to perform missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail. All C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks in 1968, with two wing-mounted turbjets, plus an ECM upgrade with APR-25 radar warning receiver and ALE-1 chaff dispenser. Project \"Duck Hook\" designation was ultimately changed to \"Heavy Hook\". The Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron unit at Nha Trang received an outstanding unit award from the USAF, for flying 4,000 classified combat and combat support missions from June 1966 to May 1968.\n\nIn May 1970, C-123Ks from the \"Black Bats\" supported the secret U.S. military incursion into Cambodia. In October 1970, flights into Laos began. In March 1972, the SOG was deactivated, and the Southern Star operation ended with four surviving C-123Ks returned to Taiwan. On 1 March 1973, 34th \"Black Bat\" Squadron of ROCAF/Taiwan was disbanded.<ref name=\"Pocock\">Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights Over China From Taiwan, 1951\u20131969''.

Carter, filed a complaint with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the [[Air Force Reserve]] at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known [[carcinogen]] [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxin]], studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe aircraft which were flown from 1972\u20131982, were assigned to the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the windows open due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, \"...within official channels.\" Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the [[Robins AFB]], Georgia [[Museum of Aviation (Warner Robins)|Museum of Aviation]] with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.<ref>Philpott, Tom.

On 18 June 2011, the veterans' complaint was accepted with the Department of Defense Inspector General, adding the request that the UC-123K aircraft themselves be designated by the Secretary of Defense as \"Agent Orange Exposure Sites\".<ref>\"DOD IG Complaint #02301.\" ''Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense.''</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs posted two notices of its decision that, while the post-Vietnam aircraft \"may\" have been contaminated, the aircrews were \"unlikely\" to have suffered exposure to dioxin. In an unusual response, the U.S. Center for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry quickly countered the VA position on 25 January 2012 with a statement by their Deputy Director concluding that aircrews and maintenance personnel most likely were exposed well beyond military and government surface-wipe screening levels.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88rlJ4p_859MjhjZGRhZmUtY2JjOS00NzJlLTk2OGItYmNmZmVlOWU2ZmRh/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1 Sinks, Dr. T.

Their report was, in turn, challenged by university-based experts Richard Clapp and Jeannie Stellman, both of whom continue to assert contaminated aircraft exposed the aircrews as well as aerial port and maintenance veterans. As of August 2012, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has denied service-connection (the linking of a veteran's illness to military service) to every application for medical benefits.\n\nIn September 2012, [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bys4vxc0iklcmsb/Murphy%20Hamless%20TCDD%20Quote.jpg Thomas Murphy, Director of VA Compensation Services, wrote that TCDD (the well-known toxic component of Agent Orange)] has not been shown to cause harm to humans in his denial of one veteran's application.

Exposure was confirmed as the single requirement upon veterans to prove for meeting Agent Orange disability claim requirements, and Yale Law detailed the exhaustive list of proofs establishing the veterans' exposure over the decade of post-Vietnam service of the former Agent Orange aircraft. Besides the legal analysis, Yale's purpose was that their finding be useful for all C-123 veterans in submitting disability claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn February 2014, a team of scientists headed by Dr. Jeanne Stellman and including Dr. Peter Lurker, Dr. Fred Berman and Dr. Richard Clapp published a pivotal scientific article in ''Environmental Research'' Titled  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935114000255 Post Vietnam Military Herbicide Exposures in UC-123K Agent Orange Aircraft\"].

First promised to the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 veterans are brought into the VA health care system.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:C123KProviderCockpitCAM.jpg|thumb|right|Cockpit of a C-123K Provider at the [[Castle Air Museum]]]]\n\n;[[Chase XCG-20]]\n:Two prototype all-metal troop transport gliders built by [[Chase Aircraft]], later designated the XG-20, one became the XC-123, the other the XC-123A.\n;Chase XC-123\n:Former XG-20 fitted with two 2,200 hp R-2800-23 engines.\n;[[Chase XC-123A]]\n:Former XG-20 fitted with four J47-GE-11 turbojets in pairs (of the type used by the [[Convair B-36|B-36]] and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47]]<ref>Gunston 1980 {{Page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref>) under wings.<ref name=\"Andrade87\" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=popular+science+1951+how+your+train+stops&hl=en&ei=k4S-TLmzA5WlngeQ7diJDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Jet Power Troop Transport.\"] ''Popular Science,'' July 1951, photo bottom of p. 81.</ref>\n;C-123B\n:Production model based on the XC-123 with two 2300 hp R-2800-99W engines with accommodation for 61 troops or 50 stretchers, five built by Chase and 302 build by Fairchild Aircraft.\n;UC-123B\n:C-123Bs modified for defoliation and crop destruction duties.\n;VC-123C\n:Executive transport version of the jet-powered XC-123A, not built.\n;Stroukoff YC-123D\n:One aircraft built by Stroukoff with boundary layer control system for improved STOL performance.\n;Stroukoff YC-123E\n:One aircraft built by Stroukoff with modified fin and rudder, modified fuselage bottom (called ''Pantobase'') and pontoon floats to allow operation from water, sand, snow or ice.\n;YC-123H\n:Prototype with wide track undercarriage and two underwing J85 booster engines.\n;C-123J\n:C-123B with two wing tip mounted [[Fairchild J44|Fairchild J44-R-3]] booster engines, 10 converted.\n;C-123K\n:C-123Bs with two underwing J85 booster engines and larger wheels, 183 converted.\n;AC-123K/NC-123K\n:Two C-123Bs converted for armed nighttime surveillance with special sensors.\n;C-123L\n:Proposed [[STOL]] variant with T-64 turboprop engines and a wide-track, large-wheel main landing gear \u2013 not proceeded with.

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures. Party meetings and the press criticized monopolistic abuses resulting from irrational decisions at the top and poor implementation of rational policies at the enterprise level.<ref name=\"Units\"/>\n\nAfter a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy.<ref name=\"1980s\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) Bulgaria in the 1980s], Library of Congress</ref> In an effort to remedy the [[shortage economy|chronic distribution problems]] of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels.<ref name=\"NEM\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0116) The New Economic Model], Library of Congress</ref> Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad.<ref name=\"NEM\"/> However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers. The NEM proved to be a failure, and GNP growth between 1981 and 1982 was only 2.9%.<ref name=\"Last round\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0117) Last Round of Zhivkov Reforms], Library of Congress</ref> By 1984 Bulgaria was suffering a serious energy shortage because its [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Soviet-made nuclear power plant]] was undependable and droughts reduced the productivity of hydroelectric plants.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> Bulgaria marked significant progress in scientific research by [[Bulgarian cosmonaut program|sending two men in space]] and supplying 70% of all electronics in the Eastern Bloc,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14354979.html |title=Milliarden Dollar Schulden in Moskau.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Balkanec. 7 Sept.]</ref>\n\n===Political and social===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nAfter Zhivkov fell from the presidency and was expelled from the BCP, the Party gave up its monopoly on power in February 1990 and allowed Bulgaria's first democratic elections for 59 years [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|in June 1990]]. Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 -

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority.

Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Bulgaria improved its diplomatic relations with nations outside the Soviet sphere.<ref name=\"Foreign Policy\"/> The 1970s was a period of closeness between [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's]] USSR and Zhivkov's Bulgaria. Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Balkanec. 7 Sept.]</ref>\n\n===Political and social===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nAfter Zhivkov fell from the presidency and was expelled from the BCP, the Party gave up its monopoly on power in February 1990 and allowed Bulgaria's first democratic elections for 59 years [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|in June 1990]]. Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 - for his contribution to the fight against fascism in the Second World War)\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: Two [[Orders of Lenin]]\n* {{Flag|Portugal}}: Grand Collar of the [[Order of Infante Dom Henrique]] (21 August 1979)\n* {{Flag|Cuba}}: [[Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Todor Zhivkov}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Georgi Traikov]] (as chairman of the National Assembly Presidium)| title = [[List of Presidents of Bulgaria|Chairman of the State Council]]|years=7 July 1971 \u2013 17 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{Succession box|title=[[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] |before=[[Anton Yugov]]|after= [[Stanko Todorov]]|years=19 November 1962 \u2013 7 July 1971}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Vulko Chervenkov]]| title = [[Bulgarian Communist Party|General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party]]|years=4 March 1954 \u2013 10 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{BulgarianPresidents}}\n{{BulgarianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Leaders of the Ruling Parties of the Eastern Bloc}}\n{{Fall of Communism}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zhivkov, Todor}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Pravets]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Communist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Socialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Bulgarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anti-fascists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian atheists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian communists]]\n[[Category:Collaborators with the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Grand Collars of the Order of Prince Henry]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Jos\u00e9 Marti]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Sofia]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian resistance members]]\n[[Category:Communist rulers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Sofia Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Former Bulgarian Orthodox Christians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia]]\n[[Category:Foreign Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heads of regimes who were later imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonality cult:sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov"}

As a \"Samoic Outlier\" language with strong links to western Polynesia, Pukapukan is not closely related to any other languages of the Cook Islands, but does manifest substantial borrowing from some East Polynesian source in antiquity.\n\nRecent research suggests that the languages of Pukapuka, Tokelau and Tuvalu group together as a cluster, and as such had significant influence on several of the Polynesian Outliers, such as Tikopia and Anuta, Pileni, Sikaiana (all in the Solomon Islands) and Takuu (off the coast of Bougainville, PNG). There is also evidence that Pukapuka had prehistoric contact with Micronesia, as there are quite a number of words in Pukapukan that appear to be borrowings from Kiribati (K. & M. Salisbury conference paper, 2013).\n\nPukapukan is also known as \"te leo Wale\" ('the language of Home') in reference to the name of the northern islet where the people live. The atoll population has declined from some 750 in the early 1990s to less than 500 since the cyclone in 2005. Literacy in the Pukapukan language was introduced in the school in the 1980s, resulting in an improvement in the quality of education on the atoll.\n\nThe majority of those speaking the language live in a number of migrant communities in New Zealand and Australia. A bilingual dictionary was started by the school teachers on the island and completed in Auckland within the Pukapukan community there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Briar |title=Pukapuka dictionary goes live |url=http://www.cookislandsnews.com/item/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live |accessdate=3 May 2019 |work=Cook Islands News |date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Te Pukamuna - Pukapuka Dictionary |url=https://pukapuka.world/dictionary |accessdate=3 May 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> An indepth study of the language has resulted in a reference grammar (Mary Salisbury, A Grammar of Pukapukan, University of Auckland, 2003 700pp.).\nThe most significant publication in the Pukapuka language will be the \"Puka Y\u0101\" (Bible), with the New Testament expected to be completed for publishing in 2019.\n\n==History==\nPukapukan, also known as Bukabukan, is the language spoken on the coral atoll of Pukapuka, located in the northern section of the Cook Islands (Beaglehole 1906-1965). Pukapukan shares minor intelligibility with its national language of Cook Islands Maori, and bears strong links to its neighboring Western Polynesian cultures specifically Samoa.\nThe island of Pukapuka is one of the most remote islands in the Cook Islands. There is evidence that humans have inhabited the atoll for about 2000 years, but it is not clear whether it has been continuously inhabited. It may be certain that a final settlement took place around 1300 AD from [[Western Polynesia]]. Local oral tradition records that huge waves generated by a severe cyclone washed over the island and killed most of the inhabitants except for 15\u201317 men, 2 women and an unknown number of children. Recent interpretation of genealogies suggests that this catastrophe occurred about 1700 AD. It was from these survivors that the island was repopulated.\n\nThe island was one of the first of the Cook Islands to be discovered by the Europeans, on Sunday 20 August 1595 by the Spanish Explorer Alvaro Mendana.\n\n===Population===\nThe language of Pukapukan is not only spoken on the island of Pukapuka but on the neighboring Cook Islands as well as New Zealand and Australia. Today the population of Pukapuka has diminished with only a few hundred native speakers. From a 2001 census there were only about 644 speakers on Pukapuka and its plantation island of Nassau. As of a 2011 census, there are now only 450 speakers due to a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Pukapuka in 2005. There are a total of 2,400 speakers worldwide, including those who live on Pukapuka and the 200 speakers on [[Rarotonga]], the most populous island of the Cook Islands.\n\n===Classification===\nPukapukan is an Austronesian language,  (Ethnologue 2013). Though grouped with the Cook Islands the language shows influence from both Eastern and Western Polynesia.\n\n==Sound system==\n\n===Alphabet===\nThere are 15 letters in the Pukapukan alphabet \u2013 five vowels and 10 consonants. The digraph 'ng' occurs in the place that G occupies in the English alphabet.\na, e, ng, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, u, v, w, y\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonant phonemes in Pukapukan are: / p, t, k, v, w, y, m, n, \u014b, l / (Teingoa 1993).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n|[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]]\n|[[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|t]]\n|[[Voiceless velar stop|k]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|[[Voiced bilabial nasal|m]]\n|[[Voiced alveolar nasal|n]]\n|[[Voiced velar nasal|\u014b]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

The semivowel /w/ and the palatalised dental spirant /y/, in general, regularly reflect  *f and *s, respectively.

As a \"Samoic Outlier\" language with strong links to western Polynesia, Pukapukan is not closely related to any other languages of the Cook Islands, but does manifest substantial borrowing from some East Polynesian source in antiquity.\n\nRecent research suggests that the languages of Pukapuka, Tokelau and Tuvalu group together as a cluster, and as such had significant influence on several of the Polynesian Outliers, such as Tikopia and Anuta, Pileni, Sikaiana (all in the Solomon Islands) and Takuu (off the coast of Bougainville, PNG). There is also evidence that Pukapuka had prehistoric contact with Micronesia, as there are quite a number of words in Pukapukan that appear to be borrowings from Kiribati (K. & M. Salisbury conference paper, 2013).\n\nPukapukan is also known as \"te leo Wale\" ('the language of Home') in reference to the name of the northern islet where the people live. The atoll population has declined from some 750 in the early 1990s to less than 500 since the cyclone in 2005. Literacy in the Pukapukan language was introduced in the school in the 1980s, resulting in an improvement in the quality of education on the atoll.\n\nThe majority of those speaking the language live in a number of migrant communities in New Zealand and Australia. A bilingual dictionary was started by the school teachers on the island and completed in Auckland within the Pukapukan community there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Briar |title=Pukapuka dictionary goes live |url=http://www.cookislandsnews.com/item/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live |accessdate=3 May 2019 |work=Cook Islands News |date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Te Pukamuna - Pukapuka Dictionary |url=https://pukapuka.world/dictionary |accessdate=3 May 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> An indepth study of the language has resulted in a reference grammar (Mary Salisbury, A Grammar of Pukapukan, University of Auckland, 2003 700pp.).\nThe most significant publication in the Pukapuka language will be the \"Puka Y\u0101\" (Bible), with the New Testament expected to be completed for publishing in 2019.\n\n==History==\nPukapukan, also known as Bukabukan, is the language spoken on the coral atoll of Pukapuka, located in the northern section of the Cook Islands (Beaglehole 1906-1965). Pukapukan shares minor intelligibility with its national language of Cook Islands Maori, and bears strong links to its neighboring Western Polynesian cultures specifically Samoa.\nThe island of Pukapuka is one of the most remote islands in the Cook Islands. There is evidence that humans have inhabited the atoll for about 2000 years, but it is not clear whether it has been continuously inhabited. It may be certain that a final settlement took place around 1300 AD from [[Western Polynesia]]. Local oral tradition records that huge waves generated by a severe cyclone washed over the island and killed most of the inhabitants except for 15\u201317 men, 2 women and an unknown number of children. Recent interpretation of genealogies suggests that this catastrophe occurred about 1700 AD. It was from these survivors that the island was repopulated.\n\nThe island was one of the first of the Cook Islands to be discovered by the Europeans, on Sunday 20 August 1595 by the Spanish Explorer Alvaro Mendana.\n\n===Population===\nThe language of Pukapukan is not only spoken on the island of Pukapuka but on the neighboring Cook Islands as well as New Zealand and Australia. Today the population of Pukapuka has diminished with only a few hundred native speakers. From a 2001 census there were only about 644 speakers on Pukapuka and its plantation island of Nassau. As of a 2011 census, there are now only 450 speakers due to a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Pukapuka in 2005. There are a total of 2,400 speakers worldwide, including those who live on Pukapuka and the 200 speakers on [[Rarotonga]], the most populous island of the Cook Islands.\n\n===Classification===\nPukapukan is an Austronesian language,  (Ethnologue 2013). Though grouped with the Cook Islands the language shows influence from both Eastern and Western Polynesia.\n\n==Sound system==\n\n===Alphabet===\nThere are 15 letters in the Pukapukan alphabet \u2013 five vowels and 10 consonants. The digraph 'ng' occurs in the place that G occupies in the English alphabet.\na, e, ng, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, u, v, w, y\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonant phonemes in Pukapukan are: / p, t, k, v, w, y, m, n, \u014b, l / (Teingoa 1993).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n|[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]]\n|[[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|t]]\n|[[Voiceless velar stop|k]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|[[Voiced bilabial nasal|m]]\n|[[Voiced alveolar nasal|n]]\n|[[Voiced velar nasal|\u014b]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n!
