The episode follows [[transgender]] character [[Adam Torres (Degrassi: The Next Generation)|Adam Torres]] ([[Jordan Todosey]]) as he struggles with himself and his family over his gender identity. Other plots include [[Anya MacPherson]] and her family learning that Mrs. MacPherson has cancer and [[Dave Turner (Degrassi)|Dave Turner]]'s attempts at improving his grades by being a class clown.

After class he collides with [[Clare Edwards|Clare]] (Aislinn Paul) in the hall, dropping a pack of tampons which, when [[Mark Fitzgerald (Degrassi: The Next Generation)|Fitz]] and [[Owen Milligan|Owen]] notice them, he forces on Clare as if they were hers. The next day Adam [[Coming out|comes out]] as transgender to Clare and [[Eli Goldsworthy|Eli]] (Munro Chambers). Later Adam and Bianca flirt until Bianca discovers that Adam is biologically female and begins spreading the story. Her friends Fitz and Owen assault him in the boys' bathroom. Adam's brother [[Drew Torres|Drew]] (Luke Bilyk) tries to fight them after school but is beaten. Fitz and Owen get suspended and [[Archie \"Snake\" Simpson|Principal Simpson]] (Stefan Brogren) assigns teachers to escort Adam to and from classes.\n\nWhen Drew and Adam's grandmother, who only knows Adam as \"Gracie\", comes for a visit Adam decides to go back to being \"Gracie\" for the sake of family harmony. The stress leads him to [[Self-harm|burn himself]], something that had been a previous pattern. Clare convinces him that he needs to be true to himself. Adam begs his mother for her understanding and support and later he and his family and friends burn Gracie's clothes in a bonfire, symbolically laying her to rest.\n\n[[Anya MacPherson|Anya]] (Samantha Munro) brings some soup home for lunch for her mother, who had complained of a cold. When Anya and her friend, [[Leia Chang|Leia]] (Judy Jiao), discovers her mother has left home without her wedding ring, they suspect her of having an affair. Anya confronts her mother, who explains that she took off her ring for an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. The scan reveals [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. Anya's fear of her mother's death initially leads her to skip a family medical consultation but a talk with former best friend [[Holly J. Sinclair|Holly J.]] (Charlotte Arnold) inspires Anya to go.\n\n[[Dave Turner (Degrassi)|Dave]] (Jahmil French) believes the only way to improve his Media Immersion grade is to make the teacher, [[Winnie Oh|Ms. Oh]] (Cory Lee) laugh. He checks her \"FaceRange\" page and uses her posted pictures for a class project. Failing the assignment leads him to increase his effort to be the class clown until he discovers that Ms. Oh has recently ended a relationship.

(novel)|Washington, D.C.]]\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n'''''The Golden Age''''', a historical novel published in 2000 by [[Gore Vidal]], is the seventh and final novel in his ''[[Narratives of Empire]]'' series.\n\n==Plot introduction==\nThe story begins in 1939 and features many of the characters and events that [[Gore Vidal]] introduced in his earlier novel, ''[[Washington, D.C. (novel)|Washington, D.C.]]'' This includes the families of conservative Democratic Senator James Burden Day, and powerful newspaper publisher Blaise Sanford. The book inserts the character of Caroline Sanford, Blaise's half-sister and publishing partner, who was introduced in the [[prequel]]s to ''Washington, D.C''. It covers America's entry into [[World War II]] and the national politics of that time in some detail, and highlights of the post-war years, and then closes with a year-2000 retrospective.\n\n==Explanation of the novel's title==\nThe title is more ironic than ambivalent, referring principally to hopes expressed by young Americans shortly after winning World War II.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe action centers around President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s maneuvers to get the [[United States]] into [[World War II]] while keeping his 1940 campaign pledge to America voters that \"No sons of yours will ever fight in a foreign war, unless attacked.\" Vidal makes the case that 1) the U.S had backed [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] into a corner with the oil and trade embargo, as well as massive aid to [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]] and unconditional demands Japan could never accept; 2) the U.S. provoked Japan into attacking; and 3) the U.S. had broken Japan's military codes and knew of Japan's pending attack, but intentionally withheld warning [[Pearl Harbor]]. This was to arouse the U.S. populace and [[Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor|bring the United States into the war]], so the U.S could take its place as the post-war dominant superpower.\n\nThe novel gives considerable attention to the rise of [[Wendell L. Willkie]] to become the Republican candidate in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 Presidential Election]], suggesting that Roosevelt's supporters grossly intervened in the affairs of the rival party to make sure that the Interventionist Willkie would win over Isolationist rivals, thus ensuring that whoever won the elections the US would enter the war. The book's detailed depiction of the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] in Philadelphia even suggests\u2014though offering no proof\u2014that [[murder]] was resorted to in order to place a Willkie supporter in a key position of control over the convention's technical arrangements, and that such control was used to sabotage former president [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for a comeback.\n\nAn often repeated theme is the reference to Roosevelt\u2014and afterwards to [[Harry S. Truman]]\u2014as \"Emperor of the World\", to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as \"The Empress\", to the Roosevelt [[White House]] as \"The Imperial Court\", to [[Washington D.C.]] as \"The Imperial City\" and so on. Roosevelt is compared to [[Augustus]], the founder of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nThe novel also covers some of the American artistic and cultural scene after the war, with attention given to [[John La Touche (musician)|John La Touche]], [[Dawn Powell]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and postwar [[Hollywood]].\n\n==Characters==\nHistorical characters:\n* [[William Randolph Hearst]],\n* [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]],\n* [[Eleanor Roosevelt]],\n* [[Harry Hopkins]],\n* [[Wendell L. Willkie]],\n* [[Herbert Hoover]],\n* [[Harry Truman]],\n* [[James O.

(novel)|Washington, D.C.]]'' This includes the families of conservative Democratic Senator James Burden Day, and powerful newspaper publisher Blaise Sanford. The book inserts the character of Caroline Sanford, Blaise's half-sister and publishing partner, who was introduced in the [[prequel]]s to ''Washington, D.C''. It covers America's entry into [[World War II]] and the national politics of that time in some detail, and highlights of the post-war years, and then closes with a year-2000 retrospective.\n\n==Explanation of the novel's title==\nThe title is more ironic than ambivalent, referring principally to hopes expressed by young Americans shortly after winning World War II.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe action centers around President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s maneuvers to get the [[United States]] into [[World War II]] while keeping his 1940 campaign pledge to America voters that \"No sons of yours will ever fight in a foreign war, unless attacked.\" Vidal makes the case that 1) the U.S had backed [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] into a corner with the oil and trade embargo, as well as massive aid to [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]] and unconditional demands Japan could never accept; 2) the U.S. provoked Japan into attacking; and 3) the U.S. had broken Japan's military codes and knew of Japan's pending attack, but intentionally withheld warning [[Pearl Harbor]]. This was to arouse the U.S. populace and [[Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor|bring the United States into the war]], so the U.S could take its place as the post-war dominant superpower.\n\nThe novel gives considerable attention to the rise of [[Wendell L. Willkie]] to become the Republican candidate in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 Presidential Election]], suggesting that Roosevelt's supporters grossly intervened in the affairs of the rival party to make sure that the Interventionist Willkie would win over Isolationist rivals, thus ensuring that whoever won the elections the US would enter the war. The book's detailed depiction of the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] in Philadelphia even suggests\u2014though offering no proof\u2014that [[murder]] was resorted to in order to place a Willkie supporter in a key position of control over the convention's technical arrangements, and that such control was used to sabotage former president [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for a comeback.\n\nAn often repeated theme is the reference to Roosevelt\u2014and afterwards to [[Harry S. Truman]]\u2014as \"Emperor of the World\", to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as \"The Empress\", to the Roosevelt [[White House]] as \"The Imperial Court\", to [[Washington D.C.]] as \"The Imperial City\" and so on. Roosevelt is compared to [[Augustus]], the founder of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nThe novel also covers some of the American artistic and cultural scene after the war, with attention given to [[John La Touche (musician)|John La Touche]], [[Dawn Powell]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and postwar [[Hollywood]].\n\n==Characters==\nHistorical characters:\n* [[William Randolph Hearst]],\n* [[Franklin D.

{"title_page": "List of pasta", "text_new": "{{For|list of dishes prepared using pasta|List of pasta dishes}}\n{{Short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n[[File:Pasta Venice.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|Some different colours and shapes of pasta in a pasta specialty store in Venice]]\n\nThere are many different varieties of [[pasta]].{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xiv}} They are usually sorted by size, being long (''pasta lunga''), short (''pasta corta''), stuffed (''ripiena''), cooked in broth (''pastina''), stretched (''strascinati'') or in dumpling-like form (''gnocchi/gnocchetti''). Yet, due to the variety of shapes and regional variants, \"one man's ''gnocchetto'' can be another's ''strascinato''\".{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xviii}}\n\nSome pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not widely known; many types have different names based on region or language. For example, the cut [[rotelle]] is also called ''ruote'' in Italy and ''wagon wheels'' in the United States. Manufacturers and cooks often invent new shapes of pasta, or may rename preexisting shapes for marketing reasons.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] pasta names often end with the [[Gender (linguistics)|masculine]] [[Number (linguistics)|plural]] [[suffix]]es ''-ini'', ''-elli'', ''-illi'', ''-etti'' or the feminine plurals ''-ine'', ''-elle'' etc., all conveying the sense of \"little\"; or with ''-oni'', ''-one'', meaning \"large\". Other suffixes like ''-otti'' (\"largish\") and ''-acci'' (\"rough\", \"badly made\") may also occur. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.\n\nEach pasta has its own unique purpose. For example, penne and fusilli can hold more sauces than spaghetti due to their hollow shapes. Additionally, the choice of pasta can be used to complement the consistency of sauces used in the cooking process. These choices, however, are mostly due to tradition and habits.{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xiv}}\n\n== Long- and medium-length pasta ==\nLong pasta may be made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] or rolling and cutting.{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px; class=\" |Image\n!Type\n! style=\"width: 12em;\" |Description\n!Translation\n!Synonyms\n!Origin or main area of consumption\n|-\n|\n|[[Barbine]]\n|Thin strands, often coiled into nests\n|Little beards<ref name=\"Cosmo 2017\">{{cite book | last=Cosmo | first=S. | title=The Ultimate Pasta and Noodle Cookbook | publisher=Cider Mill Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-60433-733-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcOZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 | access-date=30 December 2019 | page=85}}</ref>\n|Barbina\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Bavette side.png|120x120px]]\n|[[Bavette (pasta)|Bavette]]\n|Narrower version of tagliatelle\n|Bibs<ref name=\"Kostioukovitch22\" />\n|Baverine, bavettine, lasagneddi (in Sicily){{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|[[Liguria]]{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|-\n|[[File:Bigoli2.jpg|120x120px]]\n|[[Bigoli]]\n|Thick, softer, spaghetti-like pasta.

Yet, due to the variety of shapes and regional variants, \"one man's ''gnocchetto'' can be another's ''strascinato''\".{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xviii}}\n\nSome pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not widely known; many types have different names based on region or language. For example, the cut [[rotelle]] is also called ''ruote'' in Italy and ''wagon wheels'' in the United States. Manufacturers and cooks often invent new shapes of pasta, or may rename preexisting shapes for marketing reasons.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] pasta names often end with the [[Gender (linguistics)|masculine]] [[Number (linguistics)|plural]] [[suffix]]es ''-ini'', ''-elli'', ''-illi'', ''-etti'' or the feminine plurals ''-ine'', ''-elle'' etc., all conveying the sense of \"little\"; or with ''-oni'', ''-one'', meaning \"large\". Other suffixes like ''-otti'' (\"largish\") and ''-acci'' (\"rough\", \"badly made\") may also occur. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.\n\nEach pasta has its own unique purpose. For example, penne and fusilli can hold more sauces than spaghetti due to their hollow shapes. Additionally, the choice of pasta can be used to complement the consistency of sauces used in the cooking process.

The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred \"Muki the Wonder Dog\", named after the authors' own dog\n\n== Fictitious entries in fiction ==\nFictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:\n\n* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, \"The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron\", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.\n* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tl\u00f6n, the setting for much of the country's literature.\n* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry \"Lillian Mountweazel\" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.\n* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[Face the Raven]]\", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.\n\n== Legal action ==\nFictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that \"information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright\", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.\n\n* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/firstnamecourt.htm The \"Philip Columbo\" story]\" ''Ultimate Columbo Site'' (Accessed March 7, 2006)</ref>\n* In ''Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v.

A United States Federal Court found that Nester's selection of addresses involved a sufficient level of creativity to be eligible for copyright and enjoined Hagstrom from copying that portion of the guide. However, the court also found that fictitious entries (in this case, a \"[[trap street]]\") are not themselves protected by copyright.\n* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that \"fictitious names may not be copyrighted\" and \"the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact.\"\n* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for \u00a320,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads.\n\n== Simple errors ==\nOften there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], \"words which have no real existence [...] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors.\"<ref>W.

Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).\n\n== Humorous hoaxes ==\n\n=== Reference publications ===\nFictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as:\n\n* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].\n* ''[[Appletons' Cyclop\u00e6dia of American Biography]]'' (1887\u20131889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.\n* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes' ''Music Lovers' Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because M\u0101ori does not use the letters J, X or Z).\n* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942\u20131973).<ref name=\"mountweazel\" /> Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html \"The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel\"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009.

Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.\n* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches W\u00f6rterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006</ref> The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von B\u00fclow|Loriot]].

Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].\n*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George \"Punch\" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later\u2014well after the pick was made official\u2014admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.\n*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.\n* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:\n**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, and 1957\u201358 seasons.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016\u20132017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Puzzles/games ===\nMany publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:\n*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.\n*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product.

The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred \"Muki the Wonder Dog\", named after the authors' own dog\n\n== Fictitious entries in fiction ==\nFictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:\n\n* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, \"The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron\", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.\n* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tl\u00f6n, the setting for much of the country's literature.\n* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry \"Lillian Mountweazel\" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.\n* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[Face the Raven]]\", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.\n\n== Legal action ==\nFictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that \"information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright\", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.\n\n* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/firstnamecourt.htm The \"Philip Columbo\" story]\" ''Ultimate Columbo Site'' (Accessed March 7, 2006)</ref>\n* In ''Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v.

A United States Federal Court found that Nester's selection of addresses involved a sufficient level of creativity to be eligible for copyright and enjoined Hagstrom from copying that portion of the guide. However, the court also found that fictitious entries (in this case, a \"[[trap street]]\") are not themselves protected by copyright.\n* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that \"fictitious names may not be copyrighted\" and \"the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact.\"\n* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for \u00a320,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads.\n\n== Simple errors ==\nOften there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], \"words which have no real existence [...] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors.\"<ref>W.

Like the previous two books, the book is narrated by [[Natalie Teeger]], Monk's assistant.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Blue Flu strikes===\n[[Adrian Monk]] and [[Natalie Teeger]] are called to the scene of a murder in [[Golden Gate Park]]. A woman has been strangled and her left running shoe taken. Although [[Leland Stottlemeyer|Captain Stottlemeyer]] tries to get Monk to look at the crime scene closer, Monk uses binoculars loaned to him by Officer Kent Milner to learn that this woman comes from the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]]. Stottlemeyer and [[Randy Disher|Lieutenant Disher]] remark that this is the third killing in the park of this nature. Disher argues that they should call the killer the ''Foot Maniac''. But the eventual name of this killer is the ''Golden Gate Strangler''.\n\nAs they leave the scene, Stottlemeyer tells Monk that the city has been planning on making deep cuts in their pay, medical benefits, and pension contributions. Negotiations between the union and the city walked away that morning. He explains that although it's illegal for police officers to strike, there is a strain of the flu going around. Monk initially thinks that it's a disease until Stottlemeyer explains that it's called the Blue Flu, where the police officers call in \"sick\" until they get a better contract.\n\nThe next day, 70% of the detectives' bureau of the [[San Francisco Police Department]] calls in sick. Natalie goes out shopping to buy new clothes for [[Julie Teeger|Julie]], but after a pregnant woman takes a blouse Natalie wanted, Monk exposes the pregnant woman, a man with an oxygen tank, and a nun in the department store as a set of shoplifters. Later, Natalie has a rendezvous with Stottlemeyer in which the Captain explains he is beginning to understand and act a lot like Monk. As they talk, Natalie receives a call. The mayor wants to see her and Monk.\n\n===Monk Gets Reinstated===\nMayor Barry Smitrovich does criticize Monk for the detective's proposal of straightening out [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] (a reference to a scene where Monk is talking to the mayor in the season 5 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike\"). Smitrovich is concerned about the lack of policing out on the streets, and although Natalie states to Smitrovich that Monk won't work for anyone, Smitrovich says that he'll have ''them'' working ''for'' him. He wants Monk to be reinstated to the police department as acting captain of the Homicide division. Although Natalie tries to convince Monk not to accept the mayor's offer, Monk goes ahead and accepts it.\n\nMonk is all too pleased to have his badge back. Natalie does some research behind Monk's new assisting detectives: \"Mad Jack\" Wyatt, Cynthia Chow, and Frank Porter. Wyatt gets his nickname from his violent and unconventional methods on the street and in the department. Chow is a paranoid conspiracy theorist who has spent much of her dangerous life undercover, who thinks that extraterrestrials are trying to impregnate her. Porter is an old veteran detective who took a retirement last year at the clear onset of senility.\n\nOn Monk's first day back in the homicide division, he and Natalie meet Frank Porter and his granddaughter Sparrow. Monk is now being referred to not as Mr. Monk but as '''Captain Monk''', since he is acting captain. Natalie feels an unexpected kinship with Sparrow. Then Monk disappears and is found in the evidence room lamenting how the Golden Gate Strangler, whoever he is, is upsetting Monk's beliefs about the balance of the universe. Monk instructs Porter to immediately double check the dead women's' credit card purchases and to map out the crime scenes.\n\n===Allegra Doucet===\nCurtis informs Monk that there has been a homicide in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district, an astrologer named Allegra Doucet. At the crime scene, Monk and Natalie meet detective #2, Cindy Chow and her psychologist Jasper Perry. Chow's paranoia clearly shows itself when she first is introduced to Monk. Natalie also develops a kinship with Jasper. Monk and Natalie enter the house and find that Allegra is more like a fashion model than an astrologer. Chow explains that someone came into the house last night and stabbed Allegra several times with a [[letter opener]] or [[ice pick]]. Monk goes into the bathroom and finds that someone broke off the towel rack. As he and Natalie leave the crime scene, he can't help but notice a lack of evidence pointing to forced entry. All that is certain is that Allegra knew the killer, judging from the lack of defensive wounds. They go and talk to Madam Frost, Allegra's elderly competitor just across the street. Frost talks like she didn't exactly like Allegra Doucet, and also says that Allegra was a fraud. Monk realizes that Frost has a motive for murdering her neighbor.\n\n====John Yamada====\nMonk then mentions that they are going back to police headquarters, and then asks how they are going to get there. Natalie realizes that her car has been towed, when she receives a call from Officer Curtis about a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]]. Porter also comes on to explain that none of the Strangler women knew each other nor saw each other. Natalie and Monk get in a marked patrol car to race to the new crime scene. When they arrive, most of the people viewing the crime scene are paying attention to the car that crashed into a storefront around the corner. A tall figure walks towards them, whom Natalie identifies as Mad Jack Wyatt. Monk points out that Wyatt shot out two of the tires on the crashed car, causing it to fly into the storefront and catch fire. Wyatt recognized the driver as Trinidad Lopez, a suspect in a string of [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] holdups.\n\nWyatt briefs them on the victim in the street. The man's name is John Yamada, age 44, and he is an architect. While [[jaywalking]] to the market, he was struck by a car and killed. But Monk realizes that this is a premeditated murder and not a hit-and-run when he notices skid marks that indicate the driver to have double parked. Monk points to the dirt around the patrol car that he and Natalie arrived at the scene in, and indicates that it came from a front and a rear point on the car. This means that the dirt came off when the car was in idle. The driver was waiting for Yamada to set foot in the intersection before s/he ran him down. Then Natalie receives another call from Officer Curtis about another murder, causing her to say the city is becoming more unsafe by the minute.\n\n====Diane Truby====\nOn [[Russian Hill]], waitress Diane Truby was walking down the street after getting off the bus when she tumbled in front of the bus. The driver couldn't stop in time and his bus dragged her body down the hill. An alley intersects the street halfway down the hill, and this is where Monk and Natalie meet with Sparrow and Porter. Monk realizes that this is another premeditated murder, and indicates that the kiler sat on the vegetable crate Porter is sitting on and waited for Diane Truby to pass the alley. Then the killer pushed her in front of the bus, and was never seen. He knows that the killer sat on the crate as from there, no one can see you on the street. The killer used the reflection of the mirror utilized by the homeowner so that he could watch for traffic on the street as he backed his car out. Of course, Porter has forgotten who Monk is, and Natalie has to get him back to his senses.\n\nThat night, Natalie is proud of Monk for having his badge back and keeping the SFPD running efficiently even with the number of officers \"suffering\" from the Blue Flu. Monk laments that these are much simpler murders, ones Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher solve every day. Afterwards, they take Julie for a short ride in the patrol car, and also \"imprison\" Julie in the holding cell at the police station. When they arrive, Curtis says that Natalie's Jeep is out in the impound lot, and also informs her that Officer Krupp would appreciate the return of his patrol car. Up in the Homicide Division, Julie is able to identify the brands of each of the shoes the Golden Gate Strangler victims were wearing. She also says that these are obsolete styles, sold out of trucks at freeway off-ramps.\n\n====Convenience Store Robbery====\nCurtis then informs Monk that there's been a robbery at a convenience store and the clerk has been killed. Ramin Touzie is the victim's name. Several black-dressed men had him empty the cash register and then they shot him and ran out back. Monk exposes Lorna Karsch, the night clerk, as the murderer, although when he is telling Karsch that she smells like a toilet bowl, Riglin doesn't appreciate the insult.\n\nThe next morning, Monk instructs his squad and sidekicks that they are going to be reorganizing the squad room accordingly to his liking. Chow informs Monk and Natalie that she has found one person who may have a motive for killing Allegra Doucet. She says that Max Collins, who sells expensive pieces of artwork, lost millions of dollars in bad investments he made based on Allegra's advice. Porter also informs them that he did some digging and found that a customer at the restaurant where Diane Truby worked was stalking her, and this stalker disappeared shortly after her death. Natalie then takes Monk into Captain Stottlemeyer's office, and privately explains that she is concerned that Monk will be working himself to death solving all of these homicides. Later, Monk and Natalie have a secret rendezvous with Stottlemeyer. The Captain is distressed with the fact that Monk has taken over his position. He also states that the two important things in his life were his job and [[List of Monk characters#Karen Stottlemeyer|his wife]].\n\n====Scott Eggers====\nStottlemeyer uses Disher as an example, stating that Disher is a people person, likeable, non-threatening, and courteous. People tell him things that they wouldn't tell anyone else, which is his gift. He also states that Frank Porter, Cindy Chow and Mad Jack Wyatt have gifts that are the flipside of their curses, and tells Monk to save himself for what he does best and leave the rest of the work to the other three. Heading downtown, Monk calls up Porter for information about John Yamada's ex-wife's stolen car and has Chow check up on Diane Truby's stalker. Monk and Natalie meanwhile go to [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] to talk to Max Collins, Allegra Doucet's client.\n\nCollins states that he had heard about Allegra for quite a while, and then, after he lost $3 million, he had a private investigator do some digging, and found that the companies Collins invested in were paying her to steer wealthy clients her way. He tells Monk and Natalie that on the night Allegra was murdered, he was visiting his mother, just around the corner, so he has an alibi that places him in the neighborhood at the time. To Monk, Collins has means, motive, and opportunity to kill Allegra. Then Officer Curtis calls Natalie to inform them that there is one less tax-paying citizen out there. On the way over to the new murder, Natalie happens to drive over the speed limit and gets pulled over and issued a ticket.\n\nAt this crime scene, Scott Eggers has been found dead in the alley behind his house on Tenth Avenue. Monk sees that the killer bludgeoned Eggers while he was on the way to his car, grabbed a grocery bag from the trash, and suffocated him. Eggers was discovered by his lover, Hank Criswell. Criswell tells them to go arrest Merle Smetter, whom Eggers and Criswell ratted out to the city after catching him installing a hot-tub and redwood deck on his roof without a permit. Monk is not convinced that Smetter could have killed Eggers, when he and Natalie spot Officer Milner there. Milner has been trying to work in overtime to support his family, especially when the number of \"sick\" officers has those who remain stretched far and wide across San Francisco. Milner asks if any progress has been made on the Golden Gate Strangler case. Monk states that there has been none.\n\n====The Golden Gate Strangler is discovered====\nMonk and Natalie return to police headquarters to find the squad room rearranged to Monk's rules of order. Chow states that Diane Truby's stalker has bolted. As Monk is about to ask Officer Curtis to find another pencil holder, Bertrum Gruber walks into the station to say he has found the Golden Gate Strangler. Bertrum says he was at the community garden in [[McKinley Park, Sacramento|McKinley Park]] watering his strawberries when he saw a man clutching a shoe to his chest like it was made of gold. The man then got into his 1999 [[Ford Taurus]], which had a broken left rear taillight and a dent on the bumper. Bertrum continues, saying that the last part of the license plate number was M567, like his mother's birthday (May 5, 1967). Monk has Officer Curtis search for any Ford Tauruses with M567 as the last four digits of the license plate number. Monk believes, however, that Bertrum is being partially dishonest about his facts, since it's not a proper time to grow strawberries.\n\nCurtis enters M567 into the computer. There is a hit, which matches a 1999 Ford Taurus with M567 as the last part of the license plate number to a man named Charlie Herrin. Monk, Natalie, Wyatt, and Arnie organize a [[SWAT]] team to raid Herrin's apartment. After Herrin briefly takes Monk hostage and Wyatt discusses planning on shooting him, Herrin gives himself up. Forensic teams find evidence that confirms Charlie Herrin to be the Golden Gate Strangler. Monk believes that Herrin only recently escalated to murder and has been taking peoples' left shoes for some time. Monk explains to Natalie that he believes Bertrum Gruber to be even more dishonest than before, saying that Bertrum remembered the M567 in Herrin's license plate because it reminded him of his mother's birthday. Now if she was born on May 5, 1967, it means she would have been ten years old when Bertrum was born.\n\n====Officer Down====\nBertrum Gruber receives the $250,000 reward for tipping the police in the right direction. After the press conference, Natalie finds that her car's tires have been slashed. After having the tires replaced, she and Monk return to his apartment and find Stottlemeyer there. The Captain advises Monk to keep his profile as low as possible and not to align himself with the commissioner or with the mayor. Leaving Monk, Natalie gets pulled over as her trunk is open. The next morning, Monk and Natalie find Porter to have replaced the Charlie Herrin cases with the other four open murder cases (Allegra Doucet, John Yamada, Diane Truby and Scott Eggers). Natalie finds Jasper telling Sparrow that Herrin was interested in the way the shoes smelled, and not the shoes themselves. They all go over the details one more time, and realize that they have unknowingly been investigating a serial killer. Except for Allegra Doucet, all of the murder victims are 44 years old, and all of them were born on the ''exact same'' date: February 20, 1962. Monk doesn't know who killed Allegra Doucet or why, but he knows why the other three people were killed, and states that they need to take immediate action.\n\nMonk and Natalie return to Allegra's house with Chow and Jasper. They find that Allegra was killed while she was with a client who was in the bathroom. The killer used the astronomical chart in an attempt to track down the witness. Chow offers to analyze the astronomical chart, as Officer Curtis calls Natalie to report a new homicide. But what she hears next is shocking: the murder victim is Officer Kent Milner.\n\nAt the abandoned warehouse where Milner was found next to his cruiser, Monk and Natalie find Stottlemeyer and Disher there. Many of the \"sick\" detectives have returned, if only to investigate the murder of one of their own. The fact that Milner never unholstered his gun indicates he wasn't expecting trouble. Monk believes that Milner either saw something suspicious and came to check it out, or was meeting with a secret informant. Disher mentions having taken the time to sign up for a class taught by Ian Ludlow, the Tolstoy of the Mean Streets. Monk looks at several brochures in Milner's car, and sees that the rookie officer was looking at new homes in Marin County and at Hawaii travel brochures, like he had money to spend. This is ironic, considering that Kent Milner was at the lowest paying rank in the department.\n\n====Solving Allegra's murder====\nSparrow has observed the astronomical chart from Allegra Doucet's house, and states that the person of interest is charming and creative, but also greedy, secretive and really full of himself, since [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is in [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Venus]] is in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. [[Uranus]] is in [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]. so this client likes his freedom and hasn't had much self-discipline. The fact that [[Neptune]] is in [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] means that he is short-tempered and violent. Monk has solved the case, and knows who killed the astrologer.\n\n====Here's What Happened====\nAs Max Collins is leaving Madam Frost's place in his [[Maserati Quattroporte]], Monk and Natalie arrive. Monk explains that they have come to arrest Madam Frost for the murders of Allegra Doucet, John Yamada, Diane Truby and Scott Eggers. The fact that Collins is underestimating Frost is (according to Monk) the fatal mistake Allegra made. After Monk reveals that Allegra was driving clients away from Madam Frost and putting her neighbor out of business, he gives a summation.\n\nAllegra Doucet was with a client on Friday night, when the client excused himself to go to the bathroom. Madam Frost then showed up on some friendly pretense, but Allegra didn't know what was happening until it was too late. Frost stabbed her several times, enough times that Allegra was dead before her body even hit the floor. Then the toilet flushed and Madam Frost realized that there was another person in the house. By the time she got to the bathroom, the client had escaped out the window. This client had seen too much, and Frost needed to silence him or her. She used the astronomical chart to find people in San Francisco born on February 20, 1962, and used this chart to track the witness down. Frost was in a hurry to kill the witness before he could tell the police. All three of the other murders were improvised, and like Allegra, these victims were killed from behind or by surprise.\n\nWhen Monk and Natalie came to talk to Frost on Saturday morning, she was walking up to her house. She had had to park the car she had just used to kill John Yamada on a side street because the police were blocking her driveway. When she killed Diane Truby, she had bought the vegetable crate so she had something to sit on while waiting for her victim to stroll by. Frost also waited in an alleyway for Scott Eggers. She bludgeoned him, then suffocated him with a bag taken out of the trash. Madam Frost confesses to the murders, and is arrested.\n\nOn Tuesday, [[Charles Kroger|Dr. Kroger]] congratulates Adrian for having been reinstated to the force at last. Kroger explains to Natalie how no one asked him about Porter, Chow or Wyatt, whom he had referred to the department earlier. Dr. Kroger states that under normal circumstances they wouldn't be back at the department. Returning to the squad room, Wyatt explains that Porter put together a list of witnesses and they found their murder witness: Tono Busok, who didn't come to the police out of fear that his bootlegging operation would be discovered.\n\n===Kent Milner===\nStottlemeyer and the \"sick\" detectives have found nothing about Kent Milner's death. His arrest sheet shows that he mostly made minor arrests. Monk explains how Bertrum Gruber wasn't being entirely honest about his facts when he gave his tip to the police, and reveals that Bertrum is the person who killed Officer Milner. Monk shows that Milner arrested Bertrum eight months earlier for making an illegal drug buy in [[Potrero Hill]], Milner's jurisdiction. There's no coincidence about how one of Charlie Herrin's victims was disposed of here. Herrin is indeed the Strangler, Monk says, as he reveals that Bertrum Gruber didn't identify Charlie Herrin as the Golden Gate Strangler. Rather, it was Kent Milner who did. But as Milner was a police officer and hence a city employee, he couldn't collect the reward, so he recruited Bertrum to find it on the grounds they would split the money. But Bertrum wanted all of the money, so he killed Milner.\n\nMonk and Natalie go to the jail to question Charlie Herrin. Herrin's left shoe craze is still present, and he takes Natalie's shoe. Monk shows a picture of Officer Milner, and Herrin remembers Milner as the officer who pulled him over for speeding on Saturday. Herrin accidentally had run a red light and clipped another car in the intersection, but they both walked away like nothing happened. He dented his bumper and broke one of his rear taillights. Then Herrin got pulled over for doing 35 MPH in a 25 MPH zone. Herrin was still clutching one of the murder victims' shoes, and he threw it in the back seat just before Officer Milner stepped up to the car. Milner issued Herrin a ticket, but he also saw the shoes and realized that he had just accidentally found the Golden Gate Strangler.\n\nAfter Natalie gets some new shoes to replace the ones Herrin took from her, she calls Bertrum Gruber asking him to meet them at the pier. At the pier, Bertrum gives them the statement he gave to them earlier. Monk reveals that Herrin didn't break his taillight or dent his bumper until ''after'' he left the park, and that Bertrum's mother can't have been born on May 5, 1967. All of the statements Bertrum was giving were in fact the very information that Officer Kent Milner gave him when he agreed to the scheme of taking half of the reward. Stottlemeyer explains that they've got a search warrant and are going to be testing his clothes for [[gunshot residue]] that will match the gun that killed Milner.\n\nBertrum puts a gun to Monk's head, and threatens to shoot, but when Monk vomits on the dock, Bertrum is distracted long enough that he is tackled to the ground and arrested. Mayor Smitrovich is humiliated that he rewarded a cop killer, and he caves in to all of the police union's demands in exchange for a cover up in the press, making it seem like he knew Bertrum was guilty all along and was cooperating with the police in a sting.\n\nMonk feels glad to have been reinstated, when Stottlemeyer tells Monk that his reinstatement is now void. Natalie is furious, but Stottlemeyer says he has no wish of extending the mayor's offer. Natalie tells the other detectives' assistants to keep in touch with each other from time to time. After the speeding ticket from earlier, Monk is able to convince Natalie to go to traffic school.\n\n==List of characters==\n\n===Characters from the television series===\n*'''[[Adrian Monk]]''' - the titular detective, played on the series by [[Tony Shalhoub]]\n*'''[[Natalie Teeger]]''' - Monk's loyal assistant and the narrator of the book, played on the series by [[Traylor Howard]]\n*'''Captain [[Leland Stottlemeyer]]''' - Captain of the Homicide Division, Monk's oldest friend and former partner, played on the series by [[Ted Levine]]\n*'''Lieutenant [[Randy Disher]]''' - Stottlemeyer's right-hand man, played on the series by [[Jason Gray-Stanford]]\n*'''Dr. [[Charles Kroger]]''' - Monk's [[psychiatrist]], played on the series by [[Stanley Kamel]]\n*'''[[Julie Teeger]]''' - Natalie's teenaged daughter, played on the series by [[Emmy Clarke]]\n\n===Original characters===\n*'''Officer Susan Curtis''' - A female officer in charge of clerical duties in the Homicide division.\n*'''\"Mad\" Jack Wyatt''' - A veteran detective who was kicked off of the force after the city lost several lawsuits from his violent and unconventional methods.\n*'''Cynthia \"Cindy\" Chow''' - A [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenic]] who believes that everything is a conspiracy theory.

This is the last time Tony Shalhoub's wife makes an appearance on the show.\n\n===Plot synopsis===\n[[Leland Stottlemeyer|Captain Stottlemeyer]] calls [[Adrian Monk]] to his office for some important news. Monk assumes the worst, but the news is actually positive. After twelve years, Monk's wish of being reinstated to the police force has been fulfilled.\n\nMonk is nervous and excited for his first day back. As [[Natalie Teeger|Natalie]] sends Monk off to work, she reveals that she has an interview for a glamorous job with a concert promoter. As Monk and Natalie say goodbye, Monk laments that this could be the end of their partnership.\n\nAt police headquarters, Monk receives a warm welcome from his fellow officers. Stottlemeyer has even arranged for Monk to sit at the same desk he used years before. Monk is disappointed to learn, however, that he's been relegated to desk duty in the case of the [[Pickaxe|Pick Axe]] Killer, the department's hottest case. Later that day, Officer Russell DiMarco, a colleague of Monk's, bursts into the office announcing that the Pick Axe Killer has been arrested. A [[window washer]] named Mikhail \"Manny\" Almonov saw someone matching the killer's description and tipped off the police. It's great news, but Monk is a little disappointed that the case was solved without his help.\n\nA week later, Natalie is enjoying her exciting new job in the music business, and Monk has left his desk job to begin working with a new partner, Detective Doyle. Monk has suspicions about Manny Almonov's story, so he takes a break from his work with Doyle to investigate the location where Manny claimed that he had \"spotted\" the Pick Axe Killer. Monk quickly establishes that it would have been impossible for Manny to see the killer from that vantage point. Although Monk shares this information with his superiors, no one wants to entertain any theories that might interfere with the successful closure of a highly publicized case, especially since the man who was arrested on the window washer's tip confessed to being the Pick Axe Killer.\n\nThat night, Officer DiMarco is on his way home and meets with Manny Almonov. After DiMarco receives his payoff, Manny shoots him dead.\n\nThe police believe that Russell DiMarco saw something going down on his way home, tried to intervene, and was killed. But Monk suspects that DiMarco may have been murdered while receiving some kind of illegal [[Bribery|payoff]]. Monk's theory makes him a pariah, as cops are supposed to protect the reputations of their brethren. If Monk has any hope of surviving in his new job, he needs to back up his accusations against Officer DiMarco. When Monk comes across Officer DiMarco's ticket book, he finds the evidence he needs to prove his theory and arrest Manny Almanov for the murder.\n\n====Here's What Happened====\nMonk finds Manny standing on a scaffold, preparing to work on a window-washing job. Monk explains what happened. Manny didn't spot the Pick Axe Killer - Officer DiMarco did. Monk figured this out when he found DiMarco's ticket book and noticed that he had written but never submitted a [[parking ticket]] for the killer's car. DiMarco had found the Pick Axe Killer, but as a police officer, he couldn't collect the reward. He wanted the reward, and recruited an old friend of his, Manny Almonov, to identify the killer. Manny made up a story, and took credit for the tip. They agreed to split the reward money later, but Manny got greedy and decided to kill DiMarco instead.\n\nMonk has solved the case, but now he's got a major problem. Manny has knocked out Monk and put him on the [[scaffold]]. Manny raises the scaffold and tries to push Monk off. Monk struggles with Manny as his fellow police officers watch from below. Monk wins the struggle and lowers the scaffold back to street level, where his coworkers are waiting. It's clear that Monk was right all along, and Manny is taken into custody.\n\nDespite having solved a murder during his short time back with the police, Monk decides to relinquish his badge. Natalie, who's missed the excitement of working with Monk, agrees to return to her job as his assistant. Monk is disappointed that his return to the force didn't last, but now he knows that he doesn't need a badge to be happy. He can go forward to find contentment in his life with Natalie by his side, solving crimes on his own unique terms.\n\n{{Monk (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mr. Monk And The Blue Flu}}\n[[Category:2007 American novels]]\n[[Category:2009 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Monk (novel series)]]\n[[Category:Monk (TV series) episodes]]\n[[Category:Novels set in San Francisco]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book  | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = Blueflu cover.jpg<!-- First edition cover preferred -->\n| caption = 1st edition 2007 paperback cover\n| author        = [[Lee Goldberg]]\n| cover_artist  =\n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = [[Monk (TV series)|Monk]] mystery novel series\n| subject       =\n| genre         = [[Mystery novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Signet Books]]\n| release_date  = January 2, 2007\n| media_type    = Print (Paperback)\n| pages         = 304 pp\n| isbn          = 0-451-22013-7\n| congress= CPB Box no. 2704 vol. 4\n| oclc= 77178816\n| preceded_by   = [[Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii]]<!-- Preceding novel in series -->\n| followed_by   = [[Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants]]<!-- Following novel in series -->\n}}\n\n'''''Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu''''' is the third novel by writer [[Lee Goldberg]] based on the television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''. Like the previous two books, the book is narrated by [[Natalie Teeger]], Monk's assistant.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Blue Flu strikes===\n[[Adrian Monk]] and [[Natalie Teeger]] are called to the scene of a murder in [[Golden Gate Park]]. A woman has been strangled and her left running shoe taken. Although [[Leland Stottlemeyer|Captain Stottlemeyer]] tries to get Monk to look at the crime scene closer, Monk uses binoculars loaned to him by Officer Kent Milner to learn that this woman comes from the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]]. Stottlemeyer and [[Randy Disher|Lieutenant Disher]] remark that this is the third killing in the park of this nature. Disher argues that they should call the killer the ''Foot Maniac''. But the eventual name of this killer is the ''Golden Gate Strangler''.\n\nAs they leave the scene, Stottlemeyer tells Monk that the city has been planning on making deep cuts in their pay, medical benefits, and pension contributions. Negotiations between the union and the city walked away that morning. He explains that although it's illegal for police officers to strike, there is a strain of the flu going around. Monk initially thinks that it's a disease until Stottlemeyer explains that it's called the Blue Flu, where the police officers call in \"sick\" until they get a better contract.\n\nThe next day, 70% of the detectives' bureau of the [[San Francisco Police Department]] calls in sick. Natalie goes out shopping to buy new clothes for [[Julie Teeger|Julie]], but after a pregnant woman takes a blouse Natalie wanted, Monk exposes the pregnant woman, a man with an oxygen tank, and a nun in the department store as a set of shoplifters. Later, Natalie has a rendezvous with Stottlemeyer in which the Captain explains he is beginning to understand and act a lot like Monk. As they talk, Natalie receives a call. The mayor wants to see her and Monk.\n\n===Monk Gets Reinstated===\nMayor Barry Smitrovich does criticize Monk for the detective's proposal of straightening out [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] (a reference to a scene where Monk is talking to the mayor in the season 5 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike\"). Smitrovich is concerned about the lack of policing out on the streets, and although Natalie states to Smitrovich that Monk won't work for anyone, Smitrovich says that he'll have ''them'' working ''for'' him. He wants Monk to be reinstated to the police department as acting captain of the Homicide division. Although Natalie tries to convince Monk not to accept the mayor's offer, Monk goes ahead and accepts it.\n\nMonk is all too pleased to have his badge back. Natalie does some research behind Monk's new assisting detectives: \"Mad Jack\" Wyatt, Cynthia Chow, and Frank Porter. Wyatt gets his nickname from his violent and unconventional methods on the street and in the department. Chow is a paranoid conspiracy theorist who has spent much of her dangerous life undercover, who thinks that extraterrestrials are trying to impregnate her. Porter is an old veteran detective who took a retirement last year at the clear onset of senility.\n\nOn Monk's first day back in the homicide division, he and Natalie meet Frank Porter and his granddaughter Sparrow. Monk is now being referred to not as Mr. Monk but as '''Captain Monk''', since he is acting captain. Natalie feels an unexpected kinship with Sparrow. Then Monk disappears and is found in the evidence room lamenting how the Golden Gate Strangler, whoever he is, is upsetting Monk's beliefs about the balance of the universe. Monk instructs Porter to immediately double check the dead women's' credit card purchases and to map out the crime scenes.\n\n===Allegra Doucet===\nCurtis informs Monk that there has been a homicide in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district, an astrologer named Allegra Doucet. At the crime scene, Monk and Natalie meet detective #2, Cindy Chow and her psychologist Jasper Perry. Chow's paranoia clearly shows itself when she first is introduced to Monk. Natalie also develops a kinship with Jasper. Monk and Natalie enter the house and find that Allegra is more like a fashion model than an astrologer. Chow explains that someone came into the house last night and stabbed Allegra several times with a [[letter opener]] or [[ice pick]]. Monk goes into the bathroom and finds that someone broke off the towel rack. As he and Natalie leave the crime scene, he can't help but notice a lack of evidence pointing to forced entry. All that is certain is that Allegra knew the killer, judging from the lack of defensive wounds. They go and talk to Madam Frost, Allegra's elderly competitor just across the street. Frost talks like she didn't exactly like Allegra Doucet, and also says that Allegra was a fraud. Monk realizes that Frost has a motive for murdering her neighbor.\n\n====John Yamada====\nMonk then mentions that they are going back to police headquarters, and then asks how they are going to get there. Natalie realizes that her car has been towed, when she receives a call from Officer Curtis about a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]]. Porter also comes on to explain that none of the Strangler women knew each other nor saw each other. Natalie and Monk get in a marked patrol car to race to the new crime scene. When they arrive, most of the people viewing the crime scene are paying attention to the car that crashed into a storefront around the corner. A tall figure walks towards them, whom Natalie identifies as Mad Jack Wyatt. Monk points out that Wyatt shot out two of the tires on the crashed car, causing it to fly into the storefront and catch fire. Wyatt recognized the driver as Trinidad Lopez, a suspect in a string of [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] holdups.\n\nWyatt briefs them on the victim in the street. The man's name is John Yamada, age 44, and he is an architect. While [[jaywalking]] to the market, he was struck by a car and killed. But Monk realizes that this is a premeditated murder and not a hit-and-run when he notices skid marks that indicate the driver to have double parked. Monk points to the dirt around the patrol car that he and Natalie arrived at the scene in, and indicates that it came from a front and a rear point on the car. This means that the dirt came off when the car was in idle. The driver was waiting for Yamada to set foot in the intersection before s/he ran him down. Then Natalie receives another call from Officer Curtis about another murder, causing her to say the city is becoming more unsafe by the minute.\n\n====Diane Truby====\nOn [[Russian Hill]], waitress Diane Truby was walking down the street after getting off the bus when she tumbled in front of the bus. The driver couldn't stop in time and his bus dragged her body down the hill. An alley intersects the street halfway down the hill, and this is where Monk and Natalie meet with Sparrow and Porter. Monk realizes that this is another premeditated murder, and indicates that the kiler sat on the vegetable crate Porter is sitting on and waited for Diane Truby to pass the alley. Then the killer pushed her in front of the bus, and was never seen. He knows that the killer sat on the crate as from there, no one can see you on the street. The killer used the reflection of the mirror utilized by the homeowner so that he could watch for traffic on the street as he backed his car out. Of course, Porter has forgotten who Monk is, and Natalie has to get him back to his senses.\n\nThat night, Natalie is proud of Monk for having his badge back and keeping the SFPD running efficiently even with the number of officers \"suffering\" from the Blue Flu. Monk laments that these are much simpler murders, ones Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher solve every day. Afterwards, they take Julie for a short ride in the patrol car, and also \"imprison\" Julie in the holding cell at the police station. When they arrive, Curtis says that Natalie's Jeep is out in the impound lot, and also informs her that Officer Krupp would appreciate the return of his patrol car. Up in the Homicide Division, Julie is able to identify the brands of each of the shoes the Golden Gate Strangler victims were wearing. She also says that these are obsolete styles, sold out of trucks at freeway off-ramps.\n\n====Convenience Store Robbery====\nCurtis then informs Monk that there's been a robbery at a convenience store and the clerk has been killed. Ramin Touzie is the victim's name. Several black-dressed men had him empty the cash register and then they shot him and ran out back. Monk exposes Lorna Karsch, the night clerk, as the murderer, although when he is telling Karsch that she smells like a toilet bowl, Riglin doesn't appreciate the insult.\n\nThe next morning, Monk instructs his squad and sidekicks that they are going to be reorganizing the squad room accordingly to his liking. Chow informs Monk and Natalie that she has found one person who may have a motive for killing Allegra Doucet. She says that Max Collins, who sells expensive pieces of artwork, lost millions of dollars in bad investments he made based on Allegra's advice. Porter also informs them that he did some digging and found that a customer at the restaurant where Diane Truby worked was stalking her, and this stalker disappeared shortly after her death. Natalie then takes Monk into Captain Stottlemeyer's office, and privately explains that she is concerned that Monk will be working himself to death solving all of these homicides. Later, Monk and Natalie have a secret rendezvous with Stottlemeyer. The Captain is distressed with the fact that Monk has taken over his position. He also states that the two important things in his life were his job and [[List of Monk characters#Karen Stottlemeyer|his wife]].\n\n====Scott Eggers====\nStottlemeyer uses Disher as an example, stating that Disher is a people person, likeable, non-threatening, and courteous. People tell him things that they wouldn't tell anyone else, which is his gift. He also states that Frank Porter, Cindy Chow and Mad Jack Wyatt have gifts that are the flipside of their curses, and tells Monk to save himself for what he does best and leave the rest of the work to the other three. Heading downtown, Monk calls up Porter for information about John Yamada's ex-wife's stolen car and has Chow check up on Diane Truby's stalker. Monk and Natalie meanwhile go to [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] to talk to Max Collins, Allegra Doucet's client.\n\nCollins states that he had heard about Allegra for quite a while, and then, after he lost $3 million, he had a private investigator do some digging, and found that the companies Collins invested in were paying her to steer wealthy clients her way. He tells Monk and Natalie that on the night Allegra was murdered, he was visiting his mother, just around the corner, so he has an alibi that places him in the neighborhood at the time. To Monk, Collins has means, motive, and opportunity to kill Allegra. Then Officer Curtis calls Natalie to inform them that there is one less tax-paying citizen out there. On the way over to the new murder, Natalie happens to drive over the speed limit and gets pulled over and issued a ticket.\n\nAt this crime scene, Scott Eggers has been found dead in the alley behind his house on Tenth Avenue. Monk sees that the killer bludgeoned Eggers while he was on the way to his car, grabbed a grocery bag from the trash, and suffocated him. Eggers was discovered by his lover, Hank Criswell. Criswell tells them to go arrest Merle Smetter, whom Eggers and Criswell ratted out to the city after catching him installing a hot-tub and redwood deck on his roof without a permit. Monk is not convinced that Smetter could have killed Eggers, when he and Natalie spot Officer Milner there. Milner has been trying to work in overtime to support his family, especially when the number of \"sick\" officers has those who remain stretched far and wide across San Francisco. Milner asks if any progress has been made on the Golden Gate Strangler case. Monk states that there has been none.\n\n====The Golden Gate Strangler is discovered====\nMonk and Natalie return to police headquarters to find the squad room rearranged to Monk's rules of order. Chow states that Diane Truby's stalker has bolted. As Monk is about to ask Officer Curtis to find another pencil holder, Bertrum Gruber walks into the station to say he has found the Golden Gate Strangler. Bertrum says he was at the community garden in [[McKinley Park, Sacramento|McKinley Park]] watering his strawberries when he saw a man clutching a shoe to his chest like it was made of gold. The man then got into his 1999 [[Ford Taurus]], which had a broken left rear taillight and a dent on the bumper. Bertrum continues, saying that the last part of the license plate number was M567, like his mother's birthday (May 5, 1967). Monk has Officer Curtis search for any Ford Tauruses with M567 as the last four digits of the license plate number. Monk believes, however, that Bertrum is being partially dishonest about his facts, since it's not a proper time to grow strawberries.\n\nCurtis enters M567 into the computer. There is a hit, which matches a 1999 Ford Taurus with M567 as the last part of the license plate number to a man named Charlie Herrin. Monk, Natalie, Wyatt, and Arnie organize a [[SWAT]] team to raid Herrin's apartment. After Herrin briefly takes Monk hostage and Wyatt discusses planning on shooting him, Herrin gives himself up. Forensic teams find evidence that confirms Charlie Herrin to be the Golden Gate Strangler. Monk believes that Herrin only recently escalated to murder and has been taking peoples' left shoes for some time. Monk explains to Natalie that he believes Bertrum Gruber to be even more dishonest than before, saying that Bertrum remembered the M567 in Herrin's license plate because it reminded him of his mother's birthday. Now if she was born on May 5, 1967, it means she would have been ten years old when Bertrum was born.\n\n====Officer Down====\nBertrum Gruber receives the $250,000 reward for tipping the police in the right direction. After the press conference, Natalie finds that her car's tires have been slashed. After having the tires replaced, she and Monk return to his apartment and find Stottlemeyer there. The Captain advises Monk to keep his profile as low as possible and not to align himself with the commissioner or with the mayor. Leaving Monk, Natalie gets pulled over as her trunk is open. The next morning, Monk and Natalie find Porter to have replaced the Charlie Herrin cases with the other four open murder cases (Allegra Doucet, John Yamada, Diane Truby and Scott Eggers). Natalie finds Jasper telling Sparrow that Herrin was interested in the way the shoes smelled, and not the shoes themselves. They all go over the details one more time, and realize that they have unknowingly been investigating a serial killer. Except for Allegra Doucet, all of the murder victims are 44 years old, and all of them were born on the ''exact same'' date: February 20, 1962. Monk doesn't know who killed Allegra Doucet or why, but he knows why the other three people were killed, and states that they need to take immediate action.\n\nMonk and Natalie return to Allegra's house with Chow and Jasper. They find that Allegra was killed while she was with a client who was in the bathroom. The killer used the astronomical chart in an attempt to track down the witness. Chow offers to analyze the astronomical chart, as Officer Curtis calls Natalie to report a new homicide. But what she hears next is shocking: the murder victim is Officer Kent Milner.\n\nAt the abandoned warehouse where Milner was found next to his cruiser, Monk and Natalie find Stottlemeyer and Disher there. Many of the \"sick\" detectives have returned, if only to investigate the murder of one of their own. The fact that Milner never unholstered his gun indicates he wasn't expecting trouble. Monk believes that Milner either saw something suspicious and came to check it out, or was meeting with a secret informant. Disher mentions having taken the time to sign up for a class taught by Ian Ludlow, the Tolstoy of the Mean Streets. Monk looks at several brochures in Milner's car, and sees that the rookie officer was looking at new homes in Marin County and at Hawaii travel brochures, like he had money to spend. This is ironic, considering that Kent Milner was at the lowest paying rank in the department.\n\n====Solving Allegra's murder====\nSparrow has observed the astronomical chart from Allegra Doucet's house, and states that the person of interest is charming and creative, but also greedy, secretive and really full of himself, since [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is in [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Venus]] is in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. [[Uranus]] is in [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]. so this client likes his freedom and hasn't had much self-discipline. The fact that [[Neptune]] is in [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] means that he is short-tempered and violent. Monk has solved the case, and knows who killed the astrologer.\n\n====Here's What Happened====\nAs Max Collins is leaving Madam Frost's place in his [[Maserati Quattroporte]], Monk and Natalie arrive. Monk explains that they have come to arrest Madam Frost for the murders of Allegra Doucet, John Yamada, Diane Truby and Scott Eggers. The fact that Collins is underestimating Frost is (according to Monk) the fatal mistake Allegra made. After Monk reveals that Allegra was driving clients away from Madam Frost and putting her neighbor out of business, he gives a summation.\n\nAllegra Doucet was with a client on Friday night, when the client excused himself to go to the bathroom. Madam Frost then showed up on some friendly pretense, but Allegra didn't know what was happening until it was too late. Frost stabbed her several times, enough times that Allegra was dead before her body even hit the floor. Then the toilet flushed and Madam Frost realized that there was another person in the house. By the time she got to the bathroom, the client had escaped out the window. This client had seen too much, and Frost needed to silence him or her. She used the astronomical chart to find people in San Francisco born on February 20, 1962, and used this chart to track the witness down. Frost was in a hurry to kill the witness before he could tell the police. All three of the other murders were improvised, and like Allegra, these victims were killed from behind or by surprise.\n\nWhen Monk and Natalie came to talk to Frost on Saturday morning, she was walking up to her house. She had had to park the car she had just used to kill John Yamada on a side street because the police were blocking her driveway. When she killed Diane Truby, she had bought the vegetable crate so she had something to sit on while waiting for her victim to stroll by. Frost also waited in an alleyway for Scott Eggers. She bludgeoned him, then suffocated him with a bag taken out of the trash. Madam Frost confesses to the murders, and is arrested.\n\nOn Tuesday, [[Charles Kroger|Dr. Kroger]] congratulates Adrian for having been reinstated to the force at last. Kroger explains to Natalie how no one asked him about Porter, Chow or Wyatt, whom he had referred to the department earlier. Dr. Kroger states that under normal circumstances they wouldn't be back at the department. Returning to the squad room, Wyatt explains that Porter put together a list of witnesses and they found their murder witness: Tono Busok, who didn't come to the police out of fear that his bootlegging operation would be discovered.\n\n===Kent Milner===\nStottlemeyer and the \"sick\" detectives have found nothing about Kent Milner's death. His arrest sheet shows that he mostly made minor arrests. Monk explains how Bertrum Gruber wasn't being entirely honest about his facts when he gave his tip to the police, and reveals that Bertrum is the person who killed Officer Milner. Monk shows that Milner arrested Bertrum eight months earlier for making an illegal drug buy in [[Potrero Hill]], Milner's jurisdiction. There's no coincidence about how one of Charlie Herrin's victims was disposed of here. Herrin is indeed the Strangler, Monk says, as he reveals that Bertrum Gruber didn't identify Charlie Herrin as the Golden Gate Strangler. Rather, it was Kent Milner who did. But as Milner was a police officer and hence a city employee, he couldn't collect the reward, so he recruited Bertrum to find it on the grounds they would split the money. But Bertrum wanted all of the money, so he killed Milner.\n\nMonk and Natalie go to the jail to question Charlie Herrin. Herrin's left shoe craze is still present, and he takes Natalie's shoe. Monk shows a picture of Officer Milner, and Herrin remembers Milner as the officer who pulled him over for speeding on Saturday. Herrin accidentally had run a red light and clipped another car in the intersection, but they both walked away like nothing happened. He dented his bumper and broke one of his rear taillights. Then Herrin got pulled over for doing 35 MPH in a 25 MPH zone. Herrin was still clutching one of the murder victims' shoes, and he threw it in the back seat just before Officer Milner stepped up to the car. Milner issued Herrin a ticket, but he also saw the shoes and realized that he had just accidentally found the Golden Gate Strangler.\n\nAfter Natalie gets some new shoes to replace the ones Herrin took from her, she calls Bertrum Gruber asking him to meet them at the pier. At the pier, Bertrum gives them the statement he gave to them earlier. Monk reveals that Herrin didn't break his taillight or dent his bumper until ''after'' he left the park, and that Bertrum's mother can't have been born on May 5, 1967. All of the statements Bertrum was giving were in fact the very information that Officer Kent Milner gave him when he agreed to the scheme of taking half of the reward. Stottlemeyer explains that they've got a search warrant and are going to be testing his clothes for [[gunshot residue]] that will match the gun that killed Milner.\n\nBertrum puts a gun to Monk's head, and threatens to shoot, but when Monk vomits on the dock, Bertrum is distracted long enough that he is tackled to the ground and arrested. Mayor Smitrovich is humiliated that he rewarded a cop killer, and he caves in to all of the police union's demands in exchange for a cover up in the press, making it seem like he knew Bertrum was guilty all along and was cooperating with the police in a sting.\n\nMonk feels glad to have been reinstated, when Stottlemeyer tells Monk that his reinstatement is now void. Natalie is furious, but Stottlemeyer says he has no wish of extending the mayor's offer. Natalie tells the other detectives' assistants to keep in touch with each other from time to time. After the speeding ticket from earlier, Monk is able to convince Natalie to go to traffic school.\n\n==List of characters==\n\n===Characters from the television series===\n*'''[[Adrian Monk]]''' - the titular detective, played on the series by [[Tony Shalhoub]]\n*'''[[Natalie Teeger]]''' - Monk's loyal assistant and the narrator of the book, played on the series by [[Traylor Howard]]\n*'''Captain [[Leland Stottlemeyer]]''' - Captain of the Homicide Division, Monk's oldest friend and former partner, played on the series by [[Ted Levine]]\n*'''Lieutenant [[Randy Disher]]''' - Stottlemeyer's right-hand man, played on the series by [[Jason Gray-Stanford]]\n*'''Dr. [[Charles Kroger]]''' - Monk's [[psychiatrist]], played on the series by [[Stanley Kamel]]\n*'''[[Julie Teeger]]''' - Natalie's teenaged daughter, played on the series by [[Emmy Clarke]]\n\n===Original characters===\n*'''Officer Susan Curtis''' - A female officer in charge of clerical duties in the Homicide division.\n*'''\"Mad\" Jack Wyatt''' - A veteran detective who was kicked off of the force after the city lost several lawsuits from his violent and unconventional methods.\n*'''Cynthia \"Cindy\" Chow''' - A [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenic]] who believes that everything is a conspiracy theory.

This is the last time Tony Shalhoub's wife makes an appearance on the show.\n\n===Plot synopsis===\n[[Leland Stottlemeyer|Captain Stottlemeyer]] calls [[Adrian Monk]] to his office for some important news. Monk assumes the worst, but the news is actually positive. After twelve years, Monk's wish of being reinstated to the police force has been fulfilled.\n\nMonk is nervous and excited for his first day back. As [[Natalie Teeger|Natalie]] sends Monk off to work, she reveals that she has an interview for a glamorous job with a concert promoter. As Monk and Natalie say goodbye, Monk laments that this could be the end of their partnership.\n\nAt police headquarters, Monk receives a warm welcome from his fellow officers. Stottlemeyer has even arranged for Monk to sit at the same desk he used years before. Monk is disappointed to learn, however, that he's been relegated to desk duty in the case of the [[Pickaxe|Pick Axe]] Killer, the department's hottest case. Later that day, Officer Russell DiMarco, a colleague of Monk's, bursts into the office announcing that the Pick Axe Killer has been arrested. A [[window washer]] named Mikhail \"Manny\" Almonov saw someone matching the killer's description and tipped off the police. It's great news, but Monk is a little disappointed that the case was solved without his help.\n\nA week later, Natalie is enjoying her exciting new job in the music business, and Monk has left his desk job to begin working with a new partner, Detective Doyle. Monk has suspicions about Manny Almonov's story, so he takes a break from his work with Doyle to investigate the location where Manny claimed that he had \"spotted\" the Pick Axe Killer. Monk quickly establishes that it would have been impossible for Manny to see the killer from that vantage point. Although Monk shares this information with his superiors, no one wants to entertain any theories that might interfere with the successful closure of a highly publicized case, especially since the man who was arrested on the window washer's tip confessed to being the Pick Axe Killer.\n\nThat night, Officer DiMarco is on his way home and meets with Manny Almonov. After DiMarco receives his payoff, Manny shoots him dead.\n\nThe police believe that Russell DiMarco saw something going down on his way home, tried to intervene, and was killed. But Monk suspects that DiMarco may have been murdered while receiving some kind of illegal [[Bribery|payoff]]. Monk's theory makes him a pariah, as cops are supposed to protect the reputations of their brethren. If Monk has any hope of surviving in his new job, he needs to back up his accusations against Officer DiMarco. When Monk comes across Officer DiMarco's ticket book, he finds the evidence he needs to prove his theory and arrest Manny Almanov for the murder.\n\n====Here's What Happened====\nMonk finds Manny standing on a scaffold, preparing to work on a window-washing job. Monk explains what happened. Manny didn't spot the Pick Axe Killer - Officer DiMarco did. Monk figured this out when he found DiMarco's ticket book and noticed that he had written but never submitted a [[parking ticket]] for the killer's car. DiMarco had found the Pick Axe Killer, but as a police officer, he couldn't collect the reward. He wanted the reward, and recruited an old friend of his, Manny Almonov, to identify the killer. Manny made up a story, and took credit for the tip. They agreed to split the reward money later, but Manny got greedy and decided to kill DiMarco instead.\n\nMonk has solved the case, but now he's got a major problem. Manny has knocked out Monk and put him on the [[scaffold]]. Manny raises the scaffold and tries to push Monk off. Monk struggles with Manny as his fellow police officers watch from below. Monk wins the struggle and lowers the scaffold back to street level, where his coworkers are waiting. It's clear that Monk was right all along, and Manny is taken into custody.\n\nDespite having solved a murder during his short time back with the police, Monk decides to relinquish his badge. Natalie, who's missed the excitement of working with Monk, agrees to return to her job as his assistant. Monk is disappointed that his return to the force didn't last, but now he knows that he doesn't need a badge to be happy. He can go forward to find contentment in his life with Natalie by his side, solving crimes on his own unique terms.\n\n{{Monk (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mr. Monk And The Blue Flu}}\n[[Category:2007 American novels]]\n[[Category:2009 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Monk (novel series)]]\n[[Category:Monk (TV series) episodes]]\n[[Category:Novels set in San Francisco]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{anchor|Episode adaption}}Episode adaptation:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Monk_and_the_Blue_Flu"}
