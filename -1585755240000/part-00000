The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield]], while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph \"Ole Ran'l\" McCoy]]. Those involved in the [[feud]] were descended from Joseph Hatfield and William McCoy (born&nbsp;{{circa}}&nbsp;1750). The feud has entered the [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties. \n\nThe McCoy family lived mostly on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork; the Hatfields lived mostly on the West Virginia side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |title=From Roots to Nuts: Hatfield Thomas, I |work=Genfan.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021439/http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/military-figure/devil-anse-hatfield |title=Devil Anse Hatfield Biography (1839\u20131921) |author=<!-- Biography.com Editors --> |date=December 4, 2014 |website=Biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> The majority of the Hatfields, although living in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]] (then part of [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]) fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]; most McCoys also fought for the Confederates,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/05/29/how-realistic-is-hatfields-and-mccoys/ |title=How Realistic is 'Hatfields and McCoys'? |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=May 29, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of [[Confederate Home Guard]]s called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.{{sfnp|Pearce|1994|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nThe Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. Anse's [[Logging|timbering]] operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran'l owned a {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal [[moonshine]], a popular commodity at the time.\n\n==Feud==\n[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|The Hatfield clan in 1897]]\nAsa Harmon McCoy joined the [[45th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Mounted Infantry|45th Kentucky Infantry]] on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was \"captured by Rebels\" on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in [[Maryland]]. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War, Asa joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862, and a group of which attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of [[Devil Anse Hatfield]]. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse took credit for the deed. Runyon later joined the [[39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|39th Kentucky Infantry]] and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say \"Killed by Rebels\". \n\nOn [[muster rolls]] beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa is reported in a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its regiments out of service. Asa's Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]]. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the [[Union Army]]. A group of Confederate [[guerilla]]s took credit for the killing and his wife's pension application states that he was \"killed by Rebels\". There are no existing records pertaining to his death and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James \"Jim\" Vance, an uncle of Anse and a member of a West Virginia Militia group, as the culprit.<ref>{{cite book |title=The McCoys: Their Story |first=Truda |last=Williams McCoy |publisher=Press of the Preservation Council of Pike County |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-91681-400-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite archive |item=Fold 3 |collection=Compiled Service Records of Union Soldiers 1861\u20131865 |institution=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Wayne County, West Virginia in the Civil War |first=Jack L. |last=Dickinson |year=2003 |publisher=Higginson Book Co. |isbn=978-0-74044-086-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Clines and Allied Families of The Tug River Valley |first=Cecil L. |last=Cline |year=1998 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Gateway Press}}</ref>\n\nThe second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Anse's, had the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html |title=Hatfield-McCoy Feud 75 Years Old Today |first=Shirley |last=Donnelly |newspaper=[[The Register-Herald|Beckley Post-Herald]] |date=August 7, 1957 |via=WV Culture.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> saying that the notches on the pig's ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks.

Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky [[rum-running|bootlegging]] warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]]. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.\n\nThe feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna's younger brothers: Tolbert, Phamer (Pharmer), and Bud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0807.html|title=On This Day in West Virginia History - August 7|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and his other brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield [[constable]]s and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Anse organized a large group of followers and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia. When Ellison died from his injuries, the McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields' [[vigilantism|vigilante justice]] in turn: being tied to [[Asimina|pawpaw]] bushes, where each was shot numerous times with a total of fifty shots fired. Their bodies were described as \"bullet-riddled\".{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=26}}\n\nEven though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Cline, who was married to Martha McCoy, is believed to have used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields' arrest as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline lost a lawsuit against Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families. In 1886, Jeff McCoy killed a mail carrier named Fred Wolford, and the man who went to pursue him for his crime was acting constable Cap Hatfield. Cap and a friend named Tom Wallace shot him while on the run on the banks of the Tug Fork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kleber |first=John |encyclopedia=The Kentucky Encyclopedia |title=Hatfields and McCoys |date=May 18, 1992 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-81311-772-0 |page=418}}</ref> Tom Wallace was soon found dead in the spring of 1887.\n\n===New Year Massacre===\nThe feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year's Night Massacre.

With his house burning, Randolph and his remaining family members were able to escape to the woods; his children, unprepared for the elements, suffered [[frostbite]]. The remaining McCoys moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.

Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]] and buried in an unmarked grave within sight of the gallows. {{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=111}} \n\nEllison had tried to retract his [[confession]], stating that he was innocent, and that he had only confessed because he expected leniency {{ndash}} but his retraction was denied. Thousands attended his hanging in Pikeville, but though the scaffold was in the open, its base was fenced in to comply with laws that had been passed which prohibited public executions. The hanging site is the current location of a classroom building of the present day [[University of Pikeville]]. With his last words, Ellison claimed that; \"The Hatfields made me do it. \" No one had been sent to the gallows in Pike County for forty years, and after Ellison, no one ever was again. \n\nOf those sent to prison:\n* Valentine \"Uncle Wall\" Hatfield, elder brother of Anse, was overshadowed by Anse's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.\n* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.\n* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served fourteen years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.\n\nFighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts.

Many improvements to various feud sites were completed.

The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield]], while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph \"Ole Ran'l\" McCoy]]. Those involved in the [[feud]] were descended from Joseph Hatfield and William McCoy (born&nbsp;{{circa}}&nbsp;1750). The feud has entered the [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties. \n\nThe McCoy family lived mostly on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork; the Hatfields lived mostly on the West Virginia side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |title=From Roots to Nuts: Hatfield Thomas, I |work=Genfan.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021439/http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&tree=MASTER |archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/military-figure/devil-anse-hatfield |title=Devil Anse Hatfield Biography (1839\u20131921) |author=<!-- Biography.com Editors --> |date=December 4, 2014 |website=Biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> The majority of the Hatfields, although living in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]] (then part of [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]) fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]; most McCoys also fought for the Confederates,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/05/29/how-realistic-is-hatfields-and-mccoys/ |title=How Realistic is 'Hatfields and McCoys'? |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=May 29, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of [[Confederate Home Guard]]s called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.{{sfnp|Pearce|1994|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nThe Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. Anse's [[Logging|timbering]] operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran'l owned a {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal [[moonshine]], a popular commodity at the time.\n\n==Feud==\n[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|The Hatfield clan in 1897]]\nAsa Harmon McCoy joined the [[45th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Mounted Infantry|45th Kentucky Infantry]] on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was \"captured by Rebels\" on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in [[Maryland]]. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War, Asa joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862, and a group of which attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of [[Devil Anse Hatfield]]. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse took credit for the deed. Runyon later joined the [[39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|39th Kentucky Infantry]] and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say \"Killed by Rebels\". \n\nOn [[muster rolls]] beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa is reported in a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its regiments out of service. Asa's Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]]. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the [[Union Army]]. A group of Confederate [[guerilla]]s took credit for the killing and his wife's pension application states that he was \"killed by Rebels\". There are no existing records pertaining to his death and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James \"Jim\" Vance, an uncle of Anse and a member of a West Virginia Militia group, as the culprit.<ref>{{cite book |title=The McCoys: Their Story |first=Truda |last=Williams McCoy |publisher=Press of the Preservation Council of Pike County |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-91681-400-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite archive |item=Fold 3 |collection=Compiled Service Records of Union Soldiers 1861\u20131865 |institution=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Wayne County, West Virginia in the Civil War |first=Jack L. |last=Dickinson |year=2003 |publisher=Higginson Book Co. |isbn=978-0-74044-086-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Clines and Allied Families of The Tug River Valley |first=Cecil L. |last=Cline |year=1998 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Gateway Press}}</ref>\n\nThe second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Anse's, had the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html |title=Hatfield-McCoy Feud 75 Years Old Today |first=Shirley |last=Donnelly |newspaper=[[The Register-Herald|Beckley Post-Herald]] |date=August 7, 1957 |via=WV Culture.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> saying that the notches on the pig's ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks.

Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky [[rum-running|bootlegging]] warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]]. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.\n\nThe feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna's younger brothers: Tolbert, Phamer (Pharmer), and Bud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0807.html|title=On This Day in West Virginia History - August 7|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and his other brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield [[constable]]s and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Anse organized a large group of followers and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia. When Ellison died from his injuries, the McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields' [[vigilantism|vigilante justice]] in turn: being tied to [[Asimina|pawpaw]] bushes, where each was shot numerous times with a total of fifty shots fired. Their bodies were described as \"bullet-riddled\".{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=26}}\n\nEven though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Cline, who was married to Martha McCoy, is believed to have used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields' arrest as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline lost a lawsuit against Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families. In 1886, Jeff McCoy killed a mail carrier named Fred Wolford, and the man who went to pursue him for his crime was acting constable Cap Hatfield. Cap and a friend named Tom Wallace shot him while on the run on the banks of the Tug Fork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kleber |first=John |encyclopedia=The Kentucky Encyclopedia |title=Hatfields and McCoys |date=May 18, 1992 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-81311-772-0 |page=418}}</ref> Tom Wallace was soon found dead in the spring of 1887.\n\n===New Year Massacre===\nThe feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year's Night Massacre.

Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]] and buried in an unmarked grave within sight of the gallows. {{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=111}} \n\nEllison had tried to retract his [[confession]], stating that he was innocent, and that he had only confessed because he expected leniency {{ndash}} but his retraction was denied. Thousands attended his hanging in Pikeville, but though the scaffold was in the open, its base was fenced in to comply with laws that had been passed which prohibited public executions. The hanging site is the current location of a classroom building of the present day [[University of Pikeville]]. With his last words, Ellison claimed that; \"The Hatfields made me do it. \" No one had been sent to the gallows in Pike County for forty years, and after Ellison, no one ever was again. \n\nOf those sent to prison:\n* Valentine \"Uncle Wall\" Hatfield, elder brother of Anse, was overshadowed by Anse's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.\n* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.\n* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served fourteen years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.\n\nFighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts.

{"title_page": "Demogorgon", "text_new": "{{About|the phantom demon Demogorgon|other uses of this term|Demogorgon (disambiguation)}}\n<!--this article has used the convention AD since its inception-->\n\n'''Demogorgon''' is a [[deity]] or [[demon]], associated with the [[underworld]] and envisaged as a powerful [[Greek primordial deities|primordial]] being, whose very name had been [[taboo]]. Although often ascribed to [[Greek mythology]], the name probably arises from an unknown copyist's misreading of a commentary by a fourth-century scholar, [[Lactantius Placidus]]. The concept itself though can be traced back to the original misread term [[demiurge]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the name ''Demogorgon'' are not entirely clear, though the most prevalent scholarly view now considers it to be a misreading of the Greek \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd (''d\u0113miourg\u00f3n'', [[accusative case]] form of \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, '[[demiurge]]') based on the manuscript variations in the earliest known explicit reference in Lactantius Placidus (Jahnke 1898, Sweeney 1997, Solomon 2012). [[Boccaccio]], in his influential ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]'', cites a now lost work by [[Theodontius]], and that master's acknowledged Byzantine source, \"[[Pronapides|Pronapides the Athenian]]\", as authority for the idea that Demogorgon is the antecedent of all the gods. Art historian [[Jean Seznec]] concludes that \"Demogorgon is a grammatical error, become god.\" <ref>{{Cite book | last=Seznec | first=Jean | title=La Survivance des dieux antiques | year=1940 | trans-title=Survival of the Pagan Gods | translator-last1=Sessions |translator-first1=Barbara | publisher=Princeton University Press |series=Bollingen Series | location=Princeton, New Jersey | publication-date=1972 | pages=221\u2013222 }}</ref>\n\nThe name variants cited by Jahnke include the Latin \"demoirgon\", \"emoirgon\", \"demogorgona\", \"demogorgon\", with the first critical editor Friedrich Lindenbrog (Fridericus Tiliobroga) having conjectured \"\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\" as the prototype in 1600. Various other theories suggest that the name is derived from a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd ''[[daimon]]'' ('[[soul|spirit]]' given the Christian connotations of 'demon' in the early Middle Ages)\u2014or, less likely \u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|d\u00eamos]]'' (\"people\")\u2014and \u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 ''gorg\u00f3s'' (\"quick\") or \u0393\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd ''[[Gorgon|Gorg\u1e53n]]'', the Ancient Greek monsters first attested in Hesiod's ''Theogony''.<ref>Hes. ''Th.'' 270-282</ref>\n\n==Derivation and history==\nDemogorgon is first mentioned in the commentary on [[Statius]]'s ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]''<ref>Statius, ''Thebaid'' iv.500-518, a passage often linked (see below) to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], ''[[Pharsalia]]'' vi.744\u201349, where, however, Demogorgon is not specified. See notes to Lucan 6.744 in G. Viansino's edition (Mondadori, 1995).</ref> often attributed in manuscripts to a [[Lactantius Placidus]], (c. 350\u2013400 AD). The Lactantius Placidus commentary became the most common medieval commentary on the poem by Statius and is transmitted in most early editions up to 1600.<ref>H. Anderson, ''The Manuscripts of Statius'' (Arlington, VA, 2009), vol. 2, pp. 83\u201385 and 191\u2013202</ref> The commentary has been attributed incorrectly to a different Lactantius, the Christian author [[Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius]], even though the commentator appears to have been [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]].<ref>J. Fran\u00e7ois, ''Le Scoliaste de la Th\u00e9ba\u00efde de Stace'', M\u00e9moire de licence, Li\u00e8ge, 1936, p. 82. R.D. Sweeney (ed., ''Lactantii Placidi in Statii Thebaida commentarii libri XII'' (Stuttgart/Leipzig: Teubner) 1997) also indicates that another Placidus, a Christian grammarian, is not to be confused with this Lactantius: {{\"'}}glossae Placidi (ut uidetur, Christiani) nullo modo auctori nostro sunt adscribendae{{'\"}} (p. viii).</ref>\n\nThe name ''Demogorgon'' is introduced in a discussion of ''Thebaid'' 4.516, which mentions \"the supreme being of the threefold world\" (''triplicis mundi summum''). In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, ''Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet'' (\"He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know\", or perhaps \"He is speaking of a god, the supreme Demogorgon\"). Prior to Lactantius, there is no mention of the supposed \"Demogorgon\" anywhere by any writer, pagan or Christian. However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives \"demoirgon\", which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek ''d\u0113miourgon''. Jahnke thus restores the text to read \"He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know\". However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century ''Adnotationes super Lucanum'', a series of short notes to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' that are included in the ''[[Commenta Bernensia]]'', the \"Berne Scholia on Lucan\".<ref>[http://www.chronarchy.com/esus/lucan-commentaries.html \"The Berne Scholia\"]; ''Adnotationes super Lucanum,'' vi.746, are mentioned in Daniel Ogden's ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 198.</ref>\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial \"Demogorgon\" was so well fixed in the European imagination that \"Demogorgon's son Pan\" became a bizarre variant reading for \"Hermes' son Pan\" in one manuscript tradition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia Deorum gentilium]]'' (\"Genealogies of the Gods\":1.3\u20134 and 2.1), misreading a line in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBoccaccio's ''Demogorgon'' is mentioned as a \"primal\" god in quite a few [[Renaissance]] texts, and impressively [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]ed \"Demon-Gorgon,\" i.e., \"Terror-Demon\" or \"God of the Earth\". The French historian and mythographer [[Jean Seznec]], for instance, now determines in ''Demogorgon'' an allusion to the [[Demiurge]] (\"Craftsman\" or \"Maker\") of [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus.'']] For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid's Demiurge (1/1, here) as \"sovereign Demogorgon\", see the paraphrase of ''Metamorphoses'' I in Abraham France, ''The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch'' (London, 1592), sig. A2v.\"<ref>Dr Daniel Kinney, \"Ovid Illustrated: The Renaissance Reception of Ovid in Image and Text\" linked below.</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nDemogorgon was taken up by Christian writers as a demon of Hell:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\nOf Demogorgon</poem>|[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' II. 966.}}\n\nNote, however, Milton does not refer to the inhabitants of Hell, but of an unformed region where [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] rules with Night. In Milton's epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth.\n\nDemogorgon's name was earlier invoked by [[Faust]]us in Scene III of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons [[Mephistopheles]] with a Latin incantation.\n\nThe sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist [[Johann Weyer]] described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell's hierarchy.<ref name=\"rudwin87\">{{cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian|title=The Devil in Legend and Literature|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1970|origyear=1931|edition=2nd|page=80|isbn=0-404-05451-X}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s lesser work ''I Cinque Canti'',<ref>[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Opere_minori_1_(Ariosto)/I_Cinque_Canti/Canto_I] Ludovico Ariosto - Opere minori (tomo I)</ref> Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today's Himalaya) where every five years [[Moirai|the Fates]] and [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions. They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a [[Witches' Sabbath]]. When elements of Ariosto's poem supplied [[Philippe Quinault]]'s libretto for [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera ''Roland'', performed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies.\n\nDemogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem ''[[El Bernardo]]'' written in Mexico by [[Bernardo de Balbuena]] and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, \"Alcina\", visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace:\n<blockquote>Aqu\u00ed Demogorgon est\u00e1 sentado<br>en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto<br>de las supremas causas es guardado<br>por inviolable y celestial preceto.<br>Las parcas y su estambre delicado<br>a cuyo huso el mundo est\u00e1 sujeto,<br>la fea muerte y el vivir l\u00facido<br>y el negro lago del oscuro olvido\n<br> \u2014 (Libro II, estrofa 19)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is mentioned in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'':\n\n<blockquote>A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>At which [[Cocytus]] quakes, and [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] is put to flight.\n<br> \u2014 (Canto I, stanza 37)</blockquote>\n\nand:\n\n<blockquote>Downe in the bottome of the deepe ''Abysse''<br>Where ''Demogorgon'' in dull darknesse pent,<br>Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>The hideous ''Chaos'' keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. \n<br> \u2014 (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is the central character in [[Voltaire]]'s 1756 short story \"[[Plato's Dream]]\" - a \"lesser superbeing\" who was responsible for creating the planet Earth.\n\nHe is also the protagonist of an opera ''Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso'' (\"Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher\" by [[Vincenzo Righini]] (1786) with a libretto by [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], which originally was written for [[Mozart]].<ref>\"Non tardar amato bene,\" left incomplete by Mozart was inserted in Da Ponte's next project, ''Il Demogorgone'' (D. Heartz, \"Mozart and Da Ponte\", ''The Musical Quarterly'', 1995); the question \" how did Righini wind up setting a text written for Mozart, and how could\na text designed for a different opera fit successfully into II demogorgone?\" is addressed in \nJ Stone, \"Mozart's Theory of Opera, 13 October 1781\" ''The Musical Times'', 1991.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', the first mate of the ship, ''Pequod'', Starbuck, describes [[Moby Dick (whale)|the white whale]] as the demogorgon of the ship's \"heathen crew\" (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2).\n\nDemogorgon also appears as a character in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Thetis]] who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon's name originating from Greek ''demos'' and ''gorgos'' may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace.<ref>Paul Foot. ''[[Red Shelley]]''. p. 194</ref> Shelley's allusions to the [[French Revolution]] further support this.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn the poem \"Demogorgon\" by [[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]], the writer is afraid of becoming mad by learning the true nature and unveiling the mystery of life.<ref>[http://www.citador.pt/poemas.php?op=10&refid=200809030410 Poema: Demogorgon] - \u00c1lvaro de Campos - Poesia/Poemas no Citador, citador.pt</ref>\n\n==In gaming==\n===''Dungeons & Dragons''===\nIn the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], '''Demogorgon''' is a powerful [[demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon prince]].

Although often ascribed to [[Greek mythology]], the name probably arises from an unknown copyist's misreading of a commentary by a fourth-century scholar, [[Lactantius Placidus]]. The concept itself though can be traced back to the original misread term [[demiurge]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the name ''Demogorgon'' are not entirely clear, though the most prevalent scholarly view now considers it to be a misreading of the Greek \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd (''d\u0113miourg\u00f3n'', [[accusative case]] form of \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, '[[demiurge]]') based on the manuscript variations in the earliest known explicit reference in Lactantius Placidus (Jahnke 1898, Sweeney 1997, Solomon 2012). [[Boccaccio]], in his influential ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]'', cites a now lost work by [[Theodontius]], and that master's acknowledged Byzantine source, \"[[Pronapides|Pronapides the Athenian]]\", as authority for the idea that Demogorgon is the antecedent of all the gods. Art historian [[Jean Seznec]] concludes that \"Demogorgon is a grammatical error, become god.\" <ref>{{Cite book | last=Seznec | first=Jean | title=La Survivance des dieux antiques | year=1940 | trans-title=Survival of the Pagan Gods | translator-last1=Sessions |translator-first1=Barbara | publisher=Princeton University Press |series=Bollingen Series | location=Princeton, New Jersey | publication-date=1972 | pages=221\u2013222 }}</ref>\n\nThe name variants cited by Jahnke include the Latin \"demoirgon\", \"emoirgon\", \"demogorgona\", \"demogorgon\", with the first critical editor Friedrich Lindenbrog (Fridericus Tiliobroga) having conjectured \"\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\" as the prototype in 1600. Various other theories suggest that the name is derived from a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd ''[[daimon]]'' ('[[soul|spirit]]' given the Christian connotations of 'demon' in the early Middle Ages)\u2014or, less likely \u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|d\u00eamos]]'' (\"people\")\u2014and \u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 ''gorg\u00f3s'' (\"quick\") or \u0393\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd ''[[Gorgon|Gorg\u1e53n]]'', the Ancient Greek monsters first attested in Hesiod's ''Theogony''.<ref>Hes. ''Th.'' 270-282</ref>\n\n==Derivation and history==\nDemogorgon is first mentioned in the commentary on [[Statius]]'s ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]''<ref>Statius, ''Thebaid'' iv.500-518, a passage often linked (see below) to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], ''[[Pharsalia]]'' vi.744\u201349, where, however, Demogorgon is not specified. See notes to Lucan 6.744 in G. Viansino's edition (Mondadori, 1995).</ref> often attributed in manuscripts to a [[Lactantius Placidus]], (c. 350\u2013400 AD). The Lactantius Placidus commentary became the most common medieval commentary on the poem by Statius and is transmitted in most early editions up to 1600.<ref>H. Anderson, ''The Manuscripts of Statius'' (Arlington, VA, 2009), vol. 2, pp. 83\u201385 and 191\u2013202</ref> The commentary has been attributed incorrectly to a different Lactantius, the Christian author [[Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius]], even though the commentator appears to have been [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]].<ref>J. Fran\u00e7ois, ''Le Scoliaste de la Th\u00e9ba\u00efde de Stace'', M\u00e9moire de licence, Li\u00e8ge, 1936, p. 82. R.D. Sweeney (ed., ''Lactantii Placidi in Statii Thebaida commentarii libri XII'' (Stuttgart/Leipzig: Teubner) 1997) also indicates that another Placidus, a Christian grammarian, is not to be confused with this Lactantius: {{\"'}}glossae Placidi (ut uidetur, Christiani) nullo modo auctori nostro sunt adscribendae{{'\"}} (p. viii).</ref>\n\nThe name ''Demogorgon'' is introduced in a discussion of ''Thebaid'' 4.516, which mentions \"the supreme being of the threefold world\" (''triplicis mundi summum''). In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, ''Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet'' (\"He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know\", or perhaps \"He is speaking of a god, the supreme Demogorgon\"). Prior to Lactantius, there is no mention of the supposed \"Demogorgon\" anywhere by any writer, pagan or Christian. However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives \"demoirgon\", which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek ''d\u0113miourgon''. Jahnke thus restores the text to read \"He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know\". However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century ''Adnotationes super Lucanum'', a series of short notes to [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' that are included in the ''[[Commenta Bernensia]]'', the \"Berne Scholia on Lucan\".<ref>[http://www.chronarchy.com/esus/lucan-commentaries.html \"The Berne Scholia\"]; ''Adnotationes super Lucanum,'' vi.746, are mentioned in Daniel Ogden's ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 198.</ref>\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial \"Demogorgon\" was so well fixed in the European imagination that \"Demogorgon's son Pan\" became a bizarre variant reading for \"Hermes' son Pan\" in one manuscript tradition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia Deorum gentilium]]'' (\"Genealogies of the Gods\":1.3\u20134 and 2.1), misreading a line in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBoccaccio's ''Demogorgon'' is mentioned as a \"primal\" god in quite a few [[Renaissance]] texts, and impressively [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]ed \"Demon-Gorgon,\" i.e., \"Terror-Demon\" or \"God of the Earth\". The French historian and mythographer [[Jean Seznec]], for instance, now determines in ''Demogorgon'' an allusion to the [[Demiurge]] (\"Craftsman\" or \"Maker\") of [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus.'']] For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid's Demiurge (1/1, here) as \"sovereign Demogorgon\", see the paraphrase of ''Metamorphoses'' I in Abraham France, ''The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch'' (London, 1592), sig. A2v.\"<ref>Dr Daniel Kinney, \"Ovid Illustrated: The Renaissance Reception of Ovid in Image and Text\" linked below.</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nDemogorgon was taken up by Christian writers as a demon of Hell:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\nOf Demogorgon</poem>|[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' II. 966.}}\n\nNote, however, Milton does not refer to the inhabitants of Hell, but of an unformed region where [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] rules with Night. In Milton's epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth.\n\nDemogorgon's name was earlier invoked by [[Faust]]us in Scene III of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons [[Mephistopheles]] with a Latin incantation.\n\nThe sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist [[Johann Weyer]] described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell's hierarchy.<ref name=\"rudwin87\">{{cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian|title=The Devil in Legend and Literature|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1970|origyear=1931|edition=2nd|page=80|isbn=0-404-05451-X}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s lesser work ''I Cinque Canti'',<ref>[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Opere_minori_1_(Ariosto)/I_Cinque_Canti/Canto_I] Ludovico Ariosto - Opere minori (tomo I)</ref> Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today's Himalaya) where every five years [[Moirai|the Fates]] and [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions. They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a [[Witches' Sabbath]]. When elements of Ariosto's poem supplied [[Philippe Quinault]]'s libretto for [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera ''Roland'', performed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies.\n\nDemogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem ''[[El Bernardo]]'' written in Mexico by [[Bernardo de Balbuena]] and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, \"Alcina\", visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace:\n<blockquote>Aqu\u00ed Demogorgon est\u00e1 sentado<br>en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto<br>de las supremas causas es guardado<br>por inviolable y celestial preceto.<br>Las parcas y su estambre delicado<br>a cuyo huso el mundo est\u00e1 sujeto,<br>la fea muerte y el vivir l\u00facido<br>y el negro lago del oscuro olvido\n<br> \u2014 (Libro II, estrofa 19)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is mentioned in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'':\n\n<blockquote>A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>At which [[Cocytus]] quakes, and [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] is put to flight.\n<br> \u2014 (Canto I, stanza 37)</blockquote>\n\nand:\n\n<blockquote>Downe in the bottome of the deepe ''Abysse''<br>Where ''Demogorgon'' in dull darknesse pent,<br>Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>The hideous ''Chaos'' keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. \n<br> \u2014 (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)</blockquote>\n\nDemogorgon is the central character in [[Voltaire]]'s 1756 short story \"[[Plato's Dream]]\" - a \"lesser superbeing\" who was responsible for creating the planet Earth.\n\nHe is also the protagonist of an opera ''Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso'' (\"Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher\" by [[Vincenzo Righini]] (1786) with a libretto by [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], which originally was written for [[Mozart]].<ref>\"Non tardar amato bene,\" left incomplete by Mozart was inserted in Da Ponte's next project, ''Il Demogorgone'' (D. Heartz, \"Mozart and Da Ponte\", ''The Musical Quarterly'', 1995); the question \" how did Righini wind up setting a text written for Mozart, and how could\na text designed for a different opera fit successfully into II demogorgone?\" is addressed in \nJ Stone, \"Mozart's Theory of Opera, 13 October 1781\" ''The Musical Times'', 1991.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', the first mate of the ship, ''Pequod'', Starbuck, describes [[Moby Dick (whale)|the white whale]] as the demogorgon of the ship's \"heathen crew\" (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2).\n\nDemogorgon also appears as a character in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Thetis]] who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon's name originating from Greek ''demos'' and ''gorgos'' may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace.<ref>Paul Foot.

Instead of the [[quarterback]] receiving the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] at the [[line of scrimmage]], in the shotgun he stands farther back, often five to seven yards off the line. Sometimes the quarterback will have a back on one or both sides before the snap, while other times he will be the lone player in the backfield with everyone spread out as receivers. \n\nThe shotgun formation can offer certain advantages. The offensive linemen have more room to maneuver behind the scrimmage line and form a tighter, more cohesive oval \u201cpocket\u201d in which the quarterback is protected from \u201cblitzing\u201d by the defense.  If the quarterback has speed, mobility or both, he can use this formation to scramble before his pass; or, to run to an open field position in the defensive secondary or to the sideline, usually gaining first-down yardage.  \n\nAlthough some running plays can be run effectively from the shotgun, the formation also has weaknesses. The defense knows a pass is more than likely coming, particularly from an empty set lacking any running backs, and there is a higher risk of a botched snap than in a simple center/quarterback exchange.  If the defense is planning a pass rush, this formation gives fast defensive players more open and exposed targets in the offensive backfield, with less cluttered \u201cblitzing\u201d routes to the quarterback and any other [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] in the offensive backfield.\n\nShotgun combines elements of the [[short punt formation|short punt]] and spread formations \u2014 \"spread\" in that it has receivers spread widely instead of close to or behind the interior line players. The origins of the term are thought to be that it is like a \"shotgun\" in spraying receivers around the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1184750-25-craziest-football-terms-and-where-they-come-from|title=BleacherReport, Craziest Football Terms and Where They Come From}}</ref> (The alignment of the players also suggests the shape of an actual shotgun.) Formations similar or identical to the shotgun used decades previously would be called names such as \"spread double wing\".

A further development of the play is a [[halfback option pass]], with the [[quarterback]] being one of the eligible receivers. [[Roger Staubach]]'s backup and successor, [[Danny White]], twice caught such a pass for a touchdown. It was noted at the time that he was only eligible because of the shotgun formation (an NFL quarterback who takes a snap from underneath the center was and still is an ineligible receiver, a rule not found in any amateur level of American football). \n\nThe shotgun is also used in college, but running is used more often than in the NFL. Most offenses in college who run in the shotgun have a fast quarterback. They often use a play where the quarterback has an option of handing the ball off to the running back who runs to the side opposite the side he was lined up on. The quarterback can also run the opposite way depending on how the defense reacts. [[Urban Meyer]] and the [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] used this effectively from 2006 to 2009 with [[Tim Tebow]].\n\n==Related formations==\n\nThe [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] currently employs a formation called the \"[[pistol offense|pistol]]\", in which the running back, instead of lining up next to the quarterback, lines up behind the quarterback, who in turn has lined up two to three yards behind the center.\n\nCoach [[Urban Meyer]] has added elements of the [[option offense]] to the shotgun offense he employed as coach at [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green State University]], the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]], and [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]].

Instead of the [[quarterback]] receiving the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] at the [[line of scrimmage]], in the shotgun he stands farther back, often five to seven yards off the line. Sometimes the quarterback will have a back on one or both sides before the snap, while other times he will be the lone player in the backfield with everyone spread out as receivers. \n\nThe shotgun formation can offer certain advantages. The offensive linemen have more room to maneuver behind the scrimmage line and form a tighter, more cohesive oval \u201cpocket\u201d in which the quarterback is protected from \u201cblitzing\u201d by the defense.  If the quarterback has speed, mobility or both, he can use this formation to scramble before his pass; or, to run to an open field position in the defensive secondary or to the sideline, usually gaining first-down yardage.  \n\nAlthough some running plays can be run effectively from the shotgun, the formation also has weaknesses. The defense knows a pass is more than likely coming, particularly from an empty set lacking any running backs, and there is a higher risk of a botched snap than in a simple center/quarterback exchange.  If the defense is planning a pass rush, this formation gives fast defensive players more open and exposed targets in the offensive backfield, with less cluttered \u201cblitzing\u201d routes to the quarterback and any other [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] in the offensive backfield.\n\nShotgun combines elements of the [[short punt formation|short punt]] and spread formations \u2014 \"spread\" in that it has receivers spread widely instead of close to or behind the interior line players. The origins of the term are thought to be that it is like a \"shotgun\" in spraying receivers around the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1184750-25-craziest-football-terms-and-where-they-come-from|title=BleacherReport, Craziest Football Terms and Where They Come From}}</ref> (The alignment of the players also suggests the shape of an actual shotgun.)

The bulbs are ovoid, with whitish large and pointed scales and can reach about {{convert|1.5|cm}} of diameter. The stem is erect, the leaves are lanceolate, up to 10 centimeters long. The inflorescence has one to five short-haired flowers. They are hermaphroditic and scentless, have six upright [[tepal]]s, the outer are slightly narrower than the inner ones. The flowers can reach 4\u20136 centimeters in length and are bright yellow-orange with reddish-brown dots. The [[stamen]]s are erect, about half as long as the [[tepal]]s, with red [[anther]]s. The style is orange, {{convert|35|mm}} of height. The flowering period extends from May through July.<ref>Pignatti S. - Flora d'Italia - Edagricole \u2013 1982 Vol. III. pa. 362</ref>\n\nThere are two varieties, ''L. b.'' var. ''croceum'' <small>(Chaix) Baker</small> in the western part of the range, and ''L. b.'' var. ''bulbiferum'' in its eastern part. Only the last one always produces secondary aerial bulbs (''bulbils'') in the axils of the upper leaves.  These ''bulbils'' fall to the ground and mature after two to three years. When manually separated from the stem they can easily used for propagating the plant.\n\nThe dwarf plants from the [[Maritime Alps]], formerly described as var. ''chaixii'' <small>(Elwes) Stoker</small>, and the large plants from the region of [[Naples]], formerly described as var. ''giganteum'' <small>N. Terracc.</small>, are now considered as local variants of var. ''croceum''.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''L. bulbiferum'' is widely distributed in much of Europe from Spain to Finland and [[Ukraine]].<ref name=yu>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index1.php?scientific-name=lilium+bulbiferum Altervista Flora Italiana, Giglio rosso, Orange Lily, ''Lilium bulbiferum'' L.] includes many photos plus European distribution map</ref> It grows in mountain meadows and on hillsides.

A teacher fresh out of training. He was allocated Class 5C, the most unruly form in the \nschool, at the beginning of term. At first relations were frosty between Bernard and Class 5C, but gradually Bernard gained the respect \nof his class and the rest of the staff. As the series progressed, he is shown to be a caring and very fair teacher and would always defend \nhis form, regardless of how much evidence is put towards them.\n\nIn the movie, he met air stewardess Penny Wheeler. After misinterpreting a 'few white lies' made by a pupil accidentally left behind, Penny   \nbegan to take shine to Bernard. After a period of dating, Bernard attempted to propose to Penny but she already said yes before he could complete his sentence and they got engaged and later married.\n\nShortly after Bernard got married, a new term started and was allocated Class 4C but it was not quite the same as 5C. He later resigned and left.\n\n'''Mr Norman Potter''' (Portrayed by [[Deryck Guyler]]). The pedantic and officious school caretaker. He claimed to have been a Desert Rat and constantly complains about the unruly behaviour of Hedge's class 5C. He is fiercely loyal (to the point of sycophancy) to the headmaster but a thorn in the side of the rest of the staff. His various comeuppances provide much of the ongoing humour of the sitcom.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of films based on British sitcoms]]\n* [[Welcome Back, Kotter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|please_sir|Please Sir!''

A teacher fresh out of training. He was allocated Class 5C, the most unruly form in the \nschool, at the beginning of term. At first relations were frosty between Bernard and Class 5C, but gradually Bernard gained the respect \nof his class and the rest of the staff. As the series progressed, he is shown to be a caring and very fair teacher and would always defend \nhis form, regardless of how much evidence is put towards them.\n\nIn the movie, he met air stewardess Penny Wheeler. After misinterpreting a 'few white lies' made by a pupil accidentally left behind, Penny   \nbegan to take shine to Bernard. After a period of dating, Bernard attempted to propose to Penny but she already said yes before he could complete his sentence and they got engaged and later married.\n\nShortly after Bernard got married, a new term started and was allocated Class 4C but it was not quite the same as 5C. He later resigned and left.\n\n'''Mr Norman Potter''' (Portrayed by [[Deryck Guyler]]). The pedantic and officious school caretaker. He claimed to have been a Desert Rat and constantly complains about the unruly behaviour of Hedge's class 5C. He is fiercely loyal (to the point of sycophancy) to the headmaster but a thorn in the side of the rest of the staff. His various comeuppances provide much of the ongoing humour of the sitcom.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of films based on British sitcoms]]\n* [[Welcome Back, Kotter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|please_sir|Please Sir!''

At the beginning of the last century, Naumann was a leading German liberal thinker and politician. He resolutely backed the idea of civic [[education]].

It also enjoys close links with Germany\u2019s Free Democratic Party (FDP) and [[Liberal International]] (LI).\n\nWhile the Foundation\u2019s activities in the field of civic education consist of seminars, conferences and publications aimed at promoting liberal values and principles, the international political dialogue program provides a discussion forum for a wide range of liberal issues. The Foundation\u2019s counselling programs focus on candidates for political office, liberal political parties and other democratic organizations.\n\nThe Friedrich Naumann Foundation, together with other foundations of different philosophical, political and ideological orientation and the non-political [[Studienstiftung|German National Academic Foundation]], acts as an instrument for the promotion of excellence in German university education.
