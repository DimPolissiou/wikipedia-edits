''NME''. April 21, 1984.</ref> is the second studio album by [[R.E.M.]] Released on April 9, 1984 by [[I.R.S. Records]]. Produced by [[Mitch Easter]] and [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]], the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used [[binaural recording]] on several tracks. Lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is a recurring theme on the album. Released to critical acclaim, ''Reckoning'' reached number 27 in the United States\u2014where it was [[RIAA certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1991\u2014and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Background and production==\n[[File:Mitch michael scott.jpg|left|alt=Mitch Easter sitting at a mixing board next to two musicians|thumb|Mitch Easter (far left, pictured in 1986 producing [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]]'s ''[[Lolita Nation]]'') and Don Dixon helped shape R.E.M.'s sound through ''Reckoning'']] \nAfter their debut album ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983) received critical acclaim, R.E.M. quickly began working on their second album. They wrote new material prodigiously; lead guitarist [[Peter Buck]] recalled, \"We were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We just wanted to do it; whenever we had a new batch of songs, it was time to record\".<ref name=\"Fletcher100\">Fletcher, p. 100</ref> Because of the many new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried convincing everyone to make the next album a double album.<ref name=\"BOB87\">The Notorious Stuart Brothers. \"A Date With Peter Buck\". ''[[Bucketfull of Brains]]''. December 1987.</ref> In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with [[Neil Young]] producer [[Elliot Mazer]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>Fletcher, p. 99</ref> While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with ''Murmur'' producers [[Mitch Easter]] and [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]] instead.<ref name=\"Fletcher100\" />\n\nR.E.M. started recording ''Reckoning'' at Reflection Sound in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on December 8, 1983.<ref>Black, p. 90</ref> The group recorded over two eight-day stretches around Christmas that year, separated by two weeks of canceled studio time that allowed the band to perform in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], go see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio.<ref>Black, p. 91</ref><ref>Fletcher, p. 100\u201301</ref> While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews, Buck sometimes stated that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that they were at the studio for over 25 days \u2014 during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said \"When I read 'eleven days' I thought, what the fuck! It was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven.\"<ref name=\"Fletcher101\">Fletcher, p. 101</ref>\n\nDuring recording, there was pressure from I.R.S. Records to try making the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg \"record company clueless\", while Easter said \"I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage.\" Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that \"it got to the point where as much as [he] respected the guys at I.R.S., [they] basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know [they] were recording them!\", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.<ref>Buckley, p. 99</ref>\n\nThe recording sessions were difficult for lead singer [[Michael Stipe]], who, among the band, was particularly worn out by the band's 1983 tour schedule. Getting usable vocal tracks from Stipe was difficult; Dixon recalled that he and Stipe would show up around noon each day before the rest of the band, but that \"he was kind of shut down, and it was difficult to get him to open up\". While recording the song \"7 Chinese Brothers\", Stipe sang so quietly that Dixon could not hear him on the tape. Frustrated, the producer climbed a ladder to a spot above the recording booth Stipe was in and found a gospel record titled ''The Joy of Knowing Jesus'' by the Revelaires, which he then handed to the singer in an attempt to inspire him. Stipe began reciting the liner notes from the album audibly, which enabled Dixon to move on to recording the vocal track to \"7 Chinese Brothers\" properly<ref>Buckley, p. 99\u2013100</ref> (the initial recitation take was later released in 1987 as \"Voice of Harold\" on the compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]'').<ref>Black, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{listen|filename=R.E.M. - Harborcoat.ogg|title=\"Harborcoat\" |description=Opening track \"Harborcoat\" includes the vocal interplay between Mills and Stipe as well as frenetic drumming from Berry and Buck's chiming guitar.}}\nWith ''Reckoning'', Dixon, Easter, and the band wanted to capture the energy of R.E.M.'s live sound.<ref>Buckley, p. 100</ref> Dixon had not seen the band perform live before working on ''Murmur''; after he had done so, he had a greater sense of the band's strengths and weaknesses. Dixon wanted the guitars to sound more like they did in concert, but originally they met resistance from both the band and the label; however, by the time R.E.M. started recording, Dixon said the group \"wanted to rock out a bit more\".<ref>Buckley, p. 101</ref>\n\nDixon was enamored of the [[binaural recording]] technique, and used it extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon \"made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it\" to record the group. In Easter's opinion the method made drummer [[Bill Berry]]'s parts \"fresher sounding\". Binaural recording also allowed bassist [[Mike Mills]]' backing vocals to be loud without obscuring Stipe's lead vocals. Dixon explained, \"Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 feet away from the microphones that were recording his part, but because it was in a studio binaural field, we would tend to hear him as behind [Stipe].\"<ref>Buckley, p. 100\u201301</ref>\n\nBiographer David Buckley wrote, \"While the music moved away from ''Murmur'''s slightly airless feel, the subject matter was a little darker.\"<ref name=\"Buckley102\">Buckley, p. 102</ref> Buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in the album.<ref>Halbersberg, Elianne. \"Peter Buck of R.E.M.\" ''East Coast Rocker''. November 30, 1988.</ref> Buckley interpreted that imagery as representing the change presented by the band's increasing success, as well as the changing music scene of the group's [[Athens, Georgia]] hometown.<ref name=\"Buckley102\" /> The song \"Camera\" addressed the death of a friend from Athens who died in a car crash.<ref>Buckley, p. 103</ref> Easter said, \"[Stipe's] vocal was so exposed on that track, and because of that, it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch.\" The producer tried to get Stipe to sing a better take, but the singer was more intent on getting the feeling of the song across, and at one point refused to record further.<ref>Buckley, p. 104</ref> While many of the album's songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.'s show setlists for years. Particular, the songs \"Pretty Persuasion\" and \"(Don't Go Back to) Rockville\" had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record \"Pretty Persuasion\", as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so.<ref>Buckley, p. 111</ref> R.E.M. initially planned releasing \"(Don't Go Back to) Rockville\" as a non-album single between ''Reckoning'' and its next release.<ref name=\"BOB87\" /> When the band recorded it for the album, the group rearranged the song from its live incarnation and gave it a [[country music]]-like influence as tribute to its lawyer [[Bertis Downs, IV]], who was a fan of country music.<ref>Buckley, p. 111\u201312</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nFor the cover of ''Reckoning'', Stipe drew a picture of a two-headed snake, which he then gave to artist [[Howard Finster]] to fill in as a painting. Stipe stated that the imagery was an attempt to define the elements, explaining, \"Part of it is rocks and part of it is the sun and part of it the sky.\" The end result was considered a disappointment, as Stipe had to work with Finster on a long-distance basis, and the reproduction of the artwork for the album sleeve was problematic.<ref name=\"Fletcher106\">Fletcher, p. 106</ref> The spine of the vinyl version of the album features the phrase \"File Under Water\". Stipe told ''[[NME]]'' in 1984 the phrase is the true title of the record. He added \"In America, both titles are on the spine, with nothing on the cover. Here [in the United Kingdom] they insisted on ''Reckoning'' being on the cover.\"<ref name=\"Hoskyns, Barney 1984\"/> Instead of labeling the sides of the record as \"side one\" and \"side two\", the sides were designated as \"L\" and \"R\", respectively.<ref>Black, p. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nThe back cover features a photograph of Stipe taken by Michael Plen at the club Bains-Douches in [[Paris]], France, on November 24, 1983.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/B5QNhIaF0Ei/ R.E.M.'s official Instagram feed]</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reckoning-mw0000191497 |title=''Reckoning'' \u2013 R.E.M. |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-24/entertainment/9101260490_1_star-irs-rem |title=Traveling Through The Years With R.E.M. |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=March 24, 1991 |accessdate=November 2, 2015 |last=Kot |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Kot}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = B+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2916 |chapter=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' |accessdate=August 31, 2015 |title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s]] |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |year=1990 |isbn=0-679-73015-X}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/03/22/rem-discography |title=An R.E.M. discography |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 22, 1991 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/31/rem-reckoning-review |title=REM: ''Reckoning'' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 31, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Hann |first=Michael}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score = 10/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13130-reckoning-deluxe-edition/ |title=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' [Deluxe Edition] |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=LeMay |first=Matt}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=278 |date=September 2009 |page=118}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev8Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Connelly\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reckoning-20010502 |title=''Reckoning'' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=April 9, 1984 |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |last=Connelly |first=Christopher}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev9Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=R.E.M. |last=Nawrocki |first=Tom |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/685 685\u201387] |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 }}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev10Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/rem-reckoning-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition |title=REM \u2013 ''Reckoning'' (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition) |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Torn |first=Luke}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Reckoning'' was released on April 9, 1984 in the United Kingdom and on April 17 in the United States.<ref name=\"Black94\">Black, p. 94</ref> The album quickly reached number one on the [[Campus radio|college radio]] airplay charts, whose audience had highly anticipated the album; however, the band hadn't received much exposure on commercial radio and [[MTV]] by that point.

However, Connelly felt that Stipe's \"erratic meanderings\" were an impediment to the band that \"will prevent R.E.M. from transcending cult status\". Nonetheless, he concluded, \"R.E.M.'s music is able to involve the listener on both an emotional and intellectual level.\"<ref name=\"Connelly\"/> Joe Sasfy of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt that the songs on the album \"trump even ''Murmur''{{'}}s outstanding songwriting\" and stated \"there isn't an American band worth following more than R.E.M.\"<ref name=\"Sasfy\">Sasfy, Joe. \"Reckoning With R.E.M.\" ''The Washington Post''.

Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist [[Reuben Aaron Miller|R.A. Miller]]'s Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker [[James Herbert (director)|James Herbert]] to direct it.<ref>Fletcher, p. 105</ref> In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed ''Left of Reckoning'' at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia.<ref name=\"Black94\" /> The short film draws its title from the fact that it is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the \"L\" side of the vinyl version of ''Reckoning'': \"Harborcoat\", \"7 Chinese Bros.\", \"So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)\", \"Pretty Persuasion\", \"Time After Time (AnnElise)\", in addition to \"Second Guessing\" from the R side.<ref>Black, p. 95</ref> In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage.<ref name=\"Black94\" /> Herbert utilized [[rephotography]] during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative.<ref name=\"Fletcher106\" /> According to Buck, \"It was really inexpensive to make and kind of fun. We just asked [Herbert] to edit something to four minutes' length, but he's used to making 20-minute films, that's the length he works in. He just made this film that goes along with the first side of the record.\" While MTV did not air the complete film, the channel's program ''[[I.R.S.

''NME''. April 21, 1984.</ref> is the second studio album by [[R.E.M.]] Released on April 9, 1984 by [[I.R.S. Records]]. It was produced by [[Mitch Easter]] and [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]], the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used [[binaural recording]] on several tracks. Lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is a recurring theme on the album. Released to critical acclaim, ''Reckoning'' reached number 27 in the United States\u2014where it was [[RIAA certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1991\u2014and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Background and production==\n[[File:Mitch michael scott.jpg|left|alt=Mitch Easter sitting at a mixing board next to two musicians|thumb|Mitch Easter (far left, pictured in 1986 producing [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]]'s ''[[Lolita Nation]]'') and Don Dixon helped shape R.E.M.'s sound through ''Reckoning'']] \nAfter their debut album ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983) received critical acclaim, R.E.M. quickly began working on their second album. They wrote new material prodigiously; lead guitarist [[Peter Buck]] recalled, \"We were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We just wanted to do it; whenever we had a new batch of songs, it was time to record\".<ref name=\"Fletcher100\">Fletcher, p. 100</ref> Because of the many new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried convincing everyone to make the next album a double album.<ref name=\"BOB87\">The Notorious Stuart Brothers. \"A Date With Peter Buck\". ''[[Bucketfull of Brains]]''. December 1987.</ref> In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with [[Neil Young]] producer [[Elliot Mazer]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>Fletcher, p. 99</ref> While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with ''Murmur'' producers [[Mitch Easter]] and [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]] instead.<ref name=\"Fletcher100\" />\n\nR.E.M. started recording ''Reckoning'' at Reflection Sound in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on December 8, 1983.<ref>Black, p. 90</ref> The group recorded over two eight-day stretches around Christmas that year, separated by two weeks of canceled studio time that allowed the band to perform in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], go see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio.<ref>Black, p. 91</ref><ref>Fletcher, p. 100\u201301</ref> While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews, Buck sometimes stated that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that they were at the studio for over 25 days \u2014 during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said \"When I read 'eleven days' I thought, what the fuck! It was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven.\"<ref name=\"Fletcher101\">Fletcher, p. 101</ref>\n\nDuring recording, there was pressure from I.R.S. Records to try making the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg \"record company clueless\", while Easter said \"I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage.\" Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that \"it got to the point where as much as [he] respected the guys at I.R.S., [they] basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know [they] were recording them!\", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.<ref>Buckley, p. 99</ref>\n\nThe recording sessions were difficult for lead singer [[Michael Stipe]], who, among the band, was particularly worn out by the band's 1983 tour schedule. Getting usable vocal tracks from Stipe was difficult; Dixon recalled that he and Stipe would show up around noon each day before the rest of the band, but that \"he was kind of shut down, and it was difficult to get him to open up\". While recording the song \"7 Chinese Brothers\", Stipe sang so quietly that Dixon could not hear him on the tape. Frustrated, the producer climbed a ladder to a spot above the recording booth Stipe was in and found a gospel record titled ''The Joy of Knowing Jesus'' by the Revelaires, which he then handed to the singer in an attempt to inspire him. Stipe began reciting the liner notes from the album audibly, which enabled Dixon to move on to recording the vocal track to \"7 Chinese Brothers\" properly<ref>Buckley, p. 99\u2013100</ref> (the initial recitation take was later released in 1987 as \"Voice of Harold\" on the compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]'').<ref>Black, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{listen|filename=R.E.M. - Harborcoat.ogg|title=\"Harborcoat\" |description=Opening track \"Harborcoat\" includes the vocal interplay between Mills and Stipe as well as frenetic drumming from Berry and Buck's chiming guitar.}}\nWith ''Reckoning'', Dixon, Easter, and the band wanted to capture the energy of R.E.M.'s live sound.<ref>Buckley, p. 100</ref> Dixon had not seen the band perform live before working on ''Murmur''; after he had done so, he had a greater sense of the band's strengths and weaknesses. Dixon wanted the guitars to sound more like they did in concert, but originally they met resistance from both the band and the label; however, by the time R.E.M. started recording, Dixon said the group \"wanted to rock out a bit more\".<ref>Buckley, p. 101</ref>\n\nDixon was enamored of the [[binaural recording]] technique, and used it extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon \"made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it\" to record the group. In Easter's opinion the method made drummer [[Bill Berry]]'s parts \"fresher sounding\". Binaural recording also allowed bassist [[Mike Mills]]' backing vocals to be loud without obscuring Stipe's lead vocals. Dixon explained, \"Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 feet away from the microphones that were recording his part, but because it was in a studio binaural field, we would tend to hear him as behind [Stipe].\"<ref>Buckley, p. 100\u201301</ref>\n\nBiographer David Buckley wrote, \"While the music moved away from ''Murmur'''s slightly airless feel, the subject matter was a little darker.\"<ref name=\"Buckley102\">Buckley, p. 102</ref> Buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in the album.<ref>Halbersberg, Elianne. \"Peter Buck of R.E.M.\" ''East Coast Rocker''. November 30, 1988.</ref> Buckley interpreted that imagery as representing the change presented by the band's increasing success, as well as the changing music scene of the group's [[Athens, Georgia]] hometown.<ref name=\"Buckley102\" /> The song \"Camera\" addressed the death of a friend from Athens who died in a car crash.<ref>Buckley, p. 103</ref> Easter said, \"[Stipe's] vocal was so exposed on that track, and because of that, it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch.\" The producer tried to get Stipe to sing a better take, but the singer was more intent on getting the feeling of the song across, and at one point refused to record further.<ref>Buckley, p. 104</ref> While many of the album's songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.'s show setlists for years. Particular, the songs \"Pretty Persuasion\" and \"(Don't Go Back to) Rockville\" had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record \"Pretty Persuasion\", as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so.<ref>Buckley, p. 111</ref> R.E.M. initially planned releasing \"(Don't Go Back to) Rockville\" as a non-album single between ''Reckoning'' and its next release.<ref name=\"BOB87\" /> When the band recorded it for the album, the group rearranged the song from its live incarnation and gave it a [[country music]]-like influence as tribute to its lawyer [[Bertis Downs, IV]], who was a fan of country music.<ref>Buckley, p. 111\u201312</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nFor the cover of ''Reckoning'', Stipe drew a picture of a two-headed snake, which he then gave to artist [[Howard Finster]] to fill in as a painting. Stipe stated that the imagery was an attempt to define the elements, explaining, \"Part of it is rocks and part of it is the sun and part of it the sky.\" The end result was considered a disappointment, as Stipe had to work with Finster on a long-distance basis, and the reproduction of the artwork for the album sleeve was problematic.<ref name=\"Fletcher106\">Fletcher, p. 106</ref> The spine of the vinyl version of the album features the phrase \"File Under Water\". Stipe told ''[[NME]]'' in 1984 the phrase is the true title of the record. He added \"In America, both titles are on the spine, with nothing on the cover. Here [in the United Kingdom] they insisted on ''Reckoning'' being on the cover.\"<ref name=\"Hoskyns, Barney 1984\"/> Instead of labeling the sides of the record as \"side one\" and \"side two\", the sides were designated as \"L\" and \"R\", respectively.<ref>Black, p. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nThe back cover features a photograph of Stipe taken by Michael Plen at the club Bains-Douches in [[Paris]], France, on November 24, 1983.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/B5QNhIaF0Ei/ R.E.M.'s official Instagram feed]</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reckoning-mw0000191497 |title=''Reckoning'' \u2013 R.E.M. |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-24/entertainment/9101260490_1_star-irs-rem |title=Traveling Through The Years With R.E.M. |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=March 24, 1991 |accessdate=November 2, 2015 |last=Kot |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Kot}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = B+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2916 |chapter=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' |accessdate=August 31, 2015 |title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s]] |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |year=1990 |isbn=0-679-73015-X}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/03/22/rem-discography |title=An R.E.M. discography |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 22, 1991 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/31/rem-reckoning-review |title=REM: ''Reckoning'' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 31, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Hann |first=Michael}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score = 10/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13130-reckoning-deluxe-edition/ |title=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' [Deluxe Edition] |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=LeMay |first=Matt}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=R.E.M.: ''Reckoning'' |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=278 |date=September 2009 |page=118}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev8Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Connelly\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reckoning-20010502 |title=''Reckoning'' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=April 9, 1984 |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |last=Connelly |first=Christopher}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev9Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=R.E.M. |last=Nawrocki |first=Tom |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/685 685\u201387] |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 }}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev10Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/rem-reckoning-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition |title=REM \u2013 ''Reckoning'' (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition) |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |last=Torn |first=Luke}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Reckoning'' was released on April 9, 1984 in the United Kingdom and on April 17 in the United States.<ref name=\"Black94\">Black, p. 94</ref> The album quickly reached number one on the [[Campus radio|college radio]] airplay charts, whose audience had highly anticipated the album; however, the band hadn't received much exposure on commercial radio and [[MTV]] by that point. Instead of the music industry standard of waiting for mainstream radio stations to pick up the band's music, I.R.S. hoped to \"convince reluctant programmers to add the group by pointing to the press response, word-of-mouth reaction to local live performances and sales figures\", according to a July 1984 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article.<ref>Snowden, Don. \"The Reckoning of R.E.M.\" ''Los Angeles Times''.

Reviewer Christopher Connelly wrote that in comparison to ''Murmur'' the \"overall sound is crisper, the lyrics far more comprehensible.

However, Connelly felt that Stipe's \"erratic meanderings\" were an impediment to the band that \"will prevent R.E.M. from transcending cult status\". Nonetheless, he concluded, \"R.E.M.'s music is able to involve the listener on both an emotional and intellectual level.\"<ref name=\"Connelly\"/> Joe Sasfy of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt that the songs on the album \"trump even ''Murmur''{{'}}s outstanding songwriting\" and stated \"there isn't an American band worth following more than R.E.M.\"<ref name=\"Sasfy\">Sasfy, Joe. \"Reckoning With R.E.M.\" ''The Washington Post''.

Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist [[Reuben Aaron Miller|R.A. Miller]]'s Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker [[James Herbert (director)|James Herbert]] to direct it.<ref>Fletcher, p. 105</ref> In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed ''Left of Reckoning'' at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia.<ref name=\"Black94\" /> The short film draws its title from the fact that it is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the \"L\" side of the vinyl version of ''Reckoning'': \"Harborcoat\", \"7 Chinese Bros.\", \"So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)\", \"Pretty Persuasion\", \"Time After Time (AnnElise)\", in addition to \"Second Guessing\" from the R side.<ref>Black, p. 95</ref> In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage.<ref name=\"Black94\" /> Herbert utilized [[rephotography]] during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative.<ref name=\"Fletcher106\" /> According to Buck, \"It was really inexpensive to make and kind of fun. We just asked [Herbert] to edit something to four minutes' length, but he's used to making 20-minute films, that's the length he works in. He just made this film that goes along with the first side of the record.\" While MTV did not air the complete film, the channel's program ''[[I.R.S.

In the foreground, slaves are drowning in the water, while others are being eaten by large fish\n|caption=''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840) [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s representation of the mass killing of slaves, inspired by the ''Zong'' killings<ref>Burroughs 2010, p. 106.</ref>\n|date=29 November 1781\n|perpetrators=British slavers\n|victims=African slaves\n}}\nThe '''''Zong'' massacre''' was the mass killing of more than 130&nbsp;African [[Slavery|slaves]] by the crew of the British [[slave ship]] ''Zong'' on and in the days following 29 November 1781.{{Efn|The exact number of deaths is unknown but James Kelsall (''Zong''{{'s}} first mate) later said that \"the outside number of drowned amounted to 142 in the whole\" (quoted in Lewis (2007; p. 364).}} The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in [[Liverpool]], owned the ship and sailed her in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. According to the crew, when the ship ran low on drinking water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea.\n\nAfter the slave ship reached port at [[Black River, Jamaica]], ''Zong''{{'}}s owners made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (''Gregson v Gilbert'' (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The jury found for the slavers, but at a subsequent appeal hearing the judges, led by [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield]], ruled against the syndicate owners, due to new evidence that suggested the captain and crew were at fault.\n\nFollowing the first trial, freed slave [[Olaudah Equiano]] brought news of the massacre to the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner [[Granville Sharp]], who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the ''Zong'' events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the [[Middle Passage]] of slaves to the [[New World]].<ref name=\"usi\"/>\n\nThe non-denominational [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was founded in 1787. The next year [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]], its first law regulating the slave trade, to limit the number of slaves per ship. Then, in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners when slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was remembered in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which abolished British participation in the African slave trade, though not slavery itself. A monument to the murdered slaves on ''Zong'' was installed at Black River Jamaica.\n\n==''Zong''==\n{{Slavery}}\n''Zong'' was originally named ''Zorg'' (meaning \"Care\" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) by its owners, the [[Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie]]. It operated as a slave ship based in [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]], and made a voyage in 1777, delivering slaves to the coast of [[Suriname]], South America.<ref name=\"Webster 2007, p. 288\">Webster 2007, p. 288.</ref> ''Zong'' was a \"square stern ship\" of 110&nbsp;[[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]].<ref name=Lewis365>Lewis 2007, p. 365.</ref> The [[United Kingdom|British]] 16-gun brig {{HMS|Alert|1779|6}} captured her on 10 February 1781. On 26 February, ''Alert'' and ''Zong'' arrived at [[Cape Coast Castle]], in what is present-day [[Ghana]]. Cape Coast Castle was maintained and staffed, along with other forts and castles, by the [[Royal African Company]] (RAC),<ref>Lewis 2007, p. 359.</ref> which used the Castle as its regional headquarters.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387.</ref>\n\nIn early March 1781, the master of ''William'' purchased ''Zong'' on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants.<ref name=\"Lewis 360\">Lewis 2007, p. 360.</ref> The members of the syndicate were: Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall and William, James, and John Gregson.<ref name=\"Walvin 217\">Walvin 2011, p. 217.</ref> William Gregson had an interest in 50&nbsp;slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780; he also served as [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool|mayor of Liverpool]] in 1762.<ref name=\"Lewis 358\">Lewis 2007, p. 358.</ref> By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,000 Africans to slavery in the Americas.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 57.</ref>\n\n''Zong'' was paid for with [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], and the 244&nbsp;slaves already on board were part of the transaction.<ref name=\"Lewis 360\"/> The ship was not insured until after it started its voyage.<ref name=Lewis361>Lewis 2007, p. 361.</ref> The insurers, a syndicate from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and slaves for up to \u00a38,000, approximately half the slaves' potential market value. The remaining risk was borne by the owners.<ref name=Lewis361 /><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Crew===\n''Zong'' was the first command of Luke Collingwood, formerly the surgeon on the ''William''.<ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 358, 360.</ref> While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command, ship's surgeons were typically involved in selecting slaves for purchase in Africa, so their medical expertise supported the determination of \"commodity value\" for a captive.<ref name=\"Krikler 2012, p. 409\">Krikler 2012, p. 409.</ref> If the surgeon rejected a captive, that individual suffered \"commercial death\", being of no value, and was liable to be killed by African handlers.<ref name=\"Krikler 2012, p. 409\"/> Sometimes these killings happened in the presence of the surgeon. It is likely that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass-killing of slaves. As the historian Jeremy Krikler commented, this may have prepared him psychologically to condone the massacre that took place on the ''Zong''.<ref name=\"Krikler 2012, p. 409\"/><ref>Krikler 2007, p. 31.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 52.</ref><!--This seems an odd statement, as Krikler seems to suggest Collingwood did not participate at all, as he was ill, according to statements below.--> ''Zong''{{'s}} first mate was James Kelsall, who had also served on the ''William''.<ref name=\"Lewis 358\"/>\n\nThe vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was a former captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was appointed by the African Committee of the Royal African Company as the governor of [[Fort William, Ghana|Anomabu]], a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana.<ref name=\"Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387\">Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387.</ref> This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle.<ref name=\"Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387\"/> Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was forced out of the governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months.<ref name=\"Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387\"/><ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 359\u2013360.</ref> Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.<ref name=\"Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387\"/>\n\n''Zong'' had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, which was far too small to maintain adequate sanitary conditions on the ship.<ref name=\"Krikler 411\">Krikler 2012, p. 411.</ref> Mariners willing to risk disease and slave rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain and were harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch off the coast of Africa.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 45\u201348, 69.</ref> ''Zong'' was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew, the crew of ''William'', and with unemployed sailors hired from the settlements along the African coast.<ref name=Lewis361/>\n\n== The Middle Passage ==\nWhen ''Zong'' sailed from [[Accra]] with 442&nbsp;slaves on 18 August 1781, it had taken on more than twice the number of people that it could safely transport.<ref name=Lewis361 /> In the 1780s, British-built ships typically carried 1.75&nbsp;slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the ''Zong'', the ratio was 4.0 per ton.<ref>Webster 2007, p. 289.</ref> A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193&nbsp;slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of ''Zong''{{'s}} relatively small size to carry so many.<ref name=\"Walvin 27\"/>\n\nAfter taking on drinking water at [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], ''Zong'' began its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to [[Jamaica]] on 6 September. On 18&nbsp;or 19 November, the ship neared [[Tobago]] in the Caribbean but failed to stop there to replenish its water supplies.<ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 362\u2013363.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear who, if anyone, was in charge of the ship at this point,<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 90.</ref> as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time.<ref name=\"Walvin 87\">Walvin 2011, p. 87.</ref> The man who would normally have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14 November.<ref name=\"Walvin 87\"/> Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded ''Zong'' during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 77, 88.</ref> According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n\n=== Massacre ===\n\n[[File:Zong Massacre map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=Map of the Caribbean, showing Tobago, Hispaniola and Jamaica |Map of the Caribbean, showing [[Tobago]], [[Hispaniola]] (red) and [[Jamaica]] (blue)]]\nOn 27&nbsp;or 28 November, the crew sighted Jamaica at a distance of {{convert|27|nmi|km mi}} but misidentified it as the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]].<ref name=\"Lewis 363\">Lewis 2007, p. 363.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 92.</ref> ''Zong'' continued on its westward course, leaving Jamaica behind.

Similarly, if the slaves died a \"natural death\" (as the contemporary term put it) at sea, then insurance could not be claimed. If some slaves were jettisoned in order to save the rest of the \"cargo\" or the ship, then a claim could be made under \"[[general average]]\".<ref>Webster 2007, p. 291.</ref> (This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers.) The ship's insurance covered the loss of slaves at \u00a330&nbsp;a head.<ref name=Weisbord562>Weisbord 1969, p. 562.</ref>\n\nOn 29 November, the crew assembled to consider the proposal that some of the slaves should be thrown overboard.<ref name=\"Walvin 97\">Walvin 2011, p. 97.</ref> James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed.<ref name=Weisbord562 /><ref name=\"Walvin 97\"/> On 29 November 54&nbsp;women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea.<ref name=Lewis364>Lewis 2007, p. 364.</ref> On 1 December 42&nbsp;male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36&nbsp;more followed in the next few days.<ref name=Lewis364 /> Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea.<ref name=Lewis364 /> Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one of the captives requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 98, 157\u2013158.</ref> In total, 142 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached Jamaica. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.<ref name=\"Rupprecht 268\"/>\n\nThe crew claimed that the slaves had been jettisoned because the ship did not have enough water to keep all the slaves alive for the rest of the voyage. This claim was later disputed, as the ship had {{convert|420|impgal|l}} of water left when it arrived in Jamaica on 22 December.<ref name=Weisbord562 /> An [[affidavit]] later made by Kelsall stated that on 1 December, when 42 slaves were killed, it rained heavily for more than a day, allowing six casks of water (sufficient for 11 days) to be collected.<ref name=Weisbord562 /><ref>Lewis 2007, p. 366.</ref>\n\n=== Arrival at Jamaica ===\nOn 22 December 1781, ''Zong'' arrived at [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]], Jamaica with 208&nbsp;slaves on board, less than half the number taken from Africa.<ref name=Lewis364 /> These sold for an average price of \u00a336 each.<ref name=Lewis365 /> The Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court upheld the legality of the Britich capture of ''Zong'' from the Duch, and the syndicate renamd the ship ''Richard of Jamaica''.<ref name=Lewis365 /> Luke Collingwood died three days after ''Zong'' reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.<ref name=\"Webster 2007, p. 288\"/>\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\n\n[[File:William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, wearing his parliamentary robes|[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]] by [[John Singleton Copley]], in his [[Privilege of peerage#Parliament robes|parliamentary robes]] as an Earl<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04197 |title=''William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield'', by John Singleton Copley |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>]]\nWhen the news of ''Zong''{{'s}} voyage reached Great Britain, the ship's owners claimed compensation from their insurers for the loss of the slaves.

This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 36\u201338.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 155.</ref> One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain.<ref>Oldham 2007, pp. 313\u2013314.</ref> Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by ''Zong''{{'s}} crew.<ref name=Krikler38/>\n\nThere is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue.<ref>Krikler 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref>Weisbord 1969, p. 564.</ref> Despite Granville Sharp's efforts, no member of the crew was prosecuted for murder of the slaves.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 167.</ref>  Yet, the ''Zong'' case did eventually gain both national and international attention. A summary of the appeal on the ''Zong'' case, was eventually published in the [[nominate reports]] prepared from the contemporaneous manuscript notes of [[Sylvester Douglas, 1st Baron Glenbervie|Sylvester Douglas, Baron Glenbervie]], and others.

For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 32\u201333, 36\u201338, 42.</ref> The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial, while leaving the notion of \"general average\" intact. He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners' insurance claim would have been valid, if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain.<ref name=Krikler38>Krikler 2007, p. 38.</ref>\n\nKrikler comments that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], that the killing of innocents in the name of self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea.<ref name=\"Krikler 2007 39\"/> Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle\u2014that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\n== Effect on the abolitionist movement ==\n[[File:African woman slave trade.jpg|thumb|alt=A cartoon image of the crew of a slave ship lashing a female slave.

In April 1783, he sent an account of the massacre to [[William Dillwyn]], a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The [[Britain Yearly Meeting|London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends]] decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273&nbsp;Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783.<ref>Rupprecht, \"A Very Uncommon Case\" (2007), pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThe immediate effect of the ''Zong'' massacre on public opinion was limited, demonstrating\u2014as the historian of abolitionism [[Seymour Drescher]] has noted\u2014the challenge that the early abolitionists faced.<ref name=\"Drescher 575\u20136\">Drescher 2012, pp. 575\u2013576.</ref> Following Sharp's efforts, the ''Zong'' massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature and the massacre was discussed in works by [[Thomas Clarkson (abolitionist)|Thomas Clarkson]], [[Ottobah Cugoano]], [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|James Ramsay]] and [[John Newton]].<ref>Lovejoy 2006, p. 337.</ref><ref>Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483\u2013484.</ref> These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain, thereby creating, in the words of Srividhya Swaminathan, \"a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage\".<ref name =\"Swaminathan 484\">Swaminathan 2010, p. 484.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, \"Excessive Memories\" (2007), p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe ''Zong'' killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade, stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.<ref name=\"Swaminathan 2010, p. 485\"/><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 176\u2013179.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, \"A Very Uncommon Case\" (2007), pp. 330\u2013331.</ref> In 1787, the [[Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was founded.<ref name=\"usi\"/>\n\nParliament received numerous petitions against the slave trade and examined the issue in 1788. With strong support by [[Sir William Dolben, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Dolben]], who had toured a slave ship, it passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]] (Dolben's Act), which was its first legislation to regulate the slave trade. It restricted the number of slaves that could be transported, to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation. Its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited the scope of insurance policies concerning slaves, rendering illegal such generalised phrases that promised to insure against \"all other Perils, Losses, and Misfortunes.\" (The ''Zong'' owners' representatives had highlighted such a phrase in seeking their claim at the King's Bench hearing.)<ref>Oldham 2007, pp. 302, 313.</ref> The act had to be renewed annually and Dolben led these efforts, speaking frequently to parliament in opposition to slavery.<ref>Nigel Aston, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7780 \"Dolben, Sir William, third baronet (1727\u20131814)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> The Slave Trade Act of 1799 was passed to make these provisions permanent.\n\nAbolitionists, notably [[William Wilberforce]], continued their effort to end the slave trade. Britain passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the [[Blockade of Africa]]. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.\n\nIn 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in Britain, dedicated to abolishing slavery throughout the [[British Empire]]; the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] represented the achievement of their goal. The ''Zong'' massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his ''History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade'', which included an account of killings.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"Boime 36\">Boime 1990, p. 36.</ref>\n\nClarkson's book had an important influence on the artist [[J. M. W. Turner]], who displayed a painting at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1840 entitled ''[[The Slave Ship]]''. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the [[Legcuffs|shackles]] worn by the slaves, appear to have been influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book.<ref name=\"Boime 36\"/> The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 6.</ref><ref>Boime 1990, p. 34.</ref> The painting was admired by its owner, [[John Ruskin]]. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.<ref>Wood 2000, p. 41.</ref>\n\n== Representations in modern culture ==\n\n[[File:Slave ship tower bridge 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A sailing ship sits moored on the River Thames, with a large bridge in the background|''[[Kaskelot (tall ship)|Kaskelot]]'', appearing as ''Zong'', at [[Tower Bridge]] during commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007]]\nThe ''Zong'' massacre has inspired several works of literature. [[Fred D'Aguiar]]'s novel ''[[Feeding the Ghosts]]'' (1997) tells the story of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the ''Zong''. In the novel, the journal of the slave\u2014Mintah\u2014is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.<ref name=\"Rupprecht 268\">Rupprecht 2008, p. 268.</ref>\n\n[[M. NourbeSe Philip]]'s 2008 book of poems, ''Zong!'', is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its primary material.

As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. According to the crew, when the ship ran low on drinking water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea.\n\nAfter the slave ship reached port at [[Black River, Jamaica]], ''Zong''{{'}}s owners made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (''Gregson v Gilbert'' (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The jury found for the slavers, but at a subsequent appeal hearing the judges, led by [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield]], ruled against the syndicate owners, due to new evidence that suggested the captain and crew were at fault.\n\nFollowing the first trial, freed slave [[Olaudah Equiano]] brought news of the massacre to the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner [[Granville Sharp]], who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the ''Zong'' events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the [[Middle Passage]] of slaves to the [[New World]].<ref name=\"usi\"/>\n\nThe non-denominational [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was founded in 1787. The next year [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]], its first law regulating the slave trade, to limit the number of slaves per ship. Then, in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners when slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was remembered in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which abolished British participation in the African slave trade, though not slavery itself. A monument to the murdered slaves on ''Zong'' was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.<ref name=\"usi\">[http://www.understandingslavery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=373&Itemid=236 \"The Zong case study\"], Understanding Slavery Initiative website, 2011.</ref>\n\n==''Zong''==\n{{Slavery}}\n''Zong'' was originally named ''Zorg'' (meaning \"Care\" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) by its owners, the [[Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie]].

On 26 February, ''Alert'' and ''Zong'' arrived at [[Cape Coast Castle]], in what is present-day [[Ghana]]. Cape Coast Castle was maintained and staffed, along with other forts and castles, by the [[Royal African Company]] (RAC),<ref>Lewis 2007, p. 359.</ref> which used the Castle as its regional headquarters.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 76\u201387.</ref>\n\nIn early March 1781, the master of ''William'' purchased ''Zong'' on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants.<ref name=\"Lewis 360\">Lewis 2007, p. 360.</ref> The members of the syndicate were: Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall and William, James, and John Gregson.<ref name=\"Walvin 217\">Walvin 2011, p. 217.</ref> William Gregson had an interest in 50&nbsp;slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780; he also served as [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool|mayor of Liverpool]] in 1762.<ref name=\"Lewis 358\">Lewis 2007, p. 358.</ref> By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,000 Africans to slavery in the Americas.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 57.</ref>\n\n''Zong'' was paid for with [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], and the 244&nbsp;slaves already on board were part of the transaction.<ref name=\"Lewis 360\"/> The ship was not insured until after it started its voyage.<ref name=Lewis361>Lewis 2007, p. 361.</ref> The insurers, a syndicate from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and slaves for up to \u00a38,000, approximately half the slaves' potential market value.

Similarly, if the slaves died a \"natural death\" (as the contemporary term put it) at sea, then insurance could not be claimed. If some slaves were jettisoned in order to save the rest of the \"cargo\" or the ship, then a claim could be made under \"[[general average]]\".<ref>Webster 2007, p. 291.</ref> (This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers.)

This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 36\u201338.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 155.</ref> One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain.<ref>Oldham 2007, pp. 313\u2013314.</ref> Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by ''Zong''{{'s}} crew.<ref name=Krikler38/>\n\nThere is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue.<ref>Krikler 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref>Weisbord 1969, p. 564.</ref> Despite Granville Sharp's efforts, no member of the crew was prosecuted for murder of the slaves.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 167.</ref>  Yet, the ''Zong'' case did eventually gain both national and international attention. A summary of the appeal on the ''Zong'' case, was eventually published in the [[nominate reports]] prepared from the contemporaneous manuscript notes of [[Sylvester Douglas, 1st Baron Glenbervie|Sylvester Douglas, Baron Glenbervie]], and others.

For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 32\u201333, 36\u201338, 42.</ref> The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial, while leaving the notion of \"general average\" intact. He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners' insurance claim would have been valid, if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain.<ref name=Krikler38>Krikler 2007, p. 38.</ref>\n\nKrikler comments that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], that the killing of innocents in the name of self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea.<ref name=\"Krikler 2007 39\"/> Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle\u2014that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\n== Effect on the abolitionist movement ==\n[[File:African woman slave trade.jpg|thumb|alt=A cartoon image of the crew of a slave ship lashing a female slave.

In April 1783, he sent an account of the massacre to [[William Dillwyn]], a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The [[Britain Yearly Meeting|London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends]] decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273&nbsp;Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783.<ref>Rupprecht, \"A Very Uncommon Case\" (2007), pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThe immediate effect of the ''Zong'' massacre on public opinion was limited, demonstrating\u2014as the historian of abolitionism [[Seymour Drescher]] has noted\u2014the challenge that the early abolitionists faced.<ref name=\"Drescher 575\u20136\">Drescher 2012, pp. 575\u2013576.</ref> Following Sharp's efforts, the ''Zong'' massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature and the massacre was discussed in works by [[Thomas Clarkson (abolitionist)|Thomas Clarkson]], [[Ottobah Cugoano]], [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|James Ramsay]] and [[John Newton]].<ref>Lovejoy 2006, p. 337.</ref><ref>Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483\u2013484.</ref> These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain, thereby creating, in the words of Srividhya Swaminathan, \"a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage\".<ref name =\"Swaminathan 484\">Swaminathan 2010, p. 484.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, \"Excessive Memories\" (2007), p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe ''Zong'' killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade, stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.<ref name=\"Swaminathan 2010, p. 485\"/><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 176\u2013179.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, \"A Very Uncommon Case\" (2007), pp. 330\u2013331.</ref> In 1787, the [[Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was founded.<ref name=\"usi\"/>\n\nParliament received numerous petitions against the slave trade and examined the issue in 1788. With strong support by [[Sir William Dolben, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Dolben]], who had toured a slave ship, it passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]] (Dolben's Act), which was its first legislation to regulate the slave trade. It restricted the number of slaves that could be transported, to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation. Its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited the scope of insurance policies concerning slaves, rendering illegal such generalised phrases that promised to insure against \"all other Perils, Losses, and Misfortunes.\" (The ''Zong'' owners' representatives had highlighted such a phrase in seeking their claim at the King's Bench hearing.)<ref>Oldham 2007, pp. 302, 313.</ref> The act had to be renewed annually and Dolben led these efforts, speaking frequently to parliament in opposition to slavery.<ref>Nigel Aston, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7780 \"Dolben, Sir William, third baronet (1727\u20131814)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> The Slave Trade Act of 1799 was passed to make these provisions permanent.\n\nAbolitionists, notably [[William Wilberforce]], continued their effort to end the slave trade. Britain passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the [[Blockade of Africa]]. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.\n\nIn 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in Britain, dedicated to abolishing slavery throughout the [[British Empire]]; the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] represented the achievement of their goal. The ''Zong'' massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his ''History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade'', which included an account of killings.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"Boime 36\">Boime 1990, p. 36.</ref>\n\nClarkson's book had an important influence on the artist [[J. M. W. Turner]], who displayed a painting at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1840 entitled ''[[The Slave Ship]]''. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the [[Legcuffs|shackles]] worn by the slaves, appear to have been influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book.<ref name=\"Boime 36\"/> The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 6.</ref><ref>Boime 1990, p. 34.</ref> The painting was admired by its owner, [[John Ruskin]]. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.<ref>Wood 2000, p. 41.</ref>\n\n== Representations in modern culture ==\n\n[[File:Slave ship tower bridge 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A sailing ship sits moored on the River Thames, with a large bridge in the background|''[[Kaskelot (tall ship)|Kaskelot]]'', appearing as ''Zong'', at [[Tower Bridge]] during commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007]]\nThe ''Zong'' massacre has inspired several works of literature. [[Fred D'Aguiar]]'s novel ''[[Feeding the Ghosts]]'' (1997) tells the story of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the ''Zong''. In the novel, the journal of the slave\u2014Mintah\u2014is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.<ref name=\"Rupprecht 268\">Rupprecht 2008, p. 268.</ref>\n\n[[M. NourbeSe Philip]]'s 2008 book of poems, ''Zong!'', is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its primary material. Philip's text physically deconstructs the account as a method for undermining the document's authority.<ref name=\"Rupprecht 268\"/>\n\n[[Margaret Busby]]'s play ''An African Cargo'', staged by Nitro theatre company at [[Greenwich Theatre]] in 2007, dealt with the massacre and the 1783 trials, making use of the legal transcripts.<ref>Felix Cross, [http://www.nitro.co.uk/news/felixs-blog/belle-an-unexpected-journey/ \"Belle: An Unexpected Journey\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417232523/http://www.nitro.co.uk/news/felixs-blog/belle-an-unexpected-journey/ |date=17 April 2015 }}, Nitro, 13 June 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk/explore/productions/african-cargo |title=Black Plays Archive |publisher=The National Theatre |accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn episode of the television programme ''[[Garrow's Law]]'' (2010) is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w5c5g |title=Garrow's Law |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> The historical [[William Garrow]] did not take part in the case, and because the ''Zong''{{'s}} captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/nov/12/garrows-law-court-dramas|title= TV & Radio Blog: Law draws from real-life court dramas|author= Mark Pallis|date=12 November 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nA new play, ''The Meaning of Zong'', being developed by [[Giles Terera]], also deals with the massacre and the 1783 trials.

It is the only [[system of measurement]] with an official status in nearly every country in the world. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] starting with seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[second]] (the unit of [[time]] with the symbol s), [[metre]] ([[length]], m), [[kilogram]] ([[mass]], kg), [[ampere]] ([[electric current]], A), [[kelvin]] ([[thermodynamic temperature]], K), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ([[amount of substance]], mol), and [[candela]] ([[luminous intensity]], cd). The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called [[SI derived unit|derived units]], which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units.<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the SI unit of [[velocity]] is the metre per second, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]] is the metre per second squared, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> Twenty-two derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]]. The volt per metre is equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22123</sup>\u22c5A<sup>\u22121</sup> when expressed in terms of base units.</ref> which are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI system also provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of [[measurement]] progresses and the precision of measurements improves. \n\nSince 2019, the magnitudes of all SI units have been defined by declaring exact numerical values for seven ''defining constants'' when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]] {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, the [[Planck constant]] {{Math|''h''}}, the [[elementary charge]] {{Math|''e''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Avogadro constant]] {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, and the [[luminous efficacy]] {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. One consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.\n\nThe current way of defining the SI system is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit.  One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology. The last artefact used by the SI was the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]].\n \nThe original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe International System of Units, the SI,<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\">{{SIbrochure9th}}</ref>{{rp|123|quote=\u2026 since its establishment in 1960, the International System of Units has always been referred to as \u2018the SI\u2019 in its shortened form.}} is a decimal{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Meaning that different units for a given quantity, such as length, are related by factors of 10.

When that prefactor is one, the unit is called a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|''coherent'']] derived unit.<ref group=\"Note\">Here are some examples of coherent derived SI units: of [[velocity]], the [[metre per second]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]], the [[metre per second squared]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> The base and coherent derived units of the SI together form a coherent system of units called ''the set of coherent SI units''.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|A useful property of a coherent system is that when the numerical values of physical quantities are expressed in terms of the units of the system, then the equations between the numerical values have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the physical quantities;<ref name=\"ISO8000-1\">{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30669|title=ISO 80000-1:2009 Quantities and units \u2014 Part 1: General}}</ref>{{rp|6}} An example may be useful to clarify this.

The earliest ones were introduced in French in 1795, at the institution of the metric system, and include ''milli-'' (1/1000), ''centi-'' (1/100), ''deci-'' (1/10), ''deca-'' (10), ''hecto-'' (100) and ''kilo-'' (1000).

So, driving distances are normally given not in metres but in [[kilometre]]s (symbol {{val|u=km}}). Here the prefix '[[kilo-]]' (symbol 'k') stands for a factor of 1000; thus, one kilometre ({{val|1|u=km}}) is {{val|1000|u=m}}. On the other hand, [[tailor|tailor's]] measurements are more conveniently expressed in [[centimetre]]s (symbol {{val|u=cm}}); the prefix '[[centi-]]' (symbol 'c') stands for a factor of 1/100={{val|0.01}}, so that one centimetre ({{val|1|u=cm}}) is {{val|0.01|u=m}}. \n\nThe grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The only limitation is that the unit symbol must be either a symbol for one of the seven base units or for one of the 22 derived units with special names and symbols.}} (e.g. '{{val|u=km}}', '{{val|u=cm}}') constitutes a new inseparable unit symbol.

For example, the joule per kelvin is the coherent SI unit for two distinct quantities: [[heat capacity]] and [[entropy]].

For example, one of these defining constants is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, which in the SI by definition has the exact value of {{Math|''c''}} = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}. The other six are <math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math>,  the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]]; {{Math|''h''}}, the [[Planck constant]]; {{Math|''e''}}, the [[elementary charge]]; {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]]; {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, the [[Avogadro constant]]; and {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}, the [[luminous efficacy]] of monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540e12|u=Hz}}.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|{{nowrap|Their exactly defined values are as follows:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math> {{=}} {{val|9192631770|u=Hz}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>c</math> {{=}} {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>h</math> {{=}} {{val|6.62607015e-34|u=J.s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>e</math> {{=}} {{val|1.602176634e-19|u=C}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>k</math> {{=}} {{val|1.380649e-23|u=J/K}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>N_{\\text{A}}</math> {{=}} {{val|6.02214076e23|u=mol-1}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>K_{\\text{cd}}</math> {{=}} {{val|683|u=lm/W}}.}}}} \n\nEach defining constant can be taken as defining the magnitude of that defining constant's unit of measurement;<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}} for example, the definition of {{Math|''c''}} defines the unit {{val|u=m/s}} as {{val|1|u=m/s}} = {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}}. In this way, the defining constants directly define the [[hertz]] ({{val|u=Hz}}), [[metre per second]] ({{val|u=m/s}}), [[joule-second]] ({{val|u=J.s}}), [[coulomb]] ({{val|u=C}}), [[Joule per Kelvin|joule per kelvin]] ({{val|u=J/K}}), the inverse [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|u=mol-1}}), and [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] per [[watt]] ({{val|u=lm/W}}).  Further, one can show, using [[dimensional analysis]], that every coherent SI unit (whether base or derived) can be written as a unique product of powers of the units of the defining constants. Therefore, purely ''mathematically'' speaking, the SI units are defined ''as if'' we declared that it is the defining constant's units that are now the base units, with all other SI units being derived units. For example, since {{sfrac|{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{val|9192631770}}}} = {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}} = {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}|{{val|6.62607015e-34}}}} = {{val|1|u=J.s}}, the three defining constants {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, {{math|''c''}}, and {{math|''h''}} define the kilogram because, on the one hand, they respectively define the units {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, and {{val|u=J.s}}, while, on the other hand, the kilogram can be written in terms of these three units, namely, {{nowrap|1={{val|1|u=kg}} = ({{val|1|u=Hz}})({{val|1|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|1|u=J.s}}).}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|To see this, recall that {{nowrap|{{val|u=Hz}} {{=}} {{val|u=s-1}}}} and {{nowrap|{{val|u=J}} {{=}} {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}.}} Thus {{nowrap|({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) {{=}} ({{val|u=s-1}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}) {{=}} {{val|u=kg}},}} since all the powers of metres and seconds cancel out. It can further be shown that ({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) is the ''only'' combination of powers of the units of the defining constants (that is, the only combination of powers of {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, {{val|u=J.s}}, {{val|u=C}}, {{val|u=J/K}}, {{val|u=mol-1}}, and {{val|u=lm/W}}) that results in the kilogram.}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI Brochure prefers to write the relationship between the kilogram and the defining constants directly, without going through the intermediary step of defining {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{val|1|u=J.s}}, like this:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|131}} {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=kg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|({{val|299792458}}){{sup|2}}|({{val|6.62607015e-34}})({{val|9192631770}})}}{{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}&thinsp;{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{math|''c''}}{{sup|2}}}}.}}}} \n\nThe nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128\u20139}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. \n\nOne consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.

The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n=={{anchor|Coherent SI units}} Units and prefixes==\nThe International System of Units consists of a set of [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as [[SI prefix|prefix]]es.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|103\u2013106}} The units, excluding prefixed units,<ref group=\"Note\">For historical reasons, the kilogram rather than the gram is treated as the coherent unit, making an exception to this characterisation.</ref> form a [[coherent system of units]], which is based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent units have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities.

All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|122}}<ref name=\"NIST811\">{{cite book |author-first1=Ambler |author-last1=Thompson |author-first2=Barry N. |author-last2=Taylor |date=2008 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf |title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 811) |location=Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}</ref>{{rp|14}} When prefixes are used to form multiples and submultiples of SI base and derived units, the resulting units are no longer coherent.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|7}}\n\nThe BIPM specifies 20 prefixes for the International System of Units (SI):\n\n:{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\n===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===\n{{Main|Non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}\nMany non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature.

This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (\u00b0,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.\n* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.\n* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, \u03bc in \u03bcg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to (km)<sup>2</sup>).\n* Unit symbols are written using roman (upright) type, regardless of the type used in the surrounding text.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (\u22c5) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N\u22c5m or N&nbsp;m.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the \"metre per second\" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) and kg\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.\n[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|In the expression of acceleration due to gravity, a space separates the value and the units, both the 'm' and the 's' are lowercase because neither the metre nor the second are named after people, and exponentiation is represented with a [[superscript]] '2'.]]\n* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written \"Pa\", but the symbol for mole is written \"mol\". Thus, \"T\" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and \"t\" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase \"L\" or a lowercase \"l\", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter \"l\" to the numeral \"1\", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States \"L\" be used rather than \"l\".\n* Symbols do not have a plural form, e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, but not 25&nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.\n* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).\n* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=March\u2013April 2008 |title=Period or Comma?

Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.\n\nThe 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/ |title=Resolution 7 of the 9th meeting of the CGPM (1948): Writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers |access-date=2012-11-06 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref> These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used, and how the values of quantities should be expressed.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|104,130}}\n\n===Birth of the SI===\nIn 1960, the 11th CGPM synthesised the results of the 12-year study into a set of 16 resolutions.

[[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) were added later.\n\nThe early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' \u00d7 ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ <big>SI base units</big><ref name=\"NIST330\"/>{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"BIPM1975\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page |pages=[https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page/page/238 238]\u2013244 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875\u20131975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page |editor-first1=Chester H. |editor-last2=Vigoureux |editor-first2=Paul |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref>\n|-\n!Unit<br />name\n!Definition<ref group=\"n\">Interim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition.</ref> \n|-\n![[second]]\n|\n*'''Prior''': (1675) {{sfrac|1|{{val|86400}}}} of a day of 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds.<sup>TLB</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1956): {{sfrac|{{val|31556925.9747}}}} of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].\n*'''Current''' (1967): The duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium-133]] atom.\n|-\n![[metre]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): {{sfrac|{{val|10000000}}}} of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The Prototype of the metre chosen by the CIPM, at the temperature of melting ice, represents the metric unit of length.\n*'''Interim''' (1960): {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s in a [[vacuum]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between the 2p{{sup|10}} and 5d{{sup|5}} quantum levels of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]].\n*'''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second.\n|-\n![[kilogram]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): The '''[[grave (unit)|grave]]''' was defined as being the mass (then called ''weight'') of one litre of pure water at its freezing point.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The mass of a small squat cylinder of \u224847 cubic centimetres of platinum-iridium alloy kept in the Pavillon de Breteuil{{citation needed|reason=Though this is the location of the BIPM in Saint-Cloud, https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-introduction indicates that [...] the IPK, which is kept by the [BIPM] in S\u00e8vres, France.

It is the only [[system of measurement]] with an official status in nearly every country in the world. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] starting with seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[second]] (the unit of [[time]] with the symbol s), [[metre]] ([[length]], m), [[kilogram]] ([[mass]], kg), [[ampere]] ([[electric current]], A), [[kelvin]] ([[thermodynamic temperature]], K), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ([[amount of substance]], mol), and [[candela]] ([[luminous intensity]], cd). The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called [[SI derived unit|derived units]], which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units.<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the SI unit of [[velocity]] is the metre per second, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]] is the metre per second squared, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> Twenty-two derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]]. The volt per metre is equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22123</sup>\u22c5A<sup>\u22121</sup> when expressed in terms of base units.</ref> which are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI system also provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of [[measurement]] progresses and the precision of measurements improves. \n\nSince 2019, the magnitudes of all SI units have been defined by declaring exact numerical values for seven ''defining constants'' when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]] {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, the [[Planck constant]] {{Math|''h''}}, the [[elementary charge]] {{Math|''e''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Avogadro constant]] {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, and the [[luminous efficacy]] {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. One consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.\n\nThe current way of defining the SI system is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit.  One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology. The last artefact used by the SI was the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]].\n \nThe original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe International System of Units, the SI,<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\">{{SIbrochure9th}}</ref>{{rp|123|quote=\u2026 since its establishment in 1960, the International System of Units has always been referred to as \u2018the SI\u2019 in its shortened form.}} is a decimal{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Meaning that different units for a given quantity, such as length, are related by factors of 10.

When that prefactor is one, the unit is called a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|''coherent'']] derived unit.<ref group=\"Note\">Here are some examples of coherent derived SI units: of [[velocity]], the [[metre per second]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]], the [[metre per second squared]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> The base and coherent derived units of the SI together form a coherent system of units called ''the set of coherent SI units''.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|A useful property of a coherent system is that when the numerical values of physical quantities are expressed in terms of the units of the system, then the equations between the numerical values have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the physical quantities;<ref name=\"ISO8000-1\">{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30669|title=ISO 80000-1:2009 Quantities and units \u2014 Part 1: General}}</ref>{{rp|6}} An example may be useful to clarify this. Suppose we are given an equation relating some [[Physical quantity|physical quantities]], e.g. <math>T=\\frac{1}{2}\\,m\\,v^{2}</math>, expressing the [[kinetic energy]] <math>T</math> in terms of the mass <math>m</math> and the velocity <math>v</math>.

For example, the following is not a coherent system: one where energy is measured in [[calories]], while mass and velocity are measured in their SI units. After all, in that case, <math>\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\{m\\}\\,\\{v\\}^{2}</math> will give a numerical value whose meaning is the kinetic energy when expressed in joules, and that numerical value is different, by a factor of {{val|4.184}}, from the numerical value when the kinetic energy is expressed in calories. Thus, in that system, the equation satisfied by the numerical values is instead <math>\\{T\\}=\\frac{1}{4.184}\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\{m\\}\\,\\{v\\}^{2}</math>.}} Twenty-two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> when written in terms of the base units; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equal to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]].

Namely, the SI provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units, ranging from 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Many of the prefixes predate the creation of the SI. The earliest ones were introduced in French in 1795, at the institution of the metric system, and include ''milli-'' (1/1000), ''centi-'' (1/100), ''deci-'' (1/10), ''deca-'' (10), ''hecto-'' (100) and ''kilo-'' (1000). In fact, ''milli-'' and ''centi-'', at least, had appeared in scientific literature in 1793.<ref name=\"OEDmilli\">{{Cite OED|milli|id=118531}}</ref><ref name=\"OEDcenti\">{{Cite OED|centi|id=29650}}</ref>}}\n\nFor example, while the coherent unit of length is the metre,{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI base units (like the metre) are also called ''coherent units'', because they belong to the ''set of coherent SI units''.}} the SI provides a full range of smaller and larger units of length, any of which may turn out to be more convenient for any given application. So, driving distances are normally given not in metres but in [[kilometre]]s (symbol {{val|u=km}}). Here the prefix '[[kilo-]]' (symbol 'k') stands for a factor of 1000; thus, one kilometre ({{val|1|u=km}}) is {{val|1000|u=m}}. On the other hand, [[tailor|tailor's]] measurements are more conveniently expressed in [[centimetre]]s (symbol {{val|u=cm}}); the prefix '[[centi-]]' (symbol 'c') stands for a factor of 1/100={{val|0.01}}, so that one centimetre ({{val|1|u=cm}}) is {{val|0.01|u=m}}. \n\nThe grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The only limitation is that the unit symbol must be either a symbol for one of the seven base units or for one of the 22 derived units with special names and symbols.}} (e.g. '{{val|u=km}}', '{{val|u=cm}}') constitutes a new inseparable unit symbol. This new symbol can be raised to a positive or negative power and can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit symbols.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|143}} For example, {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=km}}{{sup|2}}/{{val|u=s}}{{sup|2}} is an SI unit of enenrgy, where {{val|u=km}}{{sup|2}} should be interpreted as ({{val|u=km}}){{sup|2}}. \n\nAs a consequence of all this, the conversion of units within the SI is always through a power of ten;{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Note, however, that there is a special group of units that are called '[[Non-SI units accepted for use with SI|non-SI units that are accepted for use with the SI]]'.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|145}} Most of these, in order to be converted to the corresponding SI unit, require conversion factors that are not powers of ten.<br> Some common examples of such units are the customary units of time, namely the minute (conversion factor of 60, since 1 min {{=}} {{val|60|u=s}}), the hour ({{val|3600|u=s}}), and the day ({{val|86400|u=s}}); the degree (for measuring plane angles, {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=deg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|{{math|''\u03c0''}}|180}} {{val||u=rad}});}} and the [[electronvolt]] (a unit of energy, {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=eV}} {{=}} {{val|1.602176634e-19|u=J}}).}}}} this is why the SI system (and metric systems more generally) are called ''decimal systems of measurement units''.<ref name=\"DecimalSystem\">{{cite web |url=https://usma.org/decimal-nature-of-the-metric-system |title=Decimal Nature of the Metric System |publisher=[[US Metric Association]] |year=2015 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415225727/https://usma.org/decimal-nature-of-the-metric-system/ |archive-date=15 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Coherent and non-coherent SI units====\nWhen prefixes are used with the coherent SI units, the resulting units are no longer coherent, because the prefix introduces a numerical factor other than one.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|137}} The one exception is the kilogram, the only coherent SI unit whose name and symbol, for historical reasons, include a prefix.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Names and symbols for decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed as if it is the [[gram]] which is the base unit, i.e. by attaching prefix names and symbols, respectively, to the unit name \u201cgram\u201d and the unit symbol \u201cg\u201d.

The other six are <math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math>,  the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]]; {{Math|''h''}}, the [[Planck constant]]; {{Math|''e''}}, the [[elementary charge]]; {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]]; {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, the [[Avogadro constant]]; and {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}, the [[luminous efficacy]] of monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540e12|u=Hz}}.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|{{nowrap|Their exactly defined values are as follows:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math> {{=}} {{val|9192631770|u=Hz}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>c</math> {{=}} {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>h</math> {{=}} {{val|6.62607015e-34|u=J.s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>e</math> {{=}} {{val|1.602176634e-19|u=C}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>k</math> {{=}} {{val|1.380649e-23|u=J/K}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>N_{\\text{A}}</math> {{=}} {{val|6.02214076e23|u=mol-1}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>K_{\\text{cd}}</math> {{=}} {{val|683|u=lm/W}}.}}}} \n\nEach defining constant can be taken as defining the magnitude of that defining constant's unit of measurement;<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}} for example, the definition of {{Math|''c''}} defines the unit {{val|u=m/s}} as {{val|1|u=m/s}} = {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}}. In this way, the defining constants directly define the [[hertz]] ({{val|u=Hz}}), [[metre per second]] ({{val|u=m/s}}), [[joule-second]] ({{val|u=J.s}}), [[coulomb]] ({{val|u=C}}), [[Joule per Kelvin|joule per kelvin]] ({{val|u=J/K}}), the inverse [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|u=mol-1}}), and [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] per [[watt]] ({{val|u=lm/W}}).  Further, one can show, using [[dimensional analysis]], that every coherent SI unit (whether base or derived) can be written as a unique product of powers of the units of the defining constants. Therefore, purely ''mathematically'' speaking, the SI units are defined ''as if'' we declared that it is the defining constant's units that are now the base units, with all other SI units being derived units. For example, since {{sfrac|{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{val|9192631770}}}} = {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}} = {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}|{{val|6.62607015e-34}}}} = {{val|1|u=J.s}}, the three defining constants {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, {{math|''c''}}, and {{math|''h''}} define the kilogram because, on the one hand, they respectively define the units {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, and {{val|u=J.s}}, while, on the other hand, the kilogram can be written in terms of these three units, namely, {{nowrap|1={{val|1|u=kg}} = ({{val|1|u=Hz}})({{val|1|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|1|u=J.s}}).}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|To see this, recall that {{nowrap|{{val|u=Hz}} {{=}} {{val|u=s-1}}}} and {{nowrap|{{val|u=J}} {{=}} {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}.}} Thus {{nowrap|({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) {{=}} ({{val|u=s-1}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}) {{=}} {{val|u=kg}},}} since all the powers of metres and seconds cancel out. It can further be shown that ({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) is the ''only'' combination of powers of the units of the defining constants (that is, the only combination of powers of {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, {{val|u=J.s}}, {{val|u=C}}, {{val|u=J/K}}, {{val|u=mol-1}}, and {{val|u=lm/W}}) that results in the kilogram.}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI Brochure prefers to write the relationship between the kilogram and the defining constants directly, without going through the intermediary step of defining {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{val|1|u=J.s}}, like this:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|131}} {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=kg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|({{val|299792458}}){{sup|2}}|({{val|6.62607015e-34}})({{val|9192631770}})}}{{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}&thinsp;{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{math|''c''}}{{sup|2}}}}.}}}} \n\nThe nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128\u20139}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. \n\nOne consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants. Nevertheless, the distinction is retained because 'it is useful and historically well established', and also because the [[ISO/IEC 80000]] series of standards{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Which define the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ).}} specifies base and derived quantities that necessarily have the corresponding SI units.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n===Specifying fundamental constants vs. other methods of definition===\nThe current way of defining the SI system is the result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|126}} \n\nThe great advantage of doing it this way is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the units.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The sole exception is the definition of the second, which is still given not in terms of fixed values of fundamental constants but in terms of a particular property of a particular naturally occurring object, the caesium atom.

The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n=={{anchor|Coherent SI units}} Units and prefixes==\nThe International System of Units consists of a set of [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as [[SI prefix|prefix]]es.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|103\u2013106}} The units, excluding prefixed units,<ref group=\"Note\">For historical reasons, the kilogram rather than the gram is treated as the coherent unit, making an exception to this characterisation.</ref> form a [[coherent system of units]], which is based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent units have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities.

For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre.

This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (\u00b0,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.\n* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.\n* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, \u03bc in \u03bcg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to (km)<sup>2</sup>).\n* Unit symbols are written using roman (upright) type, regardless of the type used in the surrounding text.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (\u22c5) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N\u22c5m or N&nbsp;m.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the \"metre per second\" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) and kg\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.\n[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|In the expression of acceleration due to gravity, a space separates the value and the units, both the 'm' and the 's' are lowercase because neither the metre nor the second are named after people, and exponentiation is represented with a [[superscript]] '2'.]]\n* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written \"Pa\", but the symbol for mole is written \"mol\". Thus, \"T\" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and \"t\" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase \"L\" or a lowercase \"l\", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter \"l\" to the numeral \"1\", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States \"L\" be used rather than \"l\".\n* Symbols do not have a plural form, e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, but not 25&nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.\n* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).\n* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=March\u2013April 2008 |title=Period or Comma?

Where this is not possible, line breaks should coincide with thousands separators.\n* Because the value of \"billion\" and \"trillion\" [[Long and short scales|varies between languages]], the dimensionless terms \"ppb\" (parts per [[long and short scales|billion]]) and \"ppt\" (parts per [[long and short scales|trillion]]) should be avoided.

These are mostly additions to the list of named derived units, and include the ''[[Mole (unit)|mole]]'' (symbol mol) for an amount of substance, the ''[[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]'' (symbol Pa) for [[pressure]], the ''[[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]'' (symbol S) for electrical conductance, the ''[[becquerel]]'' (symbol Bq) for \"[[Radioactive decay|activity]] referred to a [[radionuclide]]\", the ''[[Gray (unit)|gray]]'' (symbol Gy) for ionising radiation, the ''[[sievert]]'' (symbol Sv) as the unit of dose equivalent radiation, and the ''[[katal]]'' (symbol kat) for [[catalytic activity]].<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|156}}<ref>p. 221 \u2013 McGreevy</ref><ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|156}}<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|158}}<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|159}}<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|165}}\n\nAcknowledging the advancement of precision science at both large and small scales, the range of defined prefixes pico- (10<sup>\u221212</sup>) to tera- (10<sup>12</sup>) was extended to 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|152}}<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|158}}<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\nThe 1960 definition of the standard metre in terms of wavelengths of a specific emission of the krypton 86 atom was replaced with the distance that light travels in a vacuum in exactly {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second, so that the speed of light is now an exactly specified constant of nature.\n\nA few changes to notation conventions have also been made to alleviate lexicographic ambiguities.

[[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) were added later.\n\nThe early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' \u00d7 ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ <big>SI base units</big><ref name=\"NIST330\"/>{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"BIPM1975\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page |pages=[https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page/page/238 238]\u2013244 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875\u20131975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page |editor-first1=Chester H. |editor-last2=Vigoureux |editor-first2=Paul |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref>\n|-\n!Unit<br />name\n!Definition<ref group=\"n\">Interim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition.</ref> \n|-\n![[second]]\n|\n*'''Prior''': (1675) {{sfrac|1|{{val|86400}}}} of a day of 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds.<sup>TLB</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1956): {{sfrac|{{val|31556925.9747}}}} of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].\n*'''Current''' (1967): The duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium-133]] atom.\n|-\n![[metre]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): {{sfrac|{{val|10000000}}}} of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The Prototype of the metre chosen by the CIPM, at the temperature of melting ice, represents the metric unit of length.\n*'''Interim''' (1960): {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s in a [[vacuum]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between the 2p{{sup|10}} and 5d{{sup|5}} quantum levels of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]].\n*'''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second.\n|-\n![[kilogram]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): The '''[[grave (unit)|grave]]''' was defined as being the mass (then called ''weight'') of one litre of pure water at its freezing point.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The mass of a small squat cylinder of \u224847 cubic centimetres of platinum-iridium alloy kept in the Pavillon de Breteuil{{citation needed|reason=Though this is the location of the BIPM in Saint-Cloud, https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-introduction indicates that [...] the IPK, which is kept by the [BIPM] in S\u00e8vres, France.

The reconstruction began in 1996 and was completed by support with bond issues and rigorous fund-raising by the San Marino Schools Endowment. The school is equipped with newer laboratories, classrooms, and ethernet connections. The new buildings include a brand new cafeteria, orchestra and band room, dance studio, journalism lab, and renovated auditoriums, as well as a renovated baseball field and a brand new football field/track.\n\nSan Marino High School is part of the [[San Marino Unified School District]].  Its public funding is supplemented by private donations raised through the San Marino Schools Foundation.\n\nSan Marino High School's upper football practice field was the location of where [[Kathy Fiscus]] fell into an abandoned water well in 1949.  It was subsequently capped and covered by the local water district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.myfoxla.com/blogs/Tony_Valdez/2008/03/31/Kathy_Fiscus_A_Fox_Flashback |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810235205/http://community.myfoxla.com/blogs/Tony_Valdez/2008/03/31/Kathy_Fiscus_A_Fox_Flashback |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Student population==\nAs of the 2008-09 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,096 students (276 seniors) and 59 classroom teachers (on an [[full-time equivalent|FTE]] basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 18.6.<ref name=NCES>[http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=0634860&ID=063486005886 San Marino High School], [[National Center for Education Statistics]].

SMHS offers a variety of AP Classes in mathematics (Calculus AB and BC, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Environmental Science), foreign languages (Spanish, Japanese (non-AP), Mandarin (non-AP)), English (Language and Literature), social science (Government), and music theory/art.\n\nExtracurricular classes include: the school newspaper ''Titan Shield'', the school yearbook ''Titanian'', Speech and Debate, Robotics, Indoor Winter Drumline, Winter Color Guard, Marching Band, Chamber Choir, Boys' and Girls' Choirs, orchestra, concert band, and wind ensemble, small business, [[fashion merchandising]], computer graphics, three courses in media arts (digital film making, animation, and field work), three levels of drama, stagecraft, and dance.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nSan Marino has a history of athletic rivalry with [[South Pasadena High School]], a neighboring city school.  Due to tradition, games against South Pasadena tend to have a larger crowd and hold more significance versus games against other schools.\n\nThe school's most recent title was CIF Co-Ed Varsity Badminton in Spring season of 2019. The D1 team's win was the first since Badminton was first introduced to the school. The time before that was Girls Golf Champions of Northern Division in November 2015 and Boys Football Champions of Central Division in December 2015. In 1998, the school won five straight [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] boys' tennis titles and was ranked number one in USA Today's High School Tennis Teams.\n\nIn April of 2018, the San Marino High School Winter Drumline advanced to the WGI world class division and ranked 14th in the nation.\n\nOn December 5, 2015, the football team won a [[California Interscholastic Federation]] Central Section title, defeating [[Charter Oak High School]] of Covina by the score of 45-28, then on December 12, 2015, they defeated [[Sierra Canyon School]] in the CIF State Southern California Regional Small School Division by the score of 36-35. On December 19, 2015, in the [[California Interscholastic Federation]] State Small School Open Division championship game, played at [[Sacramento State University]]'s Hornet Stadium against [[Central Catholic High School (Modesto, California)|Central Catholic High School]] of Modesto, they lost by the score of 56-21. They finished with a record of 15 wins against 1 loss.\n\n==School events==\nThe high school holds several events, including sports, theater, and others.  The Associated Student Body puts on the Coronation Ball, a dance held to crown the Homecoming Queen, King, and the Princesses, and Princes. They will then be honored throughout Homecoming. The ball is held on the Saturday directly before the Homecoming game takes place, in the home of a student, and also features an annual theme.
