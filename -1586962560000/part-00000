In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao).\n\nFr. Antonio Perez. founded Salasa (1714-1747)  In 1720, Poblacion was in Barangay Polong's Don Francisco Valencerina yard, later transferred later to Baranggay Salasa on January 24, 1734 by Fr. Fernando Garcia. The Plaza, Presedencia, the church and convent, were engineered by the Frayle (surrounded by parallel calles). Do\u00f1a Milagros Klar, wife of then manager of Pantranco ([[Philtranco]]) donated in 1935, the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] statue to Salasa Shrine.\n\nThe town was named after the town's hero Major [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] who fought together with Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] in 1899. February 5, 1899, at the [[Battle of La Loma]], Bugallon faced Gen. [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]]. Bugallon suffered a shot to the thigh during the battle. Later that day, in the arms of [[Antonio Luna]], Bugallon died from excessive loss of blood.<ref name=\"dioceseofalaminos.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dioceseofalaminos.org/parish-vicariateI-salasa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307063503/http://www.dioceseofalaminos.org/parish-vicariateI-salasa.htm |archivedate=2011-03-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the town of Salasa was renamed to Bugallon. Mr. Canullas founded the Jose Torres Bugallonas association and a monument was erected in the plaza, wherein the bones of General Bugallon were interred thereat on January 12, 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bugallon.net/aboutus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227071643/http://www.bugallon.net/aboutus |archivedate=2011-12-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe act of changing Salasa an old town to a new one, Bugallon, required a congressional approval sponsored by the Congressman Mauro Navarro, first district of Pangasinan, and obtained congressional approval in changing Salasa to Bugallon. Hence, Salasa became a mere barangay but remains the seat of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish (11 barangays) and the other is Bugallon's St. Andrew the Apostle (14 barangay).\n\n==Geography==\n===Barangays===\n\nBugallon is politically subdivided into 24 [[barangay]]s.<ref name=nscb>{{cite web|title=Province: PANGASINAN |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/province.asp?regName=REGION+I+%28Ilocos+Region%29&regCode=01&provCode=015500000&provName=PANGASINAN |work=PSGC Interactive |publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board |accessdate=26 November 2012 |location=Makati City, Philippines |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114165526/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/province.asp?regName=REGION+I+%28Ilocos+Region%29&regCode=01&provCode=015500000&provName=PANGASINAN |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* Angarian\n* Asinan\n* Ba\u00f1aga\n* Bacabac\n* Bolaoen\n* Buenlag\n* Cabayaoasan\n* Cayanga\n* Gueset\n* Hacienda\n* Laguit Centro\n* Laguit Padilla\n* Magtaking\n* Pangascasan\n* Pantal\n* Poblacion\n* Polong\n* Portic\n* Salasa\n* Salomague Norte\n* Salomague Sur\n* Samat\n* San Francisco\n* Umanday\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|location = Bugallon, Pangasinan\n|width=auto\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Feb high C = 31\n| Mar high C = 31\n| Apr high C = 32\n| May high C = 32\n| Jun high C = 32\n| Jul high C = 30\n| Aug high C = 30\n| Sep high C = 30\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 31\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Jan low C = 21\n| Feb low C = 21\n| Mar low C = 22\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 24\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 23\n| Aug low C = 23\n| Sep low C = 23\n| Oct low C = 23\n| Nov low C = 23\n| Dec low C = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 5.1 \n| Jan rain days = 3 \n| Feb precipitation mm = 11.6 \n| Feb rain days = 3\n| Mar precipitation mm = 21.1 \n| Mar rain days = 3 \n| Apr precipitation mm = 27.7 \n| Apr rain days = 4\n| May precipitation mm = 232.9\n| May rain days = 14    \n| Jun precipitation mm = 350.8 \n| Jun rain days = 18\n| Jul precipitation mm = 679.8\n| Jul rain days = 23\n| Aug precipitation mm = 733.1 \n| Aug rain days = 25\n| Sep precipitation mm = 505 \n| Sep rain days = 22\n| Oct precipitation mm = 176.6 \n| Oct rain days = 15\n| Nov precipitation mm = 67.2 \n| Nov rain days = 8\n| Dec precipitation mm = 17.7 \n| Dec rain days = 4\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Bugallon-weather-averages/Pangasinan/PH.aspx\n| title = Bugallon, Pangasinan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 26 September 2015}}</ref>\n| date=September 2015}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align=none\n| title = Population census of Bugallon\n| 1903 = 8746\n| 1918 = 10289\n| 1939 = 14469\n| 1948 = 18687\n| 1960 = 24698\n| 1970 = 31657\n| 1975 = 35981\n| 1980 = 39072\n| 1990 = 47412\n| 1995 = 50478\n| 2000 = 57445\n| 2007 = 62237\n| 2010 = 64253\n| 2015 = 67348\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Local government==\n\nBugallon's Chief Executives are Mayor Priscilla \u201cMely\u201d Ignacio Espino (wife of former governor Amado Espino) and Vice Mayor Winston P.

When the town site was transferred, the seat of the parish was also transferred as a consequence brought about by natural calamities that battered the area.\n\nThe 1914 Salasa floods destroyed crops, properties, buildings, the church and convent. Poblacion was transferred to Barangay Anagao (Bugallon), under Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Andrew the Apostle remained the patron Saint in July 1920 with 1st Parish Priest, Fr. Eustaquio Ocampo, then,  Fr. Montano Domingo on November 29, 1921 and on June 1928, Fr Emeterio Domagas succeeded.\n\nOn May 23, 1929, Pangasinan was created as a new Diocese and Msgr. Cesar Maria Guerrero became Pangasinan's First Bishop onn May 23, 1929. In 1930, Franciscan Capuchin appointed Fr. Cesario of Legario and Fr. Fernando of Erasum to Bugallon and Salasa, respectively on September 17, 1930. The Salasa Church, one of the biggest in Philippines, 100 meters long was completely destroyed and despoiled by Bugallon natives. Fr. Benjamin of Ilarduya became Kura Paroko from October 16, 1933 to June 27, 1941. The church brick-structure and the old fa\u00e7ade were built. During World War II,  Fr.

In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao).\n\nFr. Antonio Perez. founded Salasa (1714-1747)  In 1720, Poblacion was in Barangay Polong's Don Francisco Valencerina yard, later transferred later to Baranggay Salasa on January 24, 1734 by Fr. Fernando Garcia. The Plaza, Presedencia, the church and convent, were engineered by the Frayle (surrounded by parallel calles). Do\u00f1a Milagros Klar, wife of then manager of Pantranco ([[Philtranco]]) donated in 1935, the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] statue to Salasa Shrine.\n\nThe town was named after the town's hero Major [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] who fought together with Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] in 1899. February 5, 1899, at the [[Battle of La Loma]], Bugallon faced Gen. [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]]. Bugallon suffered a shot to the thigh during the battle. Later that day, in the arms of [[Antonio Luna]], Bugallon died from excessive loss of blood.<ref name=\"dioceseofalaminos.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dioceseofalaminos.org/parish-vicariateI-salasa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307063503/http://www.dioceseofalaminos.org/parish-vicariateI-salasa.htm |archivedate=2011-03-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the town of Salasa was renamed to Bugallon. Mr. Canullas founded the Jose Torres Bugallonas association and a monument was erected in the plaza, wherein the bones of General Bugallon were interred thereat on January 12, 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bugallon.net/aboutus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227071643/http://www.bugallon.net/aboutus |archivedate=2011-12-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe act of changing Salasa an old town to a new one, Bugallon, required a congressional approval sponsored by the Congressman Mauro Navarro, first district of Pangasinan, and obtained congressional approval in changing Salasa to Bugallon. Hence, Salasa became a mere barangay but remains the seat of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish (11 barangays) and the other is Bugallon's St. Andrew the Apostle (14 barangay).\n\n==Local government==\n\nBugallon's Chief Executives are Mayor Priscilla \u201cMely\u201d Ignacio Espino (wife of former governor Amado Espino) and Vice Mayor Winston P.

When the town site was transferred, the seat of the parish was also transferred as a consequence brought about by natural calamities that battered the area.\n\nThe 1914 Salasa floods destroyed crops, properties, buildings, the church and convent. Poblacion was transferred to Barangay Anagao (Bugallon), under Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Andrew the Apostle remained the patron Saint in July 1920 with 1st Parish Priest, Fr. Eustaquio Ocampo, then,  Fr. Montano Domingo on November 29, 1921 and on June 1928, Fr Emeterio Domagas succeeded.\n\nOn May 23, 1929, Pangasinan was created as a new Diocese and Msgr. Cesar Maria Guerrero became Pangasinan's First Bishop onn May 23, 1929. In 1930, Franciscan Capuchin appointed Fr. Cesario of Legario and Fr. Fernando of Erasum to Bugallon and Salasa, respectively on September 17, 1930. The Salasa Church, one of the biggest in Philippines, 100 meters long was completely destroyed and despoiled by Bugallon natives. Fr. Benjamin of Ilarduya became Kura Paroko from October 16, 1933 to June 27, 1941. The church brick-structure and the old fa\u00e7ade were built. During World War II,  Fr.

The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.\n\nAccordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.\n\n==Provident Fund==\nThe Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely 1.Cement 2. Cigarettes 3.Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products 4.Iron and Steel 5. Paper  6. Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act w.e.f 1, November,1952. The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of India]] under \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness & disablement and undeserved want. The EPF & MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:\n#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952\n#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976\n#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)\n\nRetirement fund body EPFO on 5 March 2020 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.50% for 2019-20,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epf-interest-rate-lowered-by-15-bps-to-8-5-for-fy20/articleshow/74489743.cms|title=EPFO Declares 8.50% interest Rate for 2019-20|last=|first=|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050747/https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> from 8.65%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/epf-interest-rate-lowered-by-to-8-5-per-cent-for-2019-20-1652679-2020-03-05|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.50 % for 2019-20 from 8.65% for 2018-19|last=|first=|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the previous fiscal.\n\n==Structure==\nThe EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the EPF & MP Act and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.\n\nThe Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.\n\nThe officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.\n\nAdministratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.\n\nThe total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.\n\n==Universal Account Number (UAN)==\n'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The UAN is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.\n\nThe Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. One can transfer balance from one EPF to his/her another EPF account with the help of UAN<ref>{{Cite news|last=Motiani|first=Preeti|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/how-to-transfer-your-epf-account-online/articleshow/71934423.cms?from=mdr|title=How to transfer your EPF account online|date=2020-01-13|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nThere are new UAN portal start to check your EPF balance and nowadays all the details like how to check UAN status,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=uan Registration & activation status procedure|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> download UAN EPF passbook,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epf-balance-and-epfo-balance/|title=3+ ways to know\u00a0your EPF Balance with uan & mobile|author=|date=30 September 2018|website=epfuanlogin.com}}</ref> check EPF balance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/transfer-pf-amount/|title=pf transfer withdrawal process -TDS|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> provident fund claim and many more facility provided by new UAN portal.\n\nEPFO has now started to provide the refund of Administrative charges if all the KYC details are updated for all employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=EPFO UAN Member portal Login registration features passbook etc - UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login|author=|date=|website=UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login}}</ref> This incentive program is announced for the Year 2016-2017.\n\nThe member who is unable to withdraw PF for any reason can withdraw without consent of employer.

The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.\n\nAccordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.\n\n==Provident Fund==\nThe Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely 1.Cement 2. Cigarettes 3.Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products 4.Iron and Steel 5. Paper  6. Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act w.e.f 1, November,1952. The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of India]] under \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness & disablement and undeserved want. The EPF & MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:\n#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952\n#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976\n#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)\n\nRetirement fund body EPFO on 5 March 2020 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.50% for 2019-20,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epf-interest-rate-lowered-by-15-bps-to-8-5-for-fy20/articleshow/74489743.cms|title=EPFO Declares 8.50% interest Rate for 2019-20|last=|first=|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050747/https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> from 8.65%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/epf-interest-rate-lowered-by-to-8-5-per-cent-for-2019-20-1652679-2020-03-05|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.50 % for 2019-20 from 8.65% for 2018-19|last=|first=|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the previous fiscal.\n\n==Structure==\nThe EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the EPF & MP Act and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.\n\nThe Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.\n\nThe officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.\n\nAdministratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.\n\nThe total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.\n\n==Universal Account Number (UAN)==\n'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The UAN is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.\n\nThe Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. One can transfer balance from one EPF to his/her another EPF account with the help of UAN<ref>{{Cite news|last=Motiani|first=Preeti|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/how-to-transfer-your-epf-account-online/articleshow/71934423.cms?from=mdr|title=How to transfer your EPF account online|date=2020-01-13|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nThere are new UAN portal start to check your EPF balance and nowadays all the details like how to check UAN status,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=uan Registration & activation status procedure|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> download UAN EPF passbook,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epf-balance-and-epfo-balance/|title=3+ ways to know\u00a0your EPF Balance with uan & mobile|author=|date=30 September 2018|website=epfuanlogin.com}}</ref> check EPF balance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/transfer-pf-amount/|title=pf transfer withdrawal process -TDS|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> provident fund claim and many more facility provided by new UAN portal.\n\nEPFO has now started to provide the refund of Administrative charges if all the KYC details are updated for all employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=EPFO UAN Member portal Login registration features passbook etc - UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login|author=|date=|website=UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login}}</ref> This incentive program is announced for the Year 2016-2017.\n\nThe member who is unable to withdraw PF for any reason can withdraw without consent of employer.

This church is often known as the Nestorian Church, due to its adoption of the doctrine of [[Nestorianism]], which emphasized the disunity of the divine and human natures of Christ. It has also been known as the Persia Church, the East Syrian Church, the Assyrian Church, and, in China, as the \"Luminous Religion\".\n\nThe Church of the East developed almost wholly apart from the [[Early centers of Christianity|Greek and Roman churches]]. In the 5th century it endorsed the doctrine of [[Nestorius]], [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 428 to  431, especially following the [[Nestorian Schism]] after the condemnation of Nestorius for [[heresy]] at the [[First Council of Ephesus]]. For at least twelve hundred years the Church of the East was noted for its missionary zeal, its high degree of [[Laity|lay]] participation, its superior educational standards and cultural contributions in less developed countries, and its fortitude in the face of persecution.\n\n====Persian Empires====\n{{Main|Christianity in Iran}}\nThe Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] (now [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]) in northwestern Mesopotamia was from apostolic times the principal center of [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking Christianity. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. The missionary movement in the East began which gradually spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]] and by AD 280. While the rulers of the Second Persian empire (226-640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, they later gave Christians the same status as a subject race. These rulers encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of [[Zoroastrianism]] and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians.\n\nThe metropolis of [[Seleucia]] assumed the title of \"Catholicos\", (Patriarch) and in AD 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East, including India and [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka). The establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.\n\n====Fourth-century persecution====\nWhen Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman Empire which was previously violently anti-Christian became pro-Christian, the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \"enemy within\", became violently anti-Christian. The great persecution fell upon the Christians in Persia about the year 340. Though the religious motives were never unrelated, the primary cause of the persecution was political.\n\nIt was about 315 that an ill-advised letter from the Christian emperor Constantine to his Persian counterpart [[Shapur II]] probably triggered the beginnings of an ominous change in the Persian attitude toward Christians. Constantine believed he was writing to help his fellow believers in Persia but succeeded only in exposing them. He wrote to the young shah:\n{{Quote|I rejoice to hear that the fairest provinces of Persia are adorned with...Christians...Since you are so powerful and pious, I commend them to your care, and leave them in your protection''{{Ref|AFM}}\".\nIt was enough to make any Persian ruler conditioned by 300 years of war with Rome suspicious of the emergence of a fifth column. Any lingering doubts must have been dispelled when about twenty years later when Constantine began to gather his forces for war in the East. Eusebius records that Roman bishops were prepared to accompany their emperor to \"''battle with him and for him by prayers to God whom all victory proceeds''\".{{Ref|AFM}} And across the border in Persian territory the forthright Persian preacher Aphrahat recklessly predicted on the basis of his reading of Old testament prophecy that Rome would defeat Persia.{{Ref|AFM}}}}\n\nIt is little wonder then, that when the persecutions began shortly thereafter, the first accusation brought against the Christians was that they were aiding the Roman enemy. The shah Shapur II's response was to order a double taxation on Christians and to hold the bishop responsible for collecting it. He knew they were poor and that the bishop would be hard-pressed to find the money. Bishop Simon refused to be intimidated. He branded the tax as unjust and declared, \"''I am no tax collector but a shepherd of the Lord's flock''.\" Then the killings began.\n\nA second decree ordered the destruction of churches and the execution of clergy who refused to participate in the national worship of the sun. Bishop simon was seized and brought before the shah and was offered gifts to make a token obeisance to the sun, and when he refused, they cunningly tempted him with the promise that if he alone would apostatize his people would not be harmed, but that if he refused he would be condemning not just the church leaders but all Christians to destruction. At that, the Christians themselves rose up and refused to accept such a deliverance as shameful. So according to the tradition in the year 344, he was led outside the city of Susa along with a large number of Christian clergy. Five bishops and one hundred priests were beheaded before his eyes, and last of all he himself was put to death.{{Ref|AFM}}\n\nFor the next two decades and more, Christians were tracked down and hunted from one end of the empire to the other. At times the pattern was general massacre. More often, as Shapur decreed, it was intensive organized elimination of the leadership of the church, the clergy. A third category of suppression was the search for that part of the Christian community that was most vulnerable to persecution, Persians who had been converted from the national religion, Zoroastrianism. As we have already seen, the faith had spread first among non-Persian elements in the population, Jews and Syrians. But by the beginning of the 4th century, Iranians in increasing numbers were attracted to the Christian faith. For such converts, church membership could mean the loss of everything \u2013 family, property rights, and life itself. Converts from the \"national faith\" had no rights and, in the darker years of the persecution, were often put to death. Sometime before the death of [[Shapur II]] in 379, the intensity of the persecution slackened. Tradition calls it a forty-year persecution, lasting from 339-379 and ending only with Shapur's death.\n\n===Caucasus===\nChristianity became the official religion of [[Armenia]] in 301 or 314,<ref>[http://www.armenianhistory.info/christianity.htm Armenian History, Chapter III]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> when Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire.

In the 4th century, the early process of [[Christianization]] of the various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]] was partly facilitated by the prestige of the Christian [[Roman Empire]] amongst European pagans. Until the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the Germanic [[tribe]]s who had migrated there (with the exceptions of the [[Saxons]], [[Franks]], and [[Lombards]], see below) had converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\">Padberg 1998, 26</ref> Many of them, notably the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], adopted [[Arianism]] instead of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] (a.k.a.

Most members of other tribes converted to Christianity when their respective tribes settled within the Empire, and most Franks and Anglo-Saxons converted a few generations later. During the later centuries following the [[Fall of Rome]], as [[East\u2013West Schism|schism]] between the [[diocese]]s loyal to the [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] in the [[Catholic Church|West]] and those loyal to the other [[Patriarch]]s in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|East]], most of the Germanic peoples (excepting the [[Crimean Goths]] and a few other eastern groups) would gradually become strongly allied with the Catholic Church in the West, particularly as a result of the reign of [[Charlemagne]].\n\n====Goths====\n{{Main|Gothic Christianity}}\nIn the 3rd century, East-Germanic peoples migrated into Scythia. Gothic culture and identity emerged from various East-Germanic, local, and Roman influences. In the same period, Gothic raiders took captives among the Romans, including many Christians, (and Roman-supported raiders took captives among the Goths).\n\nWulfila or [[Ulfilas]] was the son or grandson of Christian captives from Sadagolthina in Cappadocia. In 337 or 341, Wulfila became the first bishop of the (Christian) Goths. By 348, one of the (Pagan) Gothic kings (reikos) began persecuting the Christian Goths, and Wulfila and many other Christian Goths fled to [[Moesia Secunda]] (in modern [[Bulgaria]]) in the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA2\">[[Philostorgius]] via Photius, ''Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius'', book 2, chapter 5.</ref><ref>[[Auxentius of Durostorum]], ''Letter of Auxentius'', quoted in Heather and Matthews, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', pp. 141-142.</ref> Other Christians, including [[Wereka and Batwin|Wereka, Batwin]], and [[Sabbas the Goth|Saba]], died in later persecutions.\n\nBetween 348 and 383, Wulfila translated the Bible into the [[Gothic language]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA2\"/><ref>[[Auxentius of Durostorum]], ''Letter of Auxentius'', quoted in Heather and Matthews, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', p. 140.</ref> Thus some Arian Christians in the west used the vernacular languages, in this case including Gothic and Latin, for services, as did Christians in the eastern Roman provinces, while most Christians in the western provinces used Latin.\n\n====Franks & Alemanni====\n[[File:Christogramvormig beslag in brons, 375 tot 450 NC, vindplaats- Neerharen-Rekem, 1982, Germaanse nederzetting, afvalkuil 7, collectie Gallo-Romeins Museum Tongeren, 81.NE.023.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Chi Rho]] applique in bronze found in a Germanic settlement in Neerharen (Belgium), 375-450 CE, [[Gallo-Roman Museum, Tongeren|Gallo-Roman Museum (Tongeren)]]]]\nThe [[Franks]] and their ruling [[Merovingian dynasty]], that had migrated to [[Gaul]] from the 3rd century had remained pagan at first.

With Christianity the dominant faith in some urban centers, Christians accounted for approximately 10% of the Roman population by 300, according to some estimates.<ref>Hopkins(1998), p. 191</ref>\n\nBy the latter half of the second century, Christianity had spread east throughout [[Medes|Media]], Persia, [[Parthia]], and [[Bactria]]. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman.\n\nVarious theories attempt to explain how Christianity managed to spread so successfully prior to the [[Edict of Milan]] (313). In ''[[The Rise of Christianity]]'', [[Rodney Stark]] argues that Christianity replaced [[paganism]] chiefly because it improved the lives of its adherents in various ways.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise of Christianity|last=Stark|first=Rodney|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0691027494|author-link=Rodney Stark}}</ref> Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8 argues that Christianity was helped by its promise of a general [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[End time|end of the world]] which was compatible with the [[Resurrection#Ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek belief]] that true [[Eternal life (Christianity)|immortality]] depended on the survival of the body.<ref>Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8.

This church is often known as the Nestorian Church, due to its adoption of the doctrine of [[Nestorianism]], which emphasized the disunity of the divine and human natures of Christ. It has also been known as the Persia Church, the East Syrian Church, the Assyrian Church, and, in China, as the \"Luminous Religion\".\n\nThe Church of the East developed almost wholly apart from the [[Early centers of Christianity|Greek and Roman churches]]. In the 5th century it endorsed the doctrine of [[Nestorius]], [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 428 to  431, especially following the [[Nestorian Schism]] after the condemnation of Nestorius for [[heresy]] at the [[First Council of Ephesus]]. For at least twelve hundred years the Church of the East was noted for its missionary zeal, its high degree of [[Laity|lay]] participation, its superior educational standards and cultural contributions in less developed countries, and its fortitude in the face of persecution.\n\n====Persian Empires====\n{{Main|Christianity in Iran}}\nThe Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] (now [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]) in northwestern Mesopotamia was from apostolic times the principal center of [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking Christianity. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. The missionary movement in the East began which gradually spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]] and by AD 280. While the rulers of the Second Persian empire (226-640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, they later gave Christians the same status as a subject race. These rulers encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of [[Zoroastrianism]] and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians.\n\nThe metropolis of [[Seleucia]] assumed the title of \"Catholicos\", (Patriarch) and in AD 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East, including India and [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka). The establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.\n\n====Fourth-century persecution====\nWhen Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman Empire which was previously violently anti-Christian became pro-Christian, the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \"enemy within\", became violently anti-Christian. The great persecution fell upon the Christians in Persia about the year 340. Though the religious motives were never unrelated, the primary cause of the persecution was political.\n\nIt was about 315 that an ill-advised letter from the Christian emperor Constantine to his Persian counterpart [[Shapur II]] probably triggered the beginnings of an ominous change in the Persian attitude toward Christians. Constantine believed he was writing to help his fellow believers in Persia but succeeded only in exposing them. He wrote to the young shah:\n{{Quote|I rejoice to hear that the fairest provinces of Persia are adorned with...Christians...Since you are so powerful and pious, I commend them to your care, and leave them in your protection''{{Ref|AFM}}\".\nIt was enough to make any Persian ruler conditioned by 300 years of war with Rome suspicious of the emergence of a fifth column. Any lingering doubts must have been dispelled when about twenty years later when Constantine began to gather his forces for war in the East. Eusebius records that Roman bishops were prepared to accompany their emperor to \"''battle with him and for him by prayers to God whom all victory proceeds''\".{{Ref|AFM}} And across the border in Persian territory the forthright Persian preacher Aphrahat recklessly predicted on the basis of his reading of Old testament prophecy that Rome would defeat Persia.{{Ref|AFM}}}}\n\nIt is little wonder then, that when the persecutions began shortly thereafter, the first accusation brought against the Christians was that they were aiding the Roman enemy. The shah Shapur II's response was to order a double taxation on Christians and to hold the bishop responsible for collecting it. He knew they were poor and that the bishop would be hard-pressed to find the money. Bishop Simon refused to be intimidated. He branded the tax as unjust and declared, \"''I am no tax collector but a shepherd of the Lord's flock''.\" Then the killings began.\n\nA second decree ordered the destruction of churches and the execution of clergy who refused to participate in the national worship of the sun. Bishop simon was seized and brought before the shah and was offered gifts to make a token obeisance to the sun, and when he refused, they cunningly tempted him with the promise that if he alone would apostatize his people would not be harmed, but that if he refused he would be condemning not just the church leaders but all Christians to destruction. At that, the Christians themselves rose up and refused to accept such a deliverance as shameful. So according to the tradition in the year 344, he was led outside the city of Susa along with a large number of Christian clergy. Five bishops and one hundred priests were beheaded before his eyes, and last of all he himself was put to death.{{Ref|AFM}}\n\nFor the next two decades and more, Christians were tracked down and hunted from one end of the empire to the other. At times the pattern was general massacre. More often, as Shapur decreed, it was intensive organized elimination of the leadership of the church, the clergy. A third category of suppression was the search for that part of the Christian community that was most vulnerable to persecution, Persians who had been converted from the national religion, Zoroastrianism. As we have already seen, the faith had spread first among non-Persian elements in the population, Jews and Syrians. But by the beginning of the 4th century, Iranians in increasing numbers were attracted to the Christian faith. For such converts, church membership could mean the loss of everything \u2013 family, property rights, and life itself. Converts from the \"national faith\" had no rights and, in the darker years of the persecution, were often put to death. Sometime before the death of [[Shapur II]] in 379, the intensity of the persecution slackened. Tradition calls it a forty-year persecution, lasting from 339-379 and ending only with Shapur's death.\n\n===Caucasus===\nChristianity became the official religion of [[Armenia]] in 301 or 314,<ref>[http://www.armenianhistory.info/christianity.htm Armenian History, Chapter III]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> when Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire.

In the 4th century, the early process of [[Christianization]] of the various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]] was partly facilitated by the prestige of the Christian [[Roman Empire]] amongst European pagans. Until the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the Germanic [[tribe]]s who had migrated there (with the exceptions of the [[Saxons]], [[Franks]], and [[Lombards]], see below) had converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\">Padberg 1998, 26</ref> Many of them, notably the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], adopted [[Arianism]] instead of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] (a.k.a. [[First Council of Nicea|Nicene]] or ''orthodox'') beliefs that were dogmatically defined by the [[Church Fathers]] in the [[Nicene Creed]] and [[Council of Chalcedon]].<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\"/> The gradual rise of Germanic Christianity was, at times, voluntary, particularly amongst groups associated with the Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the 6th century AD, Germanic tribes were converted (and re-converted) by [[Missionary|missionaries]] of the Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nMany Goths converted to Christianity as individuals outside the Roman Empire. Most members of other tribes converted to Christianity when their respective tribes settled within the Empire, and most Franks and Anglo-Saxons converted a few generations later. During the later centuries following the [[Fall of Rome]], as [[East\u2013West Schism|schism]] between the [[diocese]]s loyal to the [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] in the [[Catholic Church|West]] and those loyal to the other [[Patriarch]]s in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|East]], most of the Germanic peoples (excepting the [[Crimean Goths]] and a few other eastern groups) would gradually become strongly allied with the Catholic Church in the West, particularly as a result of the reign of [[Charlemagne]].\n\n====Goths====\n{{Main|Gothic Christianity}}\nIn the 3rd century, East-Germanic peoples migrated into Scythia. Gothic culture and identity emerged from various East-Germanic, local, and Roman influences. In the same period, Gothic raiders took captives among the Romans, including many Christians, (and Roman-supported raiders took captives among the Goths).\n\nWulfila or [[Ulfilas]] was the son or grandson of Christian captives from Sadagolthina in Cappadocia. In 337 or 341, Wulfila became the first bishop of the (Christian) Goths. By 348, one of the (Pagan) Gothic kings (reikos) began persecuting the Christian Goths, and Wulfila and many other Christian Goths fled to [[Moesia Secunda]] (in modern [[Bulgaria]]) in the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA2\">[[Philostorgius]] via Photius, ''Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius'', book 2, chapter 5.</ref><ref>[[Auxentius of Durostorum]], ''Letter of Auxentius'', quoted in Heather and Matthews, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', pp. 141-142.</ref> Other Christians, including [[Wereka and Batwin|Wereka, Batwin]], and [[Sabbas the Goth|Saba]], died in later persecutions.\n\nBetween 348 and 383, Wulfila translated the Bible into the [[Gothic language]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA2\"/><ref>[[Auxentius of Durostorum]], ''Letter of Auxentius'', quoted in Heather and Matthews, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', p. 140.</ref> Thus some Arian Christians in the west used the vernacular languages, in this case including Gothic and Latin, for services, as did Christians in the eastern Roman provinces, while most Christians in the western provinces used Latin.\n\n====Franks & Alemanni====\n[[File:Christogramvormig beslag in brons, 375 tot 450 NC, vindplaats- Neerharen-Rekem, 1982, Germaanse nederzetting, afvalkuil 7, collectie Gallo-Romeins Museum Tongeren, 81.NE.023.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Chi Rho]] applique in bronze found in a Germanic settlement in Neerharen (Belgium), 375-450 CE, [[Gallo-Roman Museum, Tongeren|Gallo-Roman Museum (Tongeren)]]]]\nThe [[Franks]] and their ruling [[Merovingian dynasty]], that had migrated to [[Gaul]] from the 3rd century had remained pagan at first.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Their compensation will be significantly lower than the outgoing CEOs. They will be joined by equally strong non-executive chairmen.\n# Other management action will be very limited. The new CEOs agreed it is important to work with the current management teams and employees to encourage them to stay and to continue to  make important improvements to the Enterprises.\n# To conserve over $2 billion annually in capital the common  stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated, but the common and all preferred stocks will continue to remain outstanding. Subordinated debt interest and principal payments will continue to be made.\n# All political activities, including all lobbying, will be halted immediately. Charitable activities will be reviewed.\n# There will be financing and investing relationship with the U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities, to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the liquidity of the mortgage market.

Moffett]] for Freddie Mac. Allison is former Vice Chairman of [[Merrill Lynch]] and for the last eight years chairman of [[TIAA-CREF]]. Moffett is the former Vice Chairman and CFO of [[US Bancorp]]. Their compensation will be significantly lower than the outgoing CEOs. They will be joined by equally strong non-executive chairmen.\n# Other management action will be very limited. The new CEOs agreed it is important to work with the current management teams and employees to encourage them to stay and to continue to  make important improvements to the Enterprises.\n# To conserve over $2 billion annually in capital the common  stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated, but the common and all preferred stocks will continue to remain outstanding. Subordinated debt interest and principal payments will continue to be made.\n# All political activities, including all lobbying, will be halted immediately. Charitable activities will be reviewed.\n# There will be financing and investing relationship with the U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities, to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the liquidity of the mortgage market.
