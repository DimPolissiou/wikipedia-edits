Jackson]], [[Doc Shaw]] and [[Jim Belushi]]. The plot follows a boy who magically gets Durant's basketball skills and the duo must figure out how to return them. He then found out Lebron James ate his mom while she ate cumin seeds It was released on August 24, 2012.<ref name=\"DurantPremieres\" /><ref name=\"Release\" />\n\n==Plot==\nBrian is a 16-year-old living in [[Oklahoma]]. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, relegated to being [[water boy]] for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] game against the [[Detroit Pistons]] at [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City]].\n\nAt halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits [[Rumble the Bison|Rumble, the mascot]] in the process. Later on, he meets [[Kevin Durant]] and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.\n\nThe next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to \"do better\", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.\n\nAfter making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.\n\nShortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].\n\nAt the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Taylor Gray]] as Brian Newall\n*[[Kevin Durant]] as himself\n*[[Brandon T.

Riddick''', more commonly known as '''Riddick''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[antiheroic]] [[protagonist]] of the [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''Chronicles of Riddick'' series]], including the animated short movie ''[[Dark Fury]]'' and the video games ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay|Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena|Assault on Dark Athena]]''. Actor [[Vin Diesel]] has played the [[title role]] in all of the Riddick-based films and video games thus far.\n\nWithin the canon of the series, Riddick is shown to have a vast number of skills, which include mobility, stealth, murdering, surviving, prison breaking, and piloting. Despite his criminal nature and background, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature.\n\nRiddick is Furyan, a member of a warrior race of adapted humans obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate, and is one of the last of his kind. One of his most defining features are his eyes, a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species (the Alpha-Furyans), although he implies in ''Pitch Black'' that they were \"shined\" by a back-alley surgical operation. This allows him to see clearly in the dark, but also makes him vulnerable to strong light; he wears tinted [[welding goggles]] for protection.\n\nRiddick was once a mercenary, then part of a security force,<ref name=\"ChroniclesDVD\">''The Chronicles of Riddick'', Special Features</ref> and later a soldier.\n\n==Biography ==\n===Early life===\nRiddick was born on Furya. Before Riddick's birth, a Necromonger officer named [[The Chronicles of Riddick (series)#Zhylaw/Lord Marshal|Zhylaw]] (who would eventually become the Lord Marshall) consulted an Elemental seer, who told him that a [[Furyan]] male would be born that would be responsible for his downfall. This prompted Zhylaw to attack Furya and attempt to massacre all male children, going so far as to personally strangle newborn infants with their own umbilical cords. Riddick was among those presumably strangled, but he survived.\n\nIn later life, Riddick repressed his memories of Furya, including those of the massacre. He came to believe that when he was born, his mother attempted to strangle him and left him in a trash bin behind a [[liquor store]]. Despite this, he periodically received visions and messages from a Furyan survivor named Shirah, which he thought were signs of mental instability.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nLittle is known about Riddick's childhood, save that he had no formal education and seemed to have been in trouble with the law from an early age. He claims to have been \"educated\" in the penal system.\n\n===''Pitch Black''===\n{{Main|Pitch Black (film)}}\nIn the premiere installment in the franchise, Riddick is introduced as a notorious convict en route to a penal institution with his captor, a bounty hunter named William J. Johns. By impersonating a cop and traveling with a group of settlers aboard the nondescript transport cruiser ''Hunter Gratzner'', Johns hopes to safely convey Riddick back to a prison colony and collect the outlaw's enormous bounty. However, the ship inadvertently passes through a comet's tail while on autopilot, forcing it to crash land on an unknown planet with three suns. Soon the survivors find themselves fighting for their lives against a predatory species called Bio-Raptors, and by the end of the film there are only three survivors: Riddick, a young girl called Jack, and Imam.\n\n===''Dark Fury''===\n{{Main|Dark Fury}}\nShortly after escaping the planet from ''Pitch Black'', Riddick, Jack, and the Imam are picked up by a Mercenary spacecraft. Although Riddick attempts to conceal his identity from the mercenaries by impersonating William J. Johns (in Pitch Black) over the intercom, they quickly voice-print and identify him. \n\nCaptured by the mercenaries, the trio of survivors discover that their captors have unusual plans for Riddick. The ship's owner, ''Antonia Chillingsworth'', collects criminals, whom she freezes and keeps as statues that are, in her view, art. Although the criminals are frozen, they are alive and conscious. To her Riddick is the ultimate \"masterpiece\" for her collection. Riddick, Jack, and Imam must fight their way through the army of human and alien creatures at her disposal or they will meet a fate crueler than death. Once they have killed most of the mercs on the ship, the trio takes one of Antonia's shuttles and head for New Mecca (although at one point the navicomp shows a potential course for Furya), where Riddick leaves them before heading for the planet UV 6.\n\n===''The Chronicles of Riddick''===\n{{Main|The Chronicles of Riddick}}\nFive years later, Riddick has remained in hiding on an [[Arctic]] planet called U.V. for its harsh [[Ultraviolet]] light. Meanwhile, Imam, learning that his own planet, Helion Prime,  will be invaded by the twisted religious crusade of the Necromongers, recalls the story Riddick told him of his Furyan origins, and betrays Riddick's location to the Helion Prime leaders. Initially, Riddick is reluctant to become involved in the struggle between the Necromongers and the world they seek to conquer. But when Imam is killed, Riddick sets out on a mission to avenge him, eventually overthrowing the Lord Marshal (with help from Jack, who dies in the process) and inheriting his office.<ref>simply read original article and watched the series</ref>\n\n===''Riddick''===\n{{Main|Riddick (film)}}\nDissatisfied with his role as Lord Marshal, Riddick attempts to find Furya, but is instead abandoned on a desolate planet. After spending some time on this world, Riddick finds that he will soon be overtaken by a vicious storm that provides cover for countless predators.  Using the communication system from a mercenary outpost, Riddick lures two ships to the planet, intending to commandeer one of them; but his plan is complicated when he finds that one of the arriving mercenaries is the father of his old enemy, Johns the bounty hunter. Riddick uses the approaching storm to force the mercenaries to cooperate, but he is left surrounded by enemies and nearly killed. To his surprise, the elder Johns rescues him and allows him to leave. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Eyeshine===\n{{See also|Tapetum lucidum}}\nAccording to Riddick, while in Butcher Bay he received [[eye surgery]] (a \"surgical shine job\", as he calls it) from a doctor who gave him permanent [[night vision]] in exchange for \"20 [[menthol]] [[Kool (cigarette)|KOOL]]s\". The surgery made his eyes more sensitive to normal light, requiring him to wear welding goggles to protect them (although he has also been shown without the goggles in a regularly illuminated room).\n\nIn the flash movie on the Pitchblack.com website, Riddick gets the eye-shine to give him more of an advantage following an encounter with humanoids called \"shiners\". Referring to Riddick as \"darkeye\", they have had the same operation to see in the dark bowels of the Ursa Luna prison where the guards do not tend to go. The eye-shine surgery seems to be performed by a bovine veterinarian on board a prison facility where Riddick arrived only a few hours before and from which he is already in the process of escaping.  Riddick elects to have no anesthetic, despite the procedure involving cutting the cornea and drilling through the eye to inject a reflective substance behind the retina.  The cost quoted to Riddick is 1000 creds. Having no cash, Riddick offers down payment of a pack of Kool cigarettes which he earlier took from a guard. He also takes some welder's goggles from the facility.\n\nThe video game, ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' (which serves as a prequel to ''Pitch Black''), clarifies that Riddick's eyeshine is more than just something he picked up in a prison. After helping a character called \"Pope Joe\" retrieve his \"blessed voice box\", a radio that picks up religious programming (including a Necromonger [[Talk Show]]), Riddick goes into a den to get stitches for an injury. After he is finished receiving stitches, Joe tells him how to escape, and, perhaps coincidentally, warns Riddick not to \"trust [his] eyes\"; at that moment, a ghostly voice informs Riddick that he has \"been blind for far too long...\" and that he is to receive a gift. It is at this moment that Riddick receives his eyeshine. The mysterious voice belongs to a character named \"Shirah\", who appears to serve as a sort of spiritual guide to Riddick, helping him awaken the Furyan abilities that lie dormant within him.  In the ''Chronicles of Riddick'' film, Jack/Kyra angrily tells Riddick that when she was sent to prison, she found out that it is impossible to find anyone who can perform a \"surgical shine job\" at any price, and accuses him of lying about how he received his night vision.\n\nLight amplification surgery, somewhat similar in effect to Riddick's eyeshine, has been patented in real life.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16315-invention-vision-amplifier.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=invention New Scientist - Vision Amplifier]</ref><ref>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2008106605 METHOD FOR STIMULATING RETINAL RESPONSE USING PHOTOACTIVE DEVICES]</ref>\n\n===Wrath of the Furyans===\nAside from helping Riddick unlock his eyeshine, the character Shirah also either allows or helps Riddick discover his ability to unleash a sort of energy wave. It is shown in the director's cut of ''The Chronicles of Riddick'' after she lays her hand on Riddick's chest, leaving a glowing blue hand print, and says, \"this mark carries the anger of an entire race... but it's going to hurt\". After either receiving a shot from Vaako's energy handgun or a fraction of a second before the discharge of said weapon, she immediately emits a large blast of blue energy from Riddick (or Riddick himself does so with her guidance), leaving the group of surrounding [[The Necromonger Way|Necromongers]] dead. This ability is also displayed off screen in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay|Escape from Butcher Bay]]''.\n\n===Physical abilities===\nAside from his more supernatural skills, Riddick is in superlative physical condition and is an exceptional fighter with or without the use of his eyes. Whether as a result of his Furyan heritage or simply training, Riddick is stronger, faster, more agile, tougher, more resistant to damage and injury, possessing more acute senses, immense stamina, and superior healing when compared to most humans; he is shown on more than one occasion dislocating his limbs for brief moments with only slight signs of discomfort, although he was in more obvious pain when his leg was broken in a fall, and had to use a heated rock to cauterize a wound when he was impaled in the chest by a creature's sharpened tooth. In general, Riddick possesses an abnormally high [[threshold of pain]] and psychologically channels what pain he does feel into anger. His ability to cope with toxins is also heightened; when a merc team was attempting to take him out with [[horse]] [[tranquilizers]], it took four darts just to make Riddick stop running, and he still remained conscious until he was hit in the head. His ability to cope with pain, stress and situational panic is most likely the main reason behind his success, which combined with his sharp intelligence gives Riddick the ability to escape from any situation.\n\nRiddick's abilities at [[hand-to-hand combat]] is a mix of '''[[Krav Maga]]''', '''[[Hapkido]]''', '''[[Eskrima]]''', and '''[[Ninjutsu]]'''; he uses his formidable fighting skills while confronting one of the night-creatures of ''Pitch Black'' with only his bare hands and a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]] he had made, killing it with relative ease, as well as defeating one of the Lord Marshal's best Necromonger warriors in a matter of seconds in ''Chronicles''.  Also, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal and even injure him which the Lord Marshal admitted hadn't happened in a long time.  While Riddick was no match for him in speed, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal for several minutes.\n\n===Intelligence===\nDespite his harsh upbringing and violent attitude, Riddick has been shown to have a certain knack for [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], rapidly deducing what had happened to the original inhabitants of the mining base where he and the other crash survivors had been staying, as well as finding the creature's blind spot in ''Pitch Black'' and swiftly deducing what had caused the firefight between the Warden's and Toombs' men in ''The Chronicles of Riddick''. He has also been described as having \"a knack for escape\", surviving not only the Lord Marshall's purge of the Furyans when he was an infant but subsequently escaping from various prisons over the course of his life. He is also able to quickly judge the quality of, and find even seemingly minor flaws in most weaponry, down to very specific details. In one case, Riddick concluded that the prized dagger of a Necromonger was \"a half gram too heavy on the back end\" after an inspection lasting all of a couple of seconds, although the tone of voice in which he delivered this appraisal suggested pre-fight bravado rather than abstract fact. His only weakness (other than [[light sensitivity]], leaving him in pain when in daylight without his goggles), as stated in the ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' [[DVD]], is his soft spot for children and anyone who really grows on him (those people become his friends), which resulted in his capture by the [[bounty hunter]] Johns ([[Cole Hauser]]). While he may be a ruthless killer when necessary, Riddick has never been shown to kill anyone who was not actively trying to kill him first, and has been known to help people in need only if they don't slow him down or make him vulnerable. The only exception to this was when, in ''Pitch Black'', he returned with Carolyn to help the others, after she pleaded with him. He also mentions on board the Dark Athena that people he helps often end up dead. In ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', he considered it an insult, when he discovered the bounty placed on him was around a million of the currency for most planets, and when Toombs has a small crew to capture him (it was originally four crew members, then it was five).\n\nIn addition to raw [[analytical skill|analytical]] power, Riddick is generally an astute judge of character, especially in the dark side of human nature. A killer himself and resident of several maximum security facilities, he is often able to predict an individual's negative impulses before they act on them. He has been known to be surprised on occasion, such as when Carolyn Fry in ''Pitch Black'' altruistically gave up a fast escape to save Jack and Imam from the alien creatures. Riddick was also surprised when he underestimated Jack's (Kyra's) affection toward him between ''Pitch Black'' and ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', only learning of it after she had become a mercenary and resident of a maximum security prison in order to see him once again. Otherwise, he correctly predicted which of the group in ''Pitch Black'' would turn on each other (in particular that Johns would try to double-cross Fry), and that the mercs and guards on Crematoria would turn on each other prior to his escape attempt. In ''Riddick'', he appeared pleasantly surprised to learn that Johns' father was a better man than his son, complimenting Johns' nerve when he came back to help Riddick when he didn't have to.\n\n===Willpower===\nOne major characteristic of Riddick is his indomitable will.  Despite finding himself in situations where the odds of survival and/or escape would seem insurmountable, Riddick always pushes forward and never gives up.  Faced with several creatures far more powerful than himself, or any human for that matter, he has shown himself to be capable of evading, killing, or even taming them. He has escaped out of prisons when most prisoners would resign themselves to captivity. When Riddick was mentally probed by the Quasi-Dead of the Necromongers, he not only resisted them, but also retaliated, the Quasi-Dead's containers actually exploding from the strain of trying to process Riddick. Given the Necromongers' apparent faith in and respect for the power of the Quasi-Dead, this is a very impressive feat. Perhaps even greater was his ability to resist the Lord Marshall's attempt to steal his soul.  The one time his will seemed to waver was when Kyra was killed, sacrificing herself to save him and help him defeat the Lord Marshal, and even then he channeled his loss into new strength. Soonthereafter, his willpower enabled him to kill Zhylaw and thereby become Lord Mother****er.\n\n===Weapons===\nRiddick is deadly with any weapon that he can get his hands on, but his weapon of choice is undoubtedly a knife. However, Riddick's most famous weapons are surely a pair of Ulak blades that he is seen using during his escape from Crematoria in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''.\n\nHe has also been known to use anything from Necromonger gravity rifles, teacups and anything in between. Riddick can also kill efficiently without using a weapon.  In the second film, he used the knife he took from Irgun as his weapon during his fight with him and the Lord Marshall, killing both with it. The third film sees him predominately relying on a bone-sword he made from the remains of a creature he had killed.\n\n==Other appearances==\nRiddick's first appearance outside ''Pitch Black'' was a guest appearance and potential recruit in ''[[Fallout Tactics]]''. He appears in the game during a random special encounter, aptly titled ''Pitch Black''. Like his movie origin, Riddick is a stealth focused melee fighter with advanced hand-to-hand fighting skills and the ability to see in the dark.\n\nRiddick has appeared as a playable character in the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Deathrow (game)|Deathrow]]''. He is one of the final players available on the Convicts team and has the highest amount of strength and aggression of all recruitable Convict players, although he has the equal-lowest teamplay rating in the game.\n\nBehind the scenes Richard B. Riddick first appeared in ''Pitch Black: Slam City'', a Shockwave prequel comic on the official ''Pitch Black'' website, one month before the release of the movie. In the film, and in all subsequent appearances the character has been portrayed by Vin Diesel.\n\nIn Jim and Ken Wheat's original script for ''Pitch Black'', the Riddick character was a woman named Taras Krieg.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Chronicles of Riddick}}\n{{Vin Diesel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riddick, Richard B.}}\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional monster hunters]]\n[[Category:Fictional blind characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional hapkido practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional eskrimadors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Krav Maga practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters]]\n[[Category:Action film characters]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\n[[Category:Video game protagonists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{fanpov|date=September 2013}}\n{{in-universe|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Riddick\n| series             = [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|The Chronicles of Riddick]]\n| image              = Riddick - photo.jpg\n| caption            = Vin Diesel as Riddick\n| first              = ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''\n| creator            = [[David Twohy]]<br>Jim Wheat<br>[[Ken Wheat]]\n| portrayer          = [[Vin Diesel]]\n| nickname           = Riddick\n| species            = Furyan\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Fugitive]]\n* Former Lord Marshall\n* Former [[mercenary]] {{nowrap|(self-description)}}\n}}\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = None surviving\n| nationality        = Furya\n}}\n\n'''Richard B. Riddick''', more commonly known as '''Riddick''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[antiheroic]] [[protagonist]] of the [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''Chronicles of Riddick'' series]], including the animated short movie ''[[Dark Fury]]'' and the video games ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay|Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena|Assault on Dark Athena]]''. Actor [[Vin Diesel]] has played the [[title role]] in all of the Riddick-based films and video games thus far.\n\nWithin the canon of the series, Riddick is shown to have a vast number of skills, which include mobility, stealth, murdering, surviving, prison breaking, and piloting. Despite his criminal nature and background, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature.\n\nRiddick is Furyan, a member of a warrior race of adapted humans obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate, and is one of the last of his kind.

By impersonating a cop and traveling with a group of settlers aboard the nondescript transport cruiser ''Hunter Gratzner'', Johns hopes to safely convey Riddick back to a prison colony and collect the outlaw's enormous bounty. However, the ship inadvertently passes through a comet's tail while on autopilot, forcing it to crash land on an unknown planet with three suns.

Initially, Riddick is reluctant to become involved in the struggle between the Necromongers and the world they seek to conquer. But when Imam is killed, Riddick sets out on a mission to avenge him, eventually overthrowing the Lord Marshal (with help from Jack, who dies in the process) and inheriting his office.<ref>simply read original article and watched the series</ref>\n\n===''Riddick''===\n{{Main|Riddick (film)}}\nDissatisfied with his role as Lord Marshal, Riddick attempts to find Furya, but is instead abandoned on a desolate planet.

Using the communication system from a mercenary outpost, Riddick lures two ships to the planet, intending to commandeer one of them; but his plan is complicated when he finds that one of the arriving mercenaries is the father of his old enemy, Johns the bounty hunter. Riddick uses the approaching storm to force the mercenaries to cooperate, but he is left surrounded by enemies and nearly killed. To his surprise, the elder Johns rescues him and allows him to leave. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Eyeshine===\n{{See also|Tapetum lucidum}}\nAccording to Riddick, while in Butcher Bay he received [[eye surgery]] (a \"surgical shine job\", as he calls it) from a doctor who gave him permanent [[night vision]] in exchange for \"20 [[menthol]] [[Kool (cigarette)|KOOL]]s\". The surgery made his eyes more sensitive to normal light, requiring him to wear welding goggles to protect them (although he has also been shown without the goggles in a regularly illuminated room).\n\nIn the flash movie on the Pitchblack.com website, Riddick gets the eye-shine to give him more of an advantage following an encounter with humanoids called \"shiners\".

It is shown in the director's cut of ''The Chronicles of Riddick'' after she lays her hand on Riddick's chest, leaving a glowing blue hand print, and says, \"this mark carries the anger of an entire race... but it's going to hurt\". After either receiving a shot from Vaako's energy handgun or a fraction of a second before the discharge of said weapon, she immediately emits a large blast of blue energy from Riddick (or Riddick himself does so with her guidance), leaving the group of surrounding [[The Necromonger Way|Necromongers]] dead. This ability is also displayed off screen in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay|Escape from Butcher Bay]]''.\n\n===Physical abilities===\nAside from his more supernatural skills, Riddick is in superlative physical condition and is an exceptional fighter with or without the use of his eyes.

Also, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal and even injure him which the Lord Marshal admitted hadn't happened in a long time.  While Riddick was no match for him in speed, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal for several minutes.\n\n===Intelligence===\nDespite his harsh upbringing and violent attitude, Riddick has been shown to have a certain knack for [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], rapidly deducing what had happened to the original inhabitants of the mining base where he and the other crash survivors had been staying, as well as finding the creature's blind spot in ''Pitch Black'' and swiftly deducing what had caused the firefight between the Warden's and Toombs' men in ''The Chronicles of Riddick''. He has also been described as having \"a knack for escape\", surviving not only the Lord Marshall's purge of the Furyans when he was an infant but subsequently escaping from various prisons over the course of his life. He is also able to quickly judge the quality of, and find even seemingly minor flaws in most weaponry, down to very specific details.

While he may be a ruthless killer when necessary, Riddick has never been shown to kill anyone who was not actively trying to kill him first, and has been known to help people in need only if they don't slow him down or make him vulnerable. The only exception to this was when, in ''Pitch Black'', he returned with Carolyn to help the others, after she pleaded with him. He also mentions on board the Dark Athena that people he helps often end up dead. In ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', he considered it an insult, when he discovered the bounty placed on him was around a million of the currency for most planets, and when Toombs has a small crew to capture him (it was originally four crew members, then it was five).\n\nIn addition to raw [[analytical skill|analytical]] power, Riddick is generally an astute judge of character, especially in the dark side of human nature. A killer himself and resident of several maximum security facilities, he is often able to predict an individual's negative impulses before they act on them. He has been known to be surprised on occasion, such as when Carolyn Fry in ''Pitch Black'' altruistically gave up a fast escape to save Jack and Imam from the alien creatures. Riddick was also surprised when he underestimated Jack's (Kyra's) affection toward him between ''Pitch Black'' and ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', only learning of it after she had become a mercenary and resident of a maximum security prison in order to see him once again. Otherwise, he correctly predicted which of the group in ''Pitch Black'' would turn on each other (in particular that Johns would try to double-cross Fry), and that the mercs and guards on Crematoria would turn on each other prior to his escape attempt. In ''Riddick'', he appeared pleasantly surprised to learn that Johns' father was a better man than his son, complimenting Johns' nerve when he came back to help Riddick when he didn't have to.\n\n===Willpower===\nOne major characteristic of Riddick is his indomitable will.  Despite finding himself in situations where the odds of survival and/or escape would seem insurmountable, Riddick always pushes forward and never gives up.  Faced with several creatures far more powerful than himself, or any human for that matter, he has shown himself to be capable of evading, killing, or even taming them. He has escaped out of prisons when most prisoners would resign themselves to captivity. When Riddick was mentally probed by the Quasi-Dead of the Necromongers, he not only resisted them, but also retaliated, the Quasi-Dead's containers actually exploding from the strain of trying to process Riddick. Given the Necromongers' apparent faith in and respect for the power of the Quasi-Dead, this is a very impressive feat. Perhaps even greater was his ability to resist the Lord Marshall's attempt to steal his soul.  The one time his will seemed to waver was when Kyra was killed, sacrificing herself to save him and help him defeat the Lord Marshal, and even then he channeled his loss into new strength.\n\n===Weapons===\nRiddick is deadly with any weapon that he can get his hands on, but his weapon of choice is undoubtedly a knife. However, Riddick's most famous weapons are surely a pair of Ulak blades that he is seen using during his escape from Crematoria in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''.\n\nHe has also been known to use anything from Necromonger gravity rifles, teacups and anything in between. Riddick can also kill efficiently without using a weapon.  In the second film, he used the knife he took from Irgun as his weapon during his fight with him and the Lord Marshall, killing both with it. The third film sees him predominately relying on a bone-sword he made from the remains of a creature he had killed.\n\n==Other appearances==\nRiddick's first appearance outside ''Pitch Black'' was a guest appearance and potential recruit in ''[[Fallout Tactics]]''. He appears in the game during a random special encounter, aptly titled ''Pitch Black''. Like his movie origin, Riddick is a stealth focused melee fighter with advanced hand-to-hand fighting skills and the ability to see in the dark.\n\nRiddick has appeared as a playable character in the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Deathrow (game)|Deathrow]]''. He is one of the final players available on the Convicts team and has the highest amount of strength and aggression of all recruitable Convict players, although he has the equal-lowest teamplay rating in the game.\n\nBehind the scenes Richard B. Riddick first appeared in ''Pitch Black: Slam City'', a Shockwave prequel comic on the official ''Pitch Black'' website, one month before the release of the movie. In the film, and in all subsequent appearances the character has been portrayed by Vin Diesel.\n\nIn Jim and Ken Wheat's original script for ''Pitch Black'', the Riddick character was a woman named Taras Krieg.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Chronicles of Riddick}}\n{{Vin Diesel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riddick, Richard B.}}\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional monster hunters]]\n[[Category:Fictional blind characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional hapkido practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional eskrimadors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Krav Maga practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters]]\n[[Category:Action film characters]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\n[[Category:Video game protagonists]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1702:1140:c110:cdb:bcbd:be06:8595", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eWillpower)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddick_(character)"}

Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]].

The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership, and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game.

Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]], its general secretary, and the other members of the [[FIFA Council]] in the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=\"FIFA-congress\">{{cite news |date=27 May 2011 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405100855/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |title=FIFA Congress |publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\nFIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\n\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. [[Gianni Infantino]] is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president [[Sepp Blatter]] was suspended pending a [[2015 FIFA corruption case|corruption investigation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/iss-hayatou-acting-president-fifa-sepp-blatter-suspended |title=Issa Hayatou to be acting Fifa president following suspension of Sepp Blatter |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2015 |website=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/acting-president/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nFIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\n\n=== Video replay and goal-line technology ===\n{{See also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}\nFIFA now permits the use video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million.

The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected.

After several studies about the feasibility of creating such an institute, a working group was formed in the Austrian federal ministry of education and science and the four [[States of Austria|provinces]] of [[Lower Austria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]] and [[Vienna]] put in bids to host the new institute. In 2005, the council of ministers decided to build the institute in [[Klosterneuburg]], [[Lower Austria]].\n\nIn 2006, an international group of three scientists including [[Haim Harari]], Olaf Kuebler and [[Hubert Markl]] were invited by the Federation of Austrian Industries to advise the establishment of the institute and create a road map for it.

In January 2011, the Scientific Board organized the first independent evaluation of the new institute. The review panel consisted of six scientists who also had considerable experience in science management.
