It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to it's costume design, but saw criticism for it's screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

The accuracy of these listings is a local ranking factor.\n\n== Ranking factors ==\n[[File: Local Online Marketing.JPG|thumb|Local Online Marketing]]\nMajor search engines have algorithms that determine which local businesses rank in local search. Primary factors that impact a local business's chance of appearing in local search include proper categorization in business directories, a business's name, address, and phone number (NAP) being [[Web crawler|crawlable]] on the website, and citations (mentions of the local business on other relevant websites like a chamber of commerce website).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/citation-inconsistency-no1-issue-affecting-local-ranking-210643|title=Citation Inconsistency Is No.1 Issue Affecting Local Ranking|date=2014-12-22|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, a study using statistical analysis assessed how and why businesses ranked in the Local Packs and identified positive correlations between local rankings and 100+ ranking factors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/local-seo-ranking-factors-study-session-260605|title=Results from the Local SEO Ranking Factors Study presented at SMX East|date=2016-10-07|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Although the study cannot replicate Google's algorithm, it did deliver several interesting findings:\n* [[Backlink]]s showed the most important correlation (and also Google's Toolbar [[PageRank]], suggesting that older links are an advantage because the Toolbar has not been updated in a long time).\n* Sites with more content (hence more keywords) tended to fare better (as expected).\n* Reviews on GMB also were found to strongly correlate with high rankings.\n* Other GMB factors, like the presence of photos and having a verified GMB page with opening hours, showed a [[positive correlation]] (with ranking) albeit not as important as reviews.\n* The quality of citations such as a low number of duplicates, consistency and also a fair number of citations, mattered for a business to show in Local Packs. However, within the pack, citations did not influence their ranking: \"citations appear to be foundational but not a competitive advantage.\"\n* The authors were instead surprised that [[geotargeting]] elements (city & state) in the title of the GMB landing page did not have any impact on GMB rankings. Hence the authors suggest using such elements only if it makes sense for usability reasons.\n* The presence of a keyword in the business name was found to be one of the most important factors (explaining the high incidence of spam in the Local Pack).\n* Schema structured data is a ranking factor. The addition of the 'LocalBusiness' markup will enable you to display relevant information about your business to Google. This includes opening hours, address, founder, parent company information and much more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schema.org/LocalBusiness|title=LocalBusiness - schema.org|website=schema.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>\n*The number of reviews and overall star rating correlates with higher rankings in the Google map pack results.\n\n== Local ranking according to Google ==\nProminence, relevance, and distance are the three main criteria Google claims to use in its [[algorithms]] to show results that best match a user's query.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091|title=Improve your local ranking on Google - Google My Business Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>  \n* Prominence reflects how well-known is a place in the offline world. An important museum or store, for example, will be given more prominence. Google also uses information obtained on the web to assess prominence such as review counts, links, articles. \n* Relevance refers to Google's algorithms attempt to surface the listings that best match the user's query.  \n* Distance refers to Google's attempt to return those listings that are the closest the location terms used in a user's query. If no location term is used then \"Google will calculate distance based on what\u2019s known about their location\".\n\n== Local ranking: 2017 survey from 40 local experts ==\nAccording to a group of local SEO<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nexbit.us/|title=Basic Information About SEO|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> experts who took part in a survey, links and reviews are more important than ever to rank locally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/just-released-2017-local-search-ranking-factors-survey-results-273006|title=Just released: 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors survey results|date=2017-04-11|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Near Me Queries ==\nAs a result of both Google as well as Apple offering \"near me\" as an option to users, some authors<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/things-near-seo-268697|title='Things to do near me' SEO|date=2017-02-13|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref> report on how [[Google Trends]] shows very significant increases in \"near me\" queries. The same authors also report that the factors correlating the most with Local Pack ranking for \"near me\" queries include the presence of the \"searched city and state in backlinks' anchor text\" as well as the use of the \" 'near me' in internal link anchor text\"\n\n== Possum Update ==\nAn important update to Google's local algorithm, rolled out on the 1st of September 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/everything-need-know-googles-possum-algorithm-update-258900|title=Everything you need to know about Google's 'Possum' algorithm update|date=2016-09-21|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}</ref> Summary of the update on local search results:\n* Businesses based outside city physical limits showed a significant increase in ranking in the Google Local Pack\n* A more restrictive filter is in place. Before the update, Google filtered listings linking to the same [[website]] and using the same phone number. After the update, listings get filtered if they have the same address and same categories though they belong to different businesses. So, if several dentists share the same address, Google will only show one of them.\n\n== Hawk update ==\nAs previously explained (see above), the Possum update led similar listings, within the same building, or even located on the same street, to get filtered. As a result, only one listing \"with greater organic ranking and stronger relevance to the keyword\" would be shown.<ref name=hawk>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/august-22-2017-hawk-google-local-algorithm-update-282269|title=August 22, 2017: The day the 'Hawk' Google local algorithm update swooped in|date=2017-09-08|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref> After the Hawk update on 22 August 2017, this filtering seems to apply only to listings located within the same building or close by (e.g. 50 feet), but not to listings located further away (e.g.325 feet away).<ref name=hawk/>\n\n== Fake reviews ==\nAs previously explained (see above), reviews are deemed to be an important ranking factor. Joy Hawkins, a Google Top Contributor and local SEO expert, highlights the problems due to fake reviews:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/dear-google-4-suggestions-fixing-massive-problem-fake-reviews-276445|title=Dear Google: 4 suggestions for fixing your massive problem with fake reviews|date=2017-06-15|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Lack of an appropriate process for business owners to report fake reviews on competitors' sites. GMB support will not consider requests about businesses other than if they come from the business owners themselves. So if a [[competitor]] nearby has been collecting fake reviews, the only way to bring this to the attention of GMB is via the Google My Business Forum.\n* Unlike Yelp, Google does not show a label warning users of abnormal review behavior for those businesses that buy reviews or that receive unnatural numbers of negative reviews because of media attention. \n* Current Google algorithms do not identify unnatural review patterns. Abnormal review patterns often do not need human gauging and should be easily identified by algorithms. As a result, both fake listings and rogue reviewer profiles should be suspended.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Local search (optimization)]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Hence the authors suggest using such elements only if it makes sense for usability reasons.\n* The presence of a keyword in the business name was found to be one of the most important factors (explaining the high incidence of spam in the Local Pack).\n* Schema structured data is a ranking factor. The addition of the 'LocalBusiness' markup will enable you to display relevant information about your business to Google. This includes opening hours, address, founder, parent company information and much more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schema.org/LocalBusiness|title=LocalBusiness - schema.org|website=schema.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>\n*The number of reviews and overall star rating correlates with higher rankings in the Google map pack results.\n\n== Local ranking according to Google ==\nProminence, relevance, and distance are the three main criteria Google claims to use in its [[algorithms]] to show results that best match a user's query.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091|title=Improve your local ranking on Google - Google My Business Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>  \n* Prominence reflects how well-known is a place in the offline world. An important museum or store, for example, will be given more prominence. Google also uses information obtained on the web to assess prominence such as review counts, links, articles. \n* Relevance refers to Google's algorithms attempt to surface the listings that best match the user's query.  \n* Distance refers to Google's attempt to return those listings that are the closest the location terms used in a user's query. If no location term is used then \"Google will calculate distance based on what\u2019s known about their location\".\n\n== Local ranking: 2017 survey from 40 local experts ==\nAccording to a group of local SEO experts who took part in a survey, links and reviews are more important than ever to rank locally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/just-released-2017-local-search-ranking-factors-survey-results-273006|title=Just released: 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors survey results|date=2017-04-11|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Near Me Queries ==\nAs a result of both Google as well as Apple offering \"near me\" as an option to users, some authors<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/things-near-seo-268697|title='Things to do near me' SEO|date=2017-02-13|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref> report on how [[Google Trends]] shows very significant increases in \"near me\" queries. The same authors also report that the factors correlating the most with Local Pack ranking for \"near me\" queries include the presence of the \"searched city and state in backlinks' anchor text\" as well as the use of the \" 'near me' in internal link anchor text\"\n\n== Possum Update ==\nAn important update to Google's local algorithm, rolled out on the 1st of September 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/everything-need-know-googles-possum-algorithm-update-258900|title=Everything you need to know about Google's 'Possum' algorithm update|date=2016-09-21|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}</ref> Summary of the update on local search results:\n* Businesses based outside city physical limits showed a significant increase in ranking in the Google Local Pack\n* A more restrictive filter is in place. Before the update, Google filtered listings linking to the same [[website]] and using the same phone number. After the update, listings get filtered if they have the same address and same categories though they belong to different businesses. So, if several dentists share the same address, Google will only show one of them.\n\n== Hawk update ==\nAs previously explained (see above), the Possum update led similar listings, within the same building, or even located on the same street, to get filtered. As a result, only one listing \"with greater organic ranking and stronger relevance to the keyword\" would be shown.<ref name=hawk>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/august-22-2017-hawk-google-local-algorithm-update-282269|title=August 22, 2017: The day the 'Hawk' Google local algorithm update swooped in|date=2017-09-08|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref> After the Hawk update on 22 August 2017, this filtering seems to apply only to listings located within the same building or close by (e.g. 50 feet), but not to listings located further away (e.g.325 feet away).<ref name=hawk/>\n\n== Fake reviews ==\nAs previously explained (see above), reviews are deemed to be an important ranking factor. Joy Hawkins, a Google Top Contributor and local SEO expert, highlights the problems due to fake reviews:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/dear-google-4-suggestions-fixing-massive-problem-fake-reviews-276445|title=Dear Google: 4 suggestions for fixing your massive problem with fake reviews|date=2017-06-15|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Lack of an appropriate process for business owners to report fake reviews on competitors' sites. GMB support will not consider requests about businesses other than if they come from the business owners themselves. So if a [[competitor]] nearby has been collecting fake reviews, the only way to bring this to the attention of GMB is via the Google My Business Forum.\n* Unlike Yelp, Google does not show a label warning users of abnormal review behavior for those businesses that buy reviews or that receive unnatural numbers of negative reviews because of media attention. \n* Current Google algorithms do not identify unnatural review patterns. Abnormal review patterns often do not need human gauging and should be easily identified by algorithms. As a result, both fake listings and rogue reviewer profiles should be suspended.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Local search (optimization)]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Despite being a heavy underdog in his opponent's home country, Liddell dominated the [[vale tudo]] fighter on the feet, and won via decision. After a technical submission loss to top contender [[Jeremy Horn]] shortly after, Liddell began establishing his reputation as a top contender with dominant victories over [[Kevin Randleman]], [[Murilo Bustamante]], [[Vitor Belfort]], [[Amar Suloev]], [[Jeff Monson]], [[Renato Sobral]] and [[Tito Ortiz]]. Liddell was also the first UFC fighter to fight in [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]], where he represented the organization against fellow kickboxer [[Guy Mezger]], knocking him unconscious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/iceman-looking-for-the-final-revenge-2|title=Iceman Looking for the Final Revenge|last=Gobetz|first=Mitch|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture=====\n{{See also|Randy Couture vs. Chuck Liddell}}\nBy 2002, Liddell was considered the #1 contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, with growing popularity and support from his fans. The UFC tried to arrange a title bout with then-champion [[Tito Ortiz]], but Ortiz cited scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293|title=UFC 47 Profile: Tito Ortiz|first=Joe|last=Reilly|work=Wrestling101.com|date=March 9, 2004|accessdate=January 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302050932/http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293/|archive-date=March 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nTo force Ortiz's hand, they created an interim light heavyweight championship and matched Liddell with [[Greco-Roman]] wrestler and former heavyweight champion \"The Natural\" [[Randy Couture]] at ''[[UFC 43]]''. Couture neutralized Liddell's hooks with straight punches and eventually began taking \"The Iceman\" down at will. Couture eventually gained full [[Mount (grappling)|mount]] and forced a referee stoppage due to a barrage of punches.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n=====Pride Grand Prix Tournament against Overeem/Jackson=====\nAfter his defeat to Couture, Liddell entered the [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] 2003 Middleweight Grand Prix tournament as the official [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] representative. Liddell defeated [[Muay Thai]] specialist [[Alistair Overeem]] in the [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|first round of the tournament]]. In the action-packed bout, Liddell was getting out-landed by the taller, quicker and more technical striking of Overeem; later in the round Liddell landed an overhand punch to the head of Overeem, sending him staggering into the ropes. Liddell then rushed in with knees and straight rights and knocked Overeem out at the end of the first round. \n\nIn the next round, Liddell was eliminated by fan-favorite [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. In the first round of his fight with Jackson, Liddell landed shots as he found his distance but Jackson countered with powerful strikes, rocking Liddell numerous times. In the second round, Jackson continued to out-land Liddell with big punches, but could not finish him. Later in the second round a visibly exhausted Liddell was taken down and received a barrage of punches from the ground. His corner threw in the towel, giving Jackson the upset victory.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz=====\n{{See also|Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz}}\nReturning to the UFC, Liddell was once again in contention for the light heavyweight title, preparing for a match with former champion Tito Ortiz. Eventually, after Ortiz lost the title to Randy Couture, the two would meet in a highly anticipated bout at ''[[UFC 47]]'' on April 2, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada. After most of the first round was spent feeling each other out, Liddell threw a few punches and a kick which was blocked by Ortiz, with Ortiz slapping himself on the head, taunting Liddell. \n\nWhen the round ended Ortiz pushed referee [[Big John McCarthy|\"Big\" John McCarthy]] out of his way, into Liddell, and the pair exchanged words. Shortly after the second round started, Liddell landed a flurry of punches that dropped Ortiz and led to a TKO victory. Ortiz has since stated that Liddell's thumb made contact with his eye, causing him momentarily to see \"nothing but black\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/12/ortiz_looks_to_continue_challe.html |title=Ortiz looks to continue challenger trend |first=Jared |last=Barnes |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Since ''[[UFC 47]]'', the bad blood between both fighters remained, with Ortiz repeatedly stating that he wanted \"his\" title belt back. Despite the tension, Ortiz and Liddell would not fight again for two and a half years.\n\n====Continued success====\n=====''The Ultimate Fighter''=====\nIn early 2005, Liddell was a coach on the inaugural season of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', [[Spike TV]]'s reality show which featured fighters competing for a UFC contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chuck-liddell/person/314316/summary.html|title=Chuck Liddell: Summary|work=TV.com|date=May 26, 2007|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe coached Team Liddell, while then [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Randy Couture]] coached Team Couture.

Liddell's defensive [[wrestling]] ability, especially his [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]], stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on [[grappling]] and [[submission wrestling]]. \n\nLiddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee that he could not see. He had been hit with a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture III=====\nOn February 4, 2006, at ''[[UFC 57]]'', Liddell faced [[Randy Couture]] in a rubber match, After an action packed first round, Liddell landed a big punch to Couture's face causing him to bleed, Couture bounced back with a take down of Liddell, but he was able to get up right away. Later in the second round as Couture moved in Liddell countered similar to in the second fight at [[UFC 52]] knocking Couture out, defeating Couture for the second time via knockout in Las Vegas, Nevada, to retain the light heavyweight championship belt. After the fight, Couture announced his retirement from mixed martial arts.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Sobral II=====\nIn his next defense, at ''[[UFC 62]]'' on August 26, 2006, Liddell would beat [[Renato Sobral|Renato \"Babalu\" Sobral]], who he had defeated nearly three years prior. Seconds after the fight started Sobral came running forward throwing punches. Liddell, moving backwards, was landing big punches, and a right uppercut ended the fight at 1:35 of the first round. It was announced during ''[[UFC 61]]'' that, were he to defeat Sobral, Liddell would face off against [[List of Pride champions|PRIDE Middleweight Champion]] [[Wanderlei Silva]]. The fight failed to materialize due to the competing promotions' inability to reach an agreement. UFC president [[Dana White]] attributed this to Silva's subsequent knockout loss to [[Mirko Filipovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/09/liddellsilva_on_the_shelf_for.html |first=Jared |last=Barnes |title=Liddell-Silva on the shelf for now |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz II=====\nIn what was the most financially successful UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 66]]'', which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability, forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down at one point in the fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to defend his light heavyweight championship successfully for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell had torn his [[medial collateral ligament|MCL]] prior to the fight.

Liddell was knocked down by a right hook less than two minutes into the first round and was unable to defend himself against Jackson's strikes on the ground, resulting in a knockout victory for Jackson. After the loss, Liddell was widely criticized after reports indicated he had been seen in night clubs the week before the event.

Despite being a heavy underdog in his opponent's home country, Liddell dominated the [[vale tudo]] fighter on the feet, and won via decision. After a technical submission loss to top contender [[Jeremy Horn]] shortly after, Liddell began establishing his reputation as a top contender with dominant victories over [[Kevin Randleman]], [[Murilo Bustamante]], [[Vitor Belfort]], [[Amar Suloev]], [[Jeff Monson]], [[Renato Sobral]] and [[Tito Ortiz]]. Liddell was also the first UFC fighter to fight in [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]], where he represented the organization against fellow kickboxer [[Guy Mezger]], knocking him unconscious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/iceman-looking-for-the-final-revenge-2|title=Iceman Looking for the Final Revenge|last=Gobetz|first=Mitch|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture=====\n{{See also|Randy Couture vs. Chuck Liddell}}\nBy 2002, Liddell was considered the #1 contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, with growing popularity and support from his fans. The UFC tried to arrange a title bout with then-champion [[Tito Ortiz]], but Ortiz cited scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293|title=UFC 47 Profile: Tito Ortiz|first=Joe|last=Reilly|work=Wrestling101.com|date=March 9, 2004|accessdate=January 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302050932/http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293/|archive-date=March 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nTo force Ortiz's hand, they created an interim light heavyweight championship and matched Liddell with [[Greco-Roman]] wrestler and former heavyweight champion \"The Natural\" [[Randy Couture]] at ''[[UFC 43]]''. Couture neutralized Liddell's hooks with straight punches and eventually began taking \"The Iceman\" down at will. Couture eventually gained full [[Mount (grappling)|mount]] and forced a referee stoppage due to a barrage of punches.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n=====Pride Grand Prix Tournament against Overeem/Jackson=====\nAfter his defeat to Couture, Liddell entered the [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] 2003 Middleweight Grand Prix tournament as the official [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] representative. Liddell defeated [[Muay Thai]] specialist [[Alistair Overeem]] in the [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|first round of the tournament]]. In the action-packed bout, Liddell was getting out-landed by the taller, quicker and more technical striking of Overeem; later in the round Liddell landed an overhand punch to the head of Overeem, sending him staggering into the ropes. Liddell then rushed in with knees and straight rights and knocked Overeem out at the end of the first round. \n\nIn the next round, Liddell was eliminated by fan-favorite [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. In the first round of his fight with Jackson, Liddell landed shots as he found his distance but Jackson countered with powerful strikes, rocking Liddell numerous times. In the second round, Jackson continued to out-land Liddell with big punches, but could not finish him. Later in the second round a visibly exhausted Liddell was taken down and received a barrage of punches from the ground. His corner threw in the towel, giving Jackson the upset victory.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz=====\n{{See also|Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz}}\nReturning to the UFC, Liddell was once again in contention for the light heavyweight title, preparing for a match with former champion Tito Ortiz. Eventually, after Ortiz lost the title to Randy Couture, the two would meet in a highly anticipated bout at ''[[UFC 47]]'' on April 2, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada. After most of the first round was spent feeling each other out, Liddell threw a few punches and a kick which was blocked by Ortiz, with Ortiz slapping himself on the head, taunting Liddell. \n\nWhen the round ended Ortiz pushed referee [[Big John McCarthy|\"Big\" John McCarthy]] out of his way, into Liddell, and the pair exchanged words. Shortly after the second round started, Liddell landed a flurry of punches that dropped Ortiz and led to a TKO victory. Ortiz has since stated that Liddell's thumb made contact with his eye, causing him momentarily to see \"nothing but black\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/12/ortiz_looks_to_continue_challe.html |title=Ortiz looks to continue challenger trend |first=Jared |last=Barnes |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Since ''[[UFC 47]]'', the bad blood between both fighters remained, with Ortiz repeatedly stating that he wanted \"his\" title belt back. Despite the tension, Ortiz and Liddell would not fight again for two and a half years.\n\n====Continued success====\n=====''The Ultimate Fighter''=====\nIn early 2005, Liddell was a coach on the inaugural season of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', [[Spike TV]]'s reality show which featured fighters competing for a UFC contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chuck-liddell/person/314316/summary.html|title=Chuck Liddell: Summary|work=TV.com|date=May 26, 2007|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe coached Team Liddell, while then [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Randy Couture]] coached Team Couture. The series was a success for both Spike TV and the UFC. Both of the winners of the show, [[Diego Sanchez]] and [[Forrest Griffin]], were members of Team Liddell and went on to have very successful careers in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-kotc-and-k-1-salary-breakdown|title=UFC, KOTC, and K-1 Salary breakdown|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 11, 2005|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture II=====\nOn April 16, 2005, at ''[[UFC 52]]'', Liddell fought Randy Couture, again for the light heavyweight title. Couture moved in for a punch, Liddell countered with a big right hand to the temple of Couture, knocking him out cold, making him the new [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n[[File:ChuckLiddell.png|thumb|150 px|left|Liddell in 2007]]\n\n=====Liddell vs. Horn II=====\nLiddell was scheduled to defend his new title against longtime veteran [[Jeremy Horn]], at ''[[UFC 54]]'', a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sherdog.com|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chuck-Liddell-192|title=Fight Finder - Chuck \"Iceman\" Liddell's Mixed Martial Arts Statistics|work=Sherdog.com|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing [[Knockout#Knockdown|knockdown]]s in several rounds. Liddell's defensive [[wrestling]] ability, especially his [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]], stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on [[grappling]] and [[submission wrestling]]. \n\nLiddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee that he could not see. He had been hit with a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture III=====\nOn February 4, 2006, at ''[[UFC 57]]'', Liddell faced [[Randy Couture]] in a rubber match, After an action packed first round, Liddell landed a big punch to Couture's face causing him to bleed, Couture bounced back with a take down of Liddell, but he was able to get up right away. Later in the second round as Couture moved in Liddell countered similar to in the second fight at [[UFC 52]] knocking Couture out, defeating Couture for the second time via knockout in Las Vegas, Nevada, to retain the light heavyweight championship belt. After the fight, Couture announced his retirement from mixed martial arts.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Sobral II=====\nIn his next defense, at ''[[UFC 62]]'' on August 26, 2006, Liddell would beat [[Renato Sobral|Renato \"Babalu\" Sobral]], who he had defeated nearly three years prior. Seconds after the fight started Sobral came running forward throwing punches. Liddell, moving backwards, was landing big punches, and a right uppercut ended the fight at 1:35 of the first round. It was announced during ''[[UFC 61]]'' that, were he to defeat Sobral, Liddell would face off against [[List of Pride champions|PRIDE Middleweight Champion]] [[Wanderlei Silva]]. The fight failed to materialize due to the competing promotions' inability to reach an agreement. UFC president [[Dana White]] attributed this to Silva's subsequent knockout loss to [[Mirko Filipovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/09/liddellsilva_on_the_shelf_for.html |first=Jared |last=Barnes |title=Liddell-Silva on the shelf for now |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz II=====\nIn what was the most financially successful UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 66]]'', which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability, forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down at one point in the fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to defend his light heavyweight championship successfully for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell had torn his [[medial collateral ligament|MCL]] prior to the fight. He had also popped the tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand during the fight itself.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=18257\n|title=UFC Post-show Notes\n|last=Meltzer\n|first=Dave\n|authorlink=Dave Meltzer\n|work=[[Wrestling Observer|The Wrestling Observer]] website\n|date=December 31, 2006\n|accessdate=June 28, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n====Title loss and decline====\n\n=====Liddell vs. Jackson II=====\nIn his fifth defense, Liddell would lose the title at ''[[UFC 71]]'' on May 26, 2007, in a rematch with [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. Liddell was knocked down by a right hook less than two minutes into the first round and was unable to defend himself against Jackson's strikes on the ground, resulting in a knockout victory for Jackson.
