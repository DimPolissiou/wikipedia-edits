It was the band's third studio album released internationally and the fourth to be released in Australia. It was also the last AC/DC album to feature [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] on bass. It was originally released on 21 March 1977 in [[Australia]] on the [[Albert Productions]] label. A modified international edition was released on 25 July 1977 on [[Atlantic Records]].\n<br />\n\n==Background==\nIn late 1976 AC/DC were at a slump. \u201cIt was very close to being all over,\u201c manager Michael Browning said. \u201cThings were progressing very well in London and Europe. We\u2019d been through a whole thing with the Marquee where they broke all the house records. We\u2019d done the Lock Up Your Daughters UK tour and the Reading festival. It was all shaping up really well.\u201d\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wall |first1=Mick |title=Let There Be Rock: The album that saved AC/DC's career |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/let-there-be-rock-the-album-that-nearly-killed-ac-dc |website=Loudersound |publisher=Loudersound}}</ref>\nHaving moved the band and their operation to London over the previous eight months - during which time their first UK album release, [[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]], had served warning on an unsuspecting British music scene of the impending explosion of Antipodean rock coming their way - the band's sudden absence from the domestic scene in Australia had left AC/DC's live following there diminished. When Browning brought them back to Oz at the end of 1976 for what should have been a triumphant homecoming, they were surprised to discover that things had changed.\n\nThe young, mostly female crowd that had got to know them through regular appearances on TV shows like Countdown had deserted them in favour of stay-at-home poptastic local heroes like Skyhooks. Even the rugged fans who populated the thriving pub and club scene that AC/DC now found themselves back playing had developed a certain grudging attitude towards a band that had \u201cbuggered off overseas,\u201d as Browning puts it. Even their hometown crowd in Sydney was diminished: when, after their return home, the band headlined the 5,000-capacity Hordern Pavilion on December 12, the place was barely half-full.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough tour,\u201d Browning says. \u201cThe group didn\u2019t want to be doing it. I copped a lot of shit for making them do it. But it was a financial necessity. We had to do it to fill the coffers up to keep doing what we were doing in England and Europe. But try explaining that to a young rock\u2019n\u2019roll band.\u201d \u201cOur grassroots guys stayed with us,\u201d said AC/DC's then-bassist Mark Evans.\u201d But we got banned from a lot of gigs too. Angus was dropping his shorts, and we had a problem with the tour programme where there was a quote on top of my photograph which said \u2018I want to make enough money so I\u2019ll be able to fuck Britt Ekland.\u2019 That nearly derailed the whole tour.\u201d To make matters worse, Atlantic Records in the United States had rejected the band's third album [[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]], feeling the production was not up to par, and in fact were debating dropping the group from the label entirely.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the tour, I get a phone call saying Atlantic Records in America didn't like the Dirty Deeds album,\u201d says Browning. \u201cThat, in fact, they were going to drop the group from the label. And that\u2019s when things got really bad.\u201d Despite their precarious position, the band were typically bullish in their refusal to bow to the label.\n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cMalcolm\u2019s attitude was the opposite. Total disregard for what Americans think. That\u2019s been their attitude all the way along, which is what\u2019s made them so sustainable and huge, just never ever really compromising in situations like that.\u201d|sign=|source=Michael Browning}}\n\nThere was no question of them softening their sound to make it more palatable to the American market. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side it was decided the band should hurry back into the studio in Sydney and record a new album, before heading back to the UK. Thus, in January 1977, AC/DC entered Alberts Studios in Sydney, where all their records had been made up to that point, and spent two weeks recording what came to be known as Let There Be Rock. \n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cThere was always a siege mentality about that band. But once we all found out that Atlantic had knocked us back the attitude was: \u2018Fuck them! Who the fuck do they think they are?\u2019 So from that point onwards it was: \u2018Fuck, we\u2019ll show them!\u2019 We were seriously fucking pissed off about it. It didn\u2019t need to be discussed. We were going to go in and make that album and shove it up their arse!\u201d|sign=|source=Mark Evans}}\n\n==Recording==\nFrom the beginning, it appears they intended to make a statement, with guitarist Angus Young telling [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in 2000, \"Me and Malcolm said, 'Well, we really want a lot of guitars,' you know? Big guitars.\" The band's first album released in Australia, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'', had contained [[glam rock]] elements, while their ensuing releases had been recorded piecemeal as the group toured incessantly and were also altered for international release. ''Let There Be Rock'', on the other hand, was recorded in one go and represented a major evolution in the band's sound, with many critics and fans citing it as the first ''true'' AC/DC album. In his book ''Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott'', author Clinton Walker observes, \"''Let There Be Rock'' was the first fully rounded AC/DC album. The band had finally found itself.\"\n\n''Let There Be Rock'' was produced by the production team of [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] and [[Harry Vanda]], who had been at the helm of the band's previous albums (George was the older brother of Angus and Malcolm). According to Murray Engelheart's band memoir ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', the album was completed in roughly a two-week time frame. Rhythm and backing tracks were all completed in the first week. Bon, who'd be given cassettes of the mixed-down, vocal-less tracks which he then \u201cscribbled words to\u201d, did his vocals in the second week, during which Angus also laid down his guitar solos. In addition, the band also had a new approach to recording:\n\n{{quote|Malcolm had noticed that some rock acts, particularly those on the American stadium circuit, had realised the power to be had in slightly longer songs and tapping into extended solos and general guitar hijinks...the temptation to show the competition - the emerging punks on one hand and American soft rock on the other - how rock and roll was really done was too much...The studio set-up at Albert's was perfect for what was planned. All the amps were in the same room as the drums, which were positioned in the corner. The guitar sound spilt over into the vocal and drum microphones so a perfect precision recording was difficult, but that was part of the charm.}}\n\nThe result was far beyond anything the band had produced before in the studio. The band replicated their live sound, with literally explosive results; as recounted in Clifton Walker's ''Highway to Hell'', one of the most oft-repeated stories concerning AC/DC's studio methods emanates from these sessions: Angus' smoking amp during the recording of the album's final track, \"Whole Lotta Rosie\". As he was overdubbing the guitar solo, his amp began to fuse out and smoke began to fill the studio. George Young gestured wildly from behind the desk to keep going. \"There was no way,\" Walker quotes the producer, \"we were going to stop a shit-hot performance for a technical reason like amps blowing up!\" In a 1991 interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'', Angus recalled, \"The album on which we got to do the most guitar stuff was probably ''Let There Be Rock''. Throughout that album, there are many guitar solos and many breaks. I really like some of them very much. The song \"Let There Be Rock\" was unusual for me. I remember my brother, George, saying in the studio, 'C'mon Ang, let's get something different here'...I had great deal of fun on that whole album. On the last track, I remember the amp blowing up at the end. I said, 'Hey, the speakers are going!' You could see it in the studio, there was all this smoke and sparks, and the valves were glowing. He kept yelling at me, 'Keep playing, keep playing!'\" Another Oz band, The Angels, had recently signed to Albert Productions and were also being produced in the studio by Vanda and Young. Drummer Graham \u2018Buzz\u2019 Bidstrup recalls:\n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cIt was all to do with the feel, it wasn\u2019t about perfection. They would play the riff until George said: \u2018I think you\u2019ve got the groove there.\u2019 That might be five minutes, it might be 10. Remember, there\u2019s no drum machines, no click tracks, no nothing. They\u2019d just hammer at Phil Rudd.\u201d The only way the band knew how to record back then was simply to play as if they were doing a gig. \u201cIf Angus was recording a solo, he would be climbing all over the amps and rolling around the floor,\u201d says Bidstrup. \u201cThat was part of what made George and Harry good producers \u2013 they could actually get the band fired up to be so excited about what they were doing that Angus would crawl around on the floor.\u201d|sign=|source=}}\n\nIt was simply one of those albums, Angus concluded, \u201cwhere it was all cooking\u201d.\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', singer Bon Scott wrote the title track's lyrics in an office at Albert's with the help of a [[Bible]] from a nearby bookstore. The song provides an encapsulated, fictionalized version of the history of [[rock 'n' roll]]. Building on a line from the [[Chuck Berry]] song \"[[Roll Over Beethoven]]\": \"... tell [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] the news\", \"Let There Be Rock\" pays homage to Chuck Berry in the opening lines. the line \"but Tchaikovsky had the news\" actually means :\"Chuck Berry brought \"the Goods News\" (in other words the Gospel of Rock'n'Roll was written by Chuck Berry\"and he stated that in Roll Over Beethoven)\".  Following rock's birth, rock bands appeared everywhere, musicians found fame (while businesses made money off their efforts), and millions of people learned how to play [[electric guitar]]. The third and final verse speaks of a \"42-decibel\" rock band playing good, loud music in an establishment called \"The Shaking Hand\". This is usually changed to \"92-decibel\" in live versions of the song. In addition, ''light'' is correctly introduced before ''sound'', unlike on the studio version. After the final verse, the song ends with an extended solo by Angus, which consists mainly of fast picking, string bends, and hammer-ons. Band biographer Jesse Fink describes the song as \"six-and-a-bit minutes of beauty, chaos, precision and primal fire.{{sfn|Fink|2013|p=163}} A [[music video]] for \"Let There Be Rock\" was filmed in July 1977 (see [[1977 in music]]) in the Kirk Gallery church<ref name=\"early\">{{cite book|last1=Daniels|first1=Neil|last2=Scott|first2=Bon|title=AC/DC - The Early Years|isbn=9781906191245}}</ref> in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales]] and featured [[Bon Scott]], [[Angus Young]], [[Malcolm Young]], [[Phil Rudd]], and [[Cliff Williams]], who replaced [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] as the band's bassist shortly after the ''Let There Be Rock'' album was released. This marked one of Williams' first public appearances with AC/DC. Scott was dressed as a [[priest]] and the rest of the band as [[altar boy]]s, with Angus Young wearing a halo prop on his head. Towards the end of the video it shows Angus and the rest of the band jamming while he goes off on the guitar. In an alternate ending of the video, the colors are morphed and the camera zooms in on the stained glass window.<ref>Video Footage and Liner Notes, Family Jewels 2-Disc DVD Set 2005</ref> According to an interview with the Young brothers, Bon Scott injured himself in the final jump from the podium. \"Let There Be Rock\" was also released as a single in 1978, with a live version of the ''Let There Be Rock'' album track \"[[Dog Eat Dog (AC/DC song)|Dog Eat Dog]]\" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], which had been recorded in concert in [[Glasgow]] on 30 April 1978. When AC/DC was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2003, Scott's replacement [[Brian Johnson]] quoted the song \"Let There Be Rock\" in the band's acceptance speech.\n\n\"[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]\" is about an obese [[Tasmania]]n woman named Rosie, with whom the singer Scott had a one-night stand at the Freeway Gardens Motel in [[North Melbourne]].<ref>Bon Scott Interview, ''Bonfire'' Box Set, Disc 4</ref> In addition to pointing out the woman's size, the singer finds her to be one of the most talented lovers he's ever experienced. The song's first verse reveals Rosie's substantial physical measurements (42\"-39\"-56\"), and that she weighs nineteen [[stone (weight)|stone]] (266 pounds/approximately 120 kilograms). On the ''[[Live from the Atlantic Studios]]'' disc, however, Scott describes the titular woman as \"...a Tasmanian devil&nbsp;...weighs 305 pounds&nbsp;...,\" a measurement that differs from the \"19 stone\" lyric (305&nbsp;lb being 21&nbsp;st 11&nbsp;lb). In 1998, speaking to ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'' magazine, [[Angus Young]] remembered:<blockquote>We'd been in Tasmania and after the show [Bon Scott] said he was going to check out a few clubs. He said he'd got about 100 yards down the street when he heard this yell: 'Hey! Bon!' He looked around and saw this leg and thought: 'Oh well!' From what he said, there was this Rosie woman and a friend of hers. They were plying him with drinks and Rosie said to him: 'This month I've slept with 28 famous people,' and Bon went: 'Oh yeah?!' Anyway, in the morning he said he woke up pinned against the wall, he said he opened one eye and saw her lean over to her friend and whisper: '29!' There's very few people who'll go out and write a song about a big fat lady, but Bon said it was worthy.<ref>Ewing, Jerry. ''VOX'', February 1998. Albums. Re-issues. Blazer of Glory. AC/DC - Bonfire (EMI). P. 78</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe song's main riff was also featured on an earlier recording with different lyrics, titled \"Dirty Eyes\", which saw official release on ''[[Volts (album)|Volts]]'', part of the ''[[Bonfire (album)|Bonfire]]'' box set. \"Dirty Eyes\" features a different chord progression in the chorus and does not contain the \"band duel\" featured in \"Rosie\". In ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', Malcolm Young is quoted, \"We were always big fans of early rock and roll, like [[Elvis]] and '[[Heartbreak Hotel]],' things like that - the stop-and-start things, the dynamics. If anything, for 'Whole Lotta Rosie' we were looking for a feel like [[Little Richard]], a good steamin' rock feel, and see what we could lay on top with the guitars. It evoked that, but you're just looking for the vibe, what's exciting, and that's what we were listening to. Simple to put together, but still around like a classic.\"\n\nAccording to the 1994 Bon Scott biography ''Highway to Hell'', the album's opening track \"Go Down\" was inspired by \"supergroupie\" Ruby Lips.\n\n\"Overdose\", which features an extended introduction that showcases the symbiotic guitar relationship between the Young brothers, was inspired by a woman named Judy King. The lyrics equate a man overdosing on a woman like an addict would overdose on drugs, with Scott singing, \"You're a habit I don't want to break.\"  Whether or not the song had any meaning beyond the metaphor is subject to speculation; by all accounts, Scott was a hard drinker and indulged in drugs. In 2013, keyboardist John Bisset of [[Fraternity]] (Scott's band before AC/DC) told ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''{{'s}} Peter Watts: \"We were drinkers. We got into [[marijuana]], [[mescaline]] and [[mushrooms]], but [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was the mainstay...He drank heaps.  He drank until he could barely stand. But he always remained the same person.\" According to Jesse Fink's book ''The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC'', former bassist Mark Evans reveals that Scott overdosed on [[heroin]] in 1975 and was nearly fired from the band: \"There were some doubts about Bon at that stage. He'd had a problem or he'd had an OD very early on. It was just a dabble...Bon made a bad decision. It was only one bad decision. From what I was led to believe and came to believe, it was a very, very isolated incident.\"\n\n\"Dog Eat Dog\", a song about humanity's cutthroat nature, was released as a single in Australia, and included the non-album track \"Carry Me Home\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], which was later released on ''[[Backtracks (AC/DC album)|Backtracks]]''. The band would perform the single frequently in concert, as well as the album tracks \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\" and \"Bad Boy Boogie\", the latter accompanying Angus Young's infamous striptease routine.\n\nThe original [[gramophone record|vinyl]] version of the album released for international markets contained the same track list as the original Australian release but [[Atlantic Records]] removed the racy song \"Crabsody in Blue\" (about the problems of [[Crab louse|crabs]]) from later pressings of the international version. It was subsequently replaced with a shortened version of the song \"Problem Child\" from the Australian version of the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (album)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', which was originally released in September 1976. \"Crabsody In Blue\" was later released on the box set ''[[Backtracks (AC/DC album)|Backtracks]]''.\n\nAll international CD releases contain the modified track listing from the later [[gramophone record|vinyl]] pressings of the international version.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe Australian cover features the fingers of guitarist Chris Turner, from Australian band [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]]. \"There was a bloke called Colin Stead, who was in Buffalo for about ten minutes,\" Turner recalled. \"He was also the centrefold photographer for ''[[Playboy]]''. He phoned me up and said he was doing the album cover for ''Let There Be Rock'', but AC/DC were out of town, so could I help out? He wanted a flash guitar run up and down the neck. Apparently, when he saw it, Angus said, 'He's got fat fingers, hasn't he?'\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mick|last=[[Mick Wall|Wall]]|title=Let there be light! Let there be sound!

Oh yeah, it also kicks unholy ass!\" David Fricke of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote of the album in a 2008 cover story, \"AC/DC's early albums were perfectly frenetic, but inconsistent.

It was the band's third studio album released internationally and the fourth to be released in Australia. It was also the last AC/DC album to feature [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] on bass. It was originally released on 21 March 1977 in [[Australia]] on the [[Albert Productions]] label. A modified international edition was released on 25 July 1977 on [[Atlantic Records]].\n<br />\n\n==Background==\nIn late 1976 AC/DC were at a slump. \u201cIt was very close to being all over,\u201c manager Michael Browning said. \u201cThings were progressing very well in London and Europe. We\u2019d been through a whole thing with the Marquee where they broke all the house records. We\u2019d done the Lock Up Your Daughters UK tour and the Reading festival. It was all shaping up really well.\u201d\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wall |first1=Mick |title=Let There Be Rock: The album that saved AC/DC's career |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/let-there-be-rock-the-album-that-nearly-killed-ac-dc |website=Loudersound |publisher=Loudersound}}</ref>\nHaving moved the band and their operation to London over the previous eight months - during which time their first UK album release, [[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]], had served warning on an unsuspecting British music scene of the impending explosion of Antipodean rock coming their way - the band\u2019s sudden absence from the domestic scene in Australia had left AC/DC\u2019s live following there diminished. When Browning brought them back to Oz at the end of 1976 for what should have been a triumphant homecoming, they were surprised to discover that things had changed.\n\nThe young, mostly female crowd that had got to know them through regular appearances on TV shows like Countdown had deserted them in favour of stay-at-home poptastic local heroes like Skyhooks. Even the rugged fans who populated the thriving pub and club scene that AC/DC now found themselves back playing had developed a certain grudging attitude towards a band that had \u201cbuggered off overseas,\u201d as Browning puts it. Even their hometown crowd in Sydney was diminished: when, after their return home, the band headlined the 5,000-capacity Hordern Pavilion on December 12, the place was barely half-full.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough tour,\u201d Browning says. \u201cThe group didn\u2019t want to be doing it. I copped a lot of shit for making them do it. But it was a financial necessity. We had to do it to fill the coffers up to keep doing what we were doing in England and Europe. But try explaining that to a young rock\u2019n\u2019roll band.\u201d \u201cOur grassroots guys stayed with us,\u201d said AC/DC\u2018s then-bassist Mark Evans.\u201d But we got banned from a lot of gigs too. Angus was dropping his shorts, and we had a problem with the tour programme where there was a quote on top of my photograph which said \u2018I want to make enough money so I\u2019ll be able to fuck Britt Ekland.\u2019 That nearly derailed the whole tour.\u201d To make matters worse, Atlantic Records in the United States had rejected the band's third album [[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]], feeling the production was not up to par, and in fact were debating dropping the group from the label entirely.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the tour, I get a phone call saying Atlantic Records in America didn't like the Dirty Deeds album,\u201d says Browning. \u201cThat, in fact, they were going to drop the group from the label. And that\u2019s when things got really bad.\u201d Despite their precarious position, the band were typically bullish in their refusal to bow to the label.\n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cMalcolm\u2019s attitude was the opposite. Total disregard for what Americans think. That\u2019s been their attitude all the way along, which is what\u2019s made them so sustainable and huge, just never ever really compromising in situations like that.\u201d|sign=|source=Michael Browning}}\n\nThere was no question of them softening their sound to make it more palatable to the American market. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side it was decided the band should hurry back into the studio in Sydney and record a new album, before heading back to the UK. Thus, in January 1977, AC/DC entered Alberts Studios in Sydney, where all their records had been made up to that point, and spent two weeks recording what came to be known as Let There Be Rock. \n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cThere was always a siege mentality about that band. But once we all found out that Atlantic had knocked us back the attitude was: \u2018Fuck them! Who the fuck do they think they are?\u2019 So from that point onwards it was: \u2018Fuck, we\u2019ll show them!\u2019 We were seriously fucking pissed off about it. It didn\u2019t need to be discussed. We were going to go in and make that album and shove it up their arse!\u201d|sign=|source=Mark Evans}}\n\n==Recording==\nFrom the beginning, it appears they intended to make a statement, with guitarist Angus Young telling [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in 2000, \"Me and Malcolm said, 'Well, we really want a lot of guitars,' you know? Big guitars.\" The band's first album released in Australia, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'', had contained [[glam rock]] elements, while their ensuing releases had been recorded piecemeal as the group toured incessantly and were also altered for international release. ''Let There Be Rock'', on the other hand, was recorded in one go and represented a major evolution in the band's sound, with many critics and fans citing it as the first ''true'' AC/DC album. In his book ''Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott'', author Clinton Walker observes, \"''Let There Be Rock'' was the first fully rounded AC/DC album. The band had finally found itself.\"\n\n''Let There Be Rock'' was produced by the production team of [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] and [[Harry Vanda]], who had been at the helm of the band's previous albums (George was the older brother of Angus and Malcolm). According to Murray Engelheart's band memoir ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', the album was completed in roughly a two-week time frame. Rhythm and backing tracks were all completed in the first week. Bon, who\u2019d be given cassettes of the mixed-down, vocal-less tracks which he then \u201cscribbled words to\u201d, did his vocals in the second week, during which Angus also laid down his guitar solos. In addition, the band also had a new approach to recording:\n\n{{quote|Malcolm had noticed that some rock acts, particularly those on the American stadium circuit, had realised the power to be had in slightly longer songs and tapping into extended solos and general guitar hijinks...the temptation to show the competition - the emerging punks on one hand and American soft rock on the other - how rock and roll was really done was too much...The studio set-up at Albert's was perfect for what was planned. All the amps were in the same room as the drums, which were positioned in the corner. The guitar sound spilt over into the vocal and drum microphones so a perfect precision recording was difficult, but that was part of the charm.}}\n\nThe result was far beyond anything the band had produced before in the studio. The band replicated their live sound, with literally explosive results; as recounted in Clifton Walker's ''Highway to Hell'', one of the most oft-repeated stories concerning AC/DC's studio methods emanates from these sessions: Angus' smoking amp during the recording of the album's final track, \"Whole Lotta Rosie\". As he was overdubbing the guitar solo, his amp began to fuse out and smoke began to fill the studio. George Young gestured wildly from behind the desk to keep going. \"There was no way,\" Walker quotes the producer, \"we were going to stop a shit-hot performance for a technical reason like amps blowing up!\" In a 1991 interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'', Angus recalled, \"The album on which we got to do the most guitar stuff was probably ''Let There Be Rock''. Throughout that album, there are many guitar solos and many breaks. I really like some of them very much. The song \"Let There Be Rock\" was unusual for me. I remember my brother, George, saying in the studio, 'C'mon Ang, let's get something different here'...I had great deal of fun on that whole album. On the last track, I remember the amp blowing up at the end. I said, 'Hey, the speakers are going!' You could see it in the studio, there was all this smoke and sparks, and the valves were glowing. He kept yelling at me, 'Keep playing, keep playing!'\" Another Oz band, The Angels, had recently signed to Albert Productions and were also being produced in the studio by Vanda and Young. Drummer Graham \u2018Buzz\u2019 Bidstrup recalls:\n\n{{Quote|text=\u201cIt was all to do with the feel, it wasn\u2019t about perfection. They would play the riff until George said: \u2018I think you\u2019ve got the groove there.\u2019 That might be five minutes, it might be 10. Remember, there\u2019s no drum machines, no click tracks, no nothing. They\u2019d just hammer at Phil Rudd.\u201d The only way the band knew how to record back then was simply to play as if they were doing a gig. \u201cIf Angus was recording a solo, he would be climbing all over the amps and rolling around the floor,\u201d says Bidstrup. \u201cThat was part of what made George and Harry good producers \u2013 they could actually get the band fired up to be so excited about what they were doing that Angus would crawl around on the floor.\u201d|sign=|source=}}\n\nIt was simply one of those albums, Angus concluded, \u201cwhere it was all cooking\u201d.\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', singer Bon Scott wrote the title track's lyrics in an office at Albert's with the help of a [[Bible]] from a nearby bookstore. The song provides an encapsulated, fictionalized version of the history of [[rock 'n' roll]]. Building on a line from the [[Chuck Berry]] song \"[[Roll Over Beethoven]]\": \"... tell [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] the news\", \"Let There Be Rock\" pays homage to Chuck Berry in the opening lines. the line \"but Tchaikovsky had the news\" actually means :\"Chuck Berry brought \"the Goods News\" (in other words the Gospel of Rock'n'Roll was written by Chuck Berry\"and he stated that in Roll Over Beethoven)\".  Following rock's birth, rock bands appeared everywhere, musicians found fame (while businesses made money off their efforts), and millions of people learned how to play [[electric guitar]]. The third and final verse speaks of a \"42-decibel\" rock band playing good, loud music in an establishment called \"The Shaking Hand\". This is usually changed to \"92-decibel\" in live versions of the song. In addition, ''light'' is correctly introduced before ''sound'', unlike on the studio version. After the final verse, the song ends with an extended solo by Angus, which consists mainly of fast picking, string bends, and hammer-ons. Band biographer Jesse Fink describes the song as \"six-and-a-bit minutes of beauty, chaos, precision and primal fire.{{sfn|Fink|2013|p=163}} A [[music video]] for \"Let There Be Rock\" was filmed in July 1977 (see [[1977 in music]]) in the Kirk Gallery church<ref name=\"early\">{{cite book|last1=Daniels|first1=Neil|last2=Scott|first2=Bon|title=AC/DC - The Early Years|isbn=9781906191245}}</ref> in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales]] and featured [[Bon Scott]], [[Angus Young]], [[Malcolm Young]], [[Phil Rudd]], and [[Cliff Williams]], who replaced [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] as the band's bassist shortly after the ''Let There Be Rock'' album was released. This marked one of Williams' first public appearances with AC/DC. Scott was dressed as a [[priest]] and the rest of the band as [[altar boy]]s, with Angus Young wearing a halo prop on his head. Towards the end of the video it shows Angus and the rest of the band jamming while he goes off on the guitar. In an alternate ending of the video, the colors are morphed and the camera zooms in on the stained glass window.<ref>Video Footage and Liner Notes, Family Jewels 2-Disc DVD Set 2005</ref> According to an interview with the Young brothers, Bon Scott injured himself in the final jump from the podium. \"Let There Be Rock\" was also released as a single in 1978, with a live version of the ''Let There Be Rock'' album track \"[[Dog Eat Dog (AC/DC song)|Dog Eat Dog]]\" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], which had been recorded in concert in [[Glasgow]] on 30 April 1978. When AC/DC was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2003, Scott's replacement [[Brian Johnson]] quoted the song \"Let There Be Rock\" in the band's acceptance speech.\n\n\"[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]\" is about an obese [[Tasmania]]n woman named Rosie, with whom the singer Scott had a one-night stand at the Freeway Gardens Motel in [[North Melbourne]].<ref>Bon Scott Interview, ''Bonfire'' Box Set, Disc 4</ref> In addition to pointing out the woman's size, the singer finds her to be one of the most talented lovers he's ever experienced. The song's first verse reveals Rosie's substantial physical measurements (42\"-39\"-56\"), and that she weighs nineteen [[stone (weight)|stone]] (266 pounds/approximately 120 kilograms). On the ''[[Live from the Atlantic Studios]]'' disc, however, Scott describes the titular woman as \"...a Tasmanian devil&nbsp;...weighs 305 pounds&nbsp;...,\" a measurement that differs from the \"19 stone\" lyric (305&nbsp;lb being 21&nbsp;st 11&nbsp;lb). In 1998, speaking to ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'' magazine, [[Angus Young]] remembered:<blockquote>We'd been in Tasmania and after the show [Bon Scott] said he was going to check out a few clubs. He said he'd got about 100 yards down the street when he heard this yell: 'Hey! Bon!' He looked around and saw this leg and thought: 'Oh well!' From what he said, there was this Rosie woman and a friend of hers. They were plying him with drinks and Rosie said to him: 'This month I've slept with 28 famous people,' and Bon went: 'Oh yeah?!' Anyway, in the morning he said he woke up pinned against the wall, he said he opened one eye and saw her lean over to her friend and whisper: '29!' There's very few people who'll go out and write a song about a big fat lady, but Bon said it was worthy.<ref>Ewing, Jerry. ''VOX'', February 1998. Albums. Re-issues. Blazer of Glory. AC/DC - Bonfire (EMI). P. 78</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe song's main riff was also featured on an earlier recording with different lyrics, titled \"Dirty Eyes\", which saw official release on ''[[Volts (album)|Volts]]'', part of the ''[[Bonfire (album)|Bonfire]]'' box set. \"Dirty Eyes\" features a different chord progression in the chorus and does not contain the \"band duel\" featured in \"Rosie\". In ''AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll'', Malcolm Young is quoted, \"We were always big fans of early rock and roll, like [[Elvis]] and '[[Heartbreak Hotel]],' things like that - the stop-and-start things, the dynamics. If anything, for 'Whole Lotta Rosie' we were looking for a feel like [[Little Richard]], a good steamin' rock feel, and see what we could lay on top with the guitars. It evoked that, but you're just looking for the vibe, what's exciting, and that's what we were listening to. Simple to put together, but still around like a classic.\"\n\nAccording to the 1994 Bon Scott biography ''Highway to Hell'', the album's opening track \"Go Down\" was inspired by \"supergroupie\" Ruby Lips.\n\n\"Overdose\", which features an extended introduction that showcases the symbiotic guitar relationship between the Young brothers, was inspired by a woman named Judy King. The lyrics equate a man overdosing on a woman like an addict would overdose on drugs, with Scott singing, \"You're a habit I don't want to break.\"  Whether or not the song had any meaning beyond the metaphor is subject to speculation; by all accounts, Scott was a hard drinker and indulged in drugs. In 2013, keyboardist John Bisset of [[Fraternity]] (Scott's band before AC/DC) told ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''{{'s}} Peter Watts: \"We were drinkers. We got into [[marijuana]], [[mescaline]] and [[mushrooms]], but [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was the mainstay...He drank heaps.  He drank until he could barely stand. But he always remained the same person.\" According to Jesse Fink's book ''The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC'', former bassist Mark Evans reveals that Scott overdosed on [[heroin]] in 1975 and was nearly fired from the band: \"There were some doubts about Bon at that stage. He'd had a problem or he'd had an OD very early on. It was just a dabble...Bon made a bad decision. It was only one bad decision. From what I was led to believe and came to believe, it was a very, very isolated incident.\"\n\n\"Dog Eat Dog\", a song about humanity's cutthroat nature, was released as a single in Australia, and included the non-album track \"Carry Me Home\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], which was later released on ''[[Backtracks (AC/DC album)|Backtracks]]''. The band would perform the single frequently in concert, as well as the album tracks \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\" and \"Bad Boy Boogie\", the latter accompanying Angus Young's infamous striptease routine.\n\nThe original [[gramophone record|vinyl]] version of the album released for international markets contained the same track list as the original Australian release but [[Atlantic Records]] removed the racy song \"Crabsody in Blue\" (about the problems of [[Crab louse|crabs]]) from later pressings of the international version. It was subsequently replaced with a shortened version of the song \"Problem Child\" from the Australian version of the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (album)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', which was originally released in September 1976. \"Crabsody In Blue\" was later released on the box set ''[[Backtracks (AC/DC album)|Backtracks]]''.\n\nAll international CD releases contain the modified track listing from the later [[gramophone record|vinyl]] pressings of the international version.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe Australian cover features the fingers of guitarist Chris Turner, from Australian band [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]]. \"There was a bloke called Colin Stead, who was in Buffalo for about ten minutes,\" Turner recalled. \"He was also the centrefold photographer for ''[[Playboy]]''. He phoned me up and said he was doing the album cover for ''Let There Be Rock'', but AC/DC were out of town, so could I help out? He wanted a flash guitar run up and down the neck. Apparently, when he saw it, Angus said, 'He's got fat fingers, hasn't he?'\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mick|last=[[Mick Wall|Wall]]|title=Let there be light! Let there be sound!

The near-epic title track to what is widely regarded as the best Bon Scott-era album, the song is a holy testimony, bringing good news to all those who believe in the healing power of rock & roll - amen! Oh yeah, it also kicks unholy ass!\" David Fricke of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote of the album in a 2008 cover story, \"AC/DC's early albums were perfectly frenetic, but inconsistent. Their second U.S. LP was almost all killer. Scott sings 'Bad Boy Boogie' and 'Problem Child' like he's the ''enfant terrible''...Angus' solos are true white heat.\" [[Amazon.com]] calls the [[LP album|LP]] \"a break from the early 'novelty' approach to songwriting and a move to the more focused album-oriented view that the band would perfect.\" In 2006, AC/DC biographer Murray Engleheart wrote that ''Let There Be Rock'' \"elevated AC/DC to the status of an album band, something that had previously been the exclusive domain of the likes of [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].\" In 2000, Angus Young recalled to ''[[Guitar World]]'' that producer [[Mutt Lange]] once told him \"of all the many albums we'd done with my brother George and his partner, Harry Vanda, the one Mutt wished he would have done, where he was envious of George, was ''Let There Be Rock''.\" Band biographer Jesse Fink writes, \"Wherever AC/DC ended up in the annals of rock history, this album would stand for all time as an expression of their unrivaled might as a guitar band.\"{{sfn|Fink|2013|p=148}}\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===Australian version===\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side one\n| all_writing     = [[Angus Young]], [[Malcolm Young]] and [[Bon Scott]]\n| title1          = Go Down\n| length1         = 5:31\n| title2          = [[Dog Eat Dog (AC/DC song)|Dog Eat Dog]]\n| length2         = 3:35\n| title3          = [[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]\n| length3         = 6:06\n| title4          = Bad Boy Boogie\n| length4         = 4:27\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title5          = Overdose\n| length5         = 6:09\n| title6          = Crabsody in Blue\n| length6         = 4:44\n| title7          = Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\n| length7         = 4:14\n| title8          = [[Whole Lotta Rosie]]\n| length8         = 5:24\n}}\n\n===International version===\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side one\n| title1          = Go Down\n| length1         = 5:31\n| title2          = Dog Eat Dog\n| length2         = 3:35\n| title3          = Let There Be Rock\n| length3         = 6:06\n| title4          = Bad Boy Boogie\n| length4         = 4:27\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = Problem Child\n| length1         = 5:25\n| title2          = Overdose\n| length2         = 6:09\n| title3          = Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\n| length3         = 4:14\n| title4          = Whole Lotta Rosie\n| length4         = 5:24\n}}\n\n*Track 5, \"Problem Child\", was originally released on ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (Australian album)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'' in 1976.

Gypsum blocks are composed of gypsum, [[plaster]], water and in some cases additives like vegetable or wood fiber for greater strength. Partition walls, made from gypsum blocks, require no sub-structure for erection and gypsum adhesive is used as bonding agent, not standard mortar. Because of this fundamental difference, gypsum blocks shouldn't be confused with the thinner [[plasterboard]] (also known as wallboard or gypsum board) used for paneling stud walls.\n\n[[File:Gipswandbauplatten.JPG|thumb|Construction of a non-load bearing partition wall of gypsum blocks]]\n\n==Manufacture==\nA gypsum block is made of gypsum plaster and water. The manufacturing process <ref name=EurC1>{{cite web|last = Ecofys|last2 = Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research|last3 = \u00d6ko-Institut|title = Methodology for the free allocation of emission allowances in the EU ETS post 2012.

This process is also called [[calcination]]. The plaster is then mixed with water, stirred and poured into molds to form gypsum blocks with standard formats, either solid, or with round or square open cores to reduce weight and conserve materials. Each block is moulded with [[tongue and groove]] at all sides, to enable quick and easy assembly. Still wet, the gypsum blocks are taken out of the molds and put into drying chambers. The dried gypsum blocks are packaged at the production plant and then transported to warehouses or construction sites.\n\n==Specifications==\nGypsum blocks are manufactured in accordance with the European and British EN 12859 Standard. The dimensions of European standard gypsum blocks are: length: 666&nbsp;mm, height: 500&nbsp;mm. Three blocks thus make 1 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nGypsum blocks vary in thickness, [[density]] and type. In the U.S. gypsum blocks were made in 2\", 3\", 4\" and 6\" thicknesses.<ref name=GBT1>{{cite book|last=Escherich|first=Susan M.|title=Gypsum Block and Tile. Twentieth-century Building Materials: History and Conservation|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=168\u2013172}}</ref> In Europe they are available in thicknesses of 60&nbsp;mm, 70&nbsp;mm, 80&nbsp;mm or 100&nbsp;mm. In European residential buildings regularly 80 or 100&nbsp;mm thick gypsum blocks are being used.\n\nFor construction purposes especially two densities are important:\n\n*the medium gross density of 850&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1.100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (white coloured blocks, suitable for standard usage)\n*the high gross density blocks of 1.100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1.500&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (reddish colour, suitable for walls with higher acoustic performance requirements)\n\nThe dimensions of these blocks are: length 500&nbsp;mm, height 500&nbsp;mm. Four blocks thus make 1 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nFor wet areas like domestic kitchens, bathrooms and cellars [[water-repellent]] hydro blocks (mostly with a bluish colour) are available, both in medium and high gross density.\n\n==Properties==\nGypsum blocks combine the advantages of classical [[masonry]] with modern [[drywall]] construction. Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, void-free and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like drywalls. To distinguish this kind of construction from conventional drywalls with wall studs and gypsum panels or gypsum fiber boards, the construction with gypsum blocks is often referred to as massive drywall construction.\n\nDue to the grammage of about 54&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 120&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, non-bearing partition walls out of gypsum blocks fall into the category of lightweight partition walls.

Gypsum blocks are composed of gypsum, [[plaster]], water and in some cases additives like vegetable or wood fiber for greater strength. Partition walls, made from gypsum blocks, require no sub-structure for erection and gypsum adhesive is used as bonding agent, not standard mortar. Because of this fundamental difference, gypsum blocks shouldn't be confused with the thinner [[plasterboard]] (also known as wallboard or gypsum board) used for paneling stud walls.\n\n[[File:Gipswandbauplatten.JPG|thumb|Construction of a non-load bearing partition wall of gypsum blocks]]\n\n==Manufacture==\nA gypsum block is made of gypsum plaster and water.

This process is also called [[calcination]]. The plaster is then mixed with water, stirred and poured into molds to form gypsum blocks with standard formats, either solid, or with round or square open cores to reduce weight and conserve materials. Each block is moulded with [[tongue and groove]] at all sides, to enable quick and easy assembly. Still wet, the gypsum blocks are taken out of the molds and put into drying chambers. The dried gypsum blocks are packaged at the production plant and then transported to warehouses or construction sites.\n\n==Specifications==\nGypsum blocks are manufactured in accordance with the European and British EN 12859 Standard. The dimensions of European standard gypsum blocks are: length: 666&nbsp;mm, height: 500&nbsp;mm. Three blocks thus make 1 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nGypsum blocks vary in thickness, [[density]] and type. In the U.S. gypsum blocks were made in 2\", 3\", 4\" and 6\" thicknesses.<ref name=GBT1>{{cite book|last=Escherich|first=Susan M.|title=Gypsum Block and Tile. Twentieth-century Building Materials: History and Conservation|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=168\u2013172}}</ref> In Europe they are available in thicknesses of 60&nbsp;mm, 70&nbsp;mm, 80&nbsp;mm or 100&nbsp;mm. In European residential buildings regularly 80 or 100&nbsp;mm thick gypsum blocks are being used.\n\nFor construction purposes especially two densities are important:\n\n*the medium gross density of 850&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1.100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (white coloured blocks, suitable for standard usage)\n*the high gross density blocks of 1.100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1.500&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (reddish colour, suitable for walls with higher acoustic performance requirements)\n\nThe dimensions of these blocks are: length 500&nbsp;mm, height 500&nbsp;mm. Four blocks thus make 1 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nFor wet areas like domestic kitchens, bathrooms and cellars [[water-repellent]] hydro blocks (mostly with a bluish colour) are available, both in medium and high gross density.\n\n==Properties==\nGypsum blocks combine the advantages of classical [[masonry]] with modern [[drywall]] construction. Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, void-free and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like drywalls. To distinguish this kind of construction from conventional drywalls with wall studs and gypsum panels or gypsum fiber boards, the construction with gypsum blocks is often referred to as massive drywall construction.\n\nDue to the grammage of about 54&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 120&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, non-bearing partition walls out of gypsum blocks fall into the category of lightweight partition walls. Due to the construction technique they are stable solid walls with a high resistance to mechanical strain, which reduces maintenance and repair.\n\n==Fire resistance rating==\nGypsum is a [[mineral]] and non-combustible building material (a class A1 building material in accordance with the German DIN 4102, the European EN 13501 or the British BS 476 or the American ASTM E119) consisting of calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O).
