The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket.

A female militia leader ate 6 human livers in total, and cut the genitals of 5 men and soaked them in alcohol which she would drink later, claiming that these organs were beneficial to her health. The behavior of eating human flesh, hearts and livers occurred in many counties of Guangxi including Wuxuan, [[Wuming District|Wuming]], [[Shangsi County|Shangsi]], Guigang, [[Qinzhou]], [[Guiping]], and [[Lingyun County|Lingyun]]......After the \"Committee of Revolution\" was established in Shangsi County, a \"killing conference\" was held at Pingshan Square ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u5e73\u5c71\u5e7f\u573a}}) on September 1, 1968, during which more than 10 officials and civilians were beaten to death.

There was one man who was said to be in the so-called fifth category, who was beaten to death where he stood. He had two kids, one of 11 and one of 14. The local officials and armed militia said that it was important to eradicate such people, and so they not only killed those two children: they ate them too. This took place in [[Pubei County|Pubei county]], Guangxi, where 35 people were killed and eaten in total. Most of them were rich landowners and their families. There was one landowner called Liu Zhengjian whose entire family was wiped out. He had a 17-year-old daughter, Liu Xiulan, who was gang-raped by nine people [for 19 times] who then ripped open her belly, and ate her liver and breasts.

By the 1840s and 1850s, white settlers began hay, grain, and livestock operations in what would become eastern Multnomah County. Railroad tracks extended to the area by the 1890s, and, as the population grew, residents began referring to the locale as Fairview because of the pleasing views of the nearby river, the [[Columbia River Gorge]], and [[Mount Hood]]. Since another community named Fairview already existed on the [[Oregon Coast]], the community's first post office was named Cleone until the coastal post office closed and the name was transferred to Fairview.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fairview Comprehensive Plan |publisher=City of Fairview |date=June 2004 |format=PDF |url=http://www.ci.fairview.or.us/Final_Comp_Plan-2004_updates.pdf |page=1 |access-date=December 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081744/http://www.ci.fairview.or.us/Final_Comp_Plan-2004_updates.pdf |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s the city attempted to annex a large section of unincorporated territory in eastern Multnomah County.<ref name=\"new city\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U7koAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vYYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=fairview%3Den&pg=6813%2C3598846|title=Court tosses out vote on new city|last=UPI|date=September 18, 1985|work=The Bulletin|page=A4|accessdate=April 15, 2010|location=Bend, Oregon}}</ref> The plan would have created a city of about 120,000 residents, which at the time would have ranked as the second most populous city in Oregon, behind only Portland.<ref name=\"new city\"/> In September 1985, the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] ruled that the attempt was invalid as state law required two cities to start any attempt at consolidation, and only Fairview had initiated this attempt.<ref name=\"new city\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.58|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|3.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 204\n|1920= 184\n|1930= 266\n|1940= 305\n|1950= 438\n|1960= 578\n|1970= 1045\n|1980= 1749\n|1990= 2391\n|2000= 7561\n|2010= 8920\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9319\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\"/>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 8,920 people, 3,544 households, and 2,274 families residing in the city.
