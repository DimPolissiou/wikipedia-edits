Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

He hit his stride as a daring, resourceful and courageous leader.  He picked up [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], his family, and his immediate staff, who had been ordered to flee the Philippines, and took them aboard [[PT 41]] and other {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} motor torpedo boats through over {{convert|600|nmi|km|sigfig=1}} of open ocean. On arriving at [[Mindanao]], MacArthur said, \"You have taken me out of the jaws of death. I shall never forget it.\"  Bulkeley earned many of his array of decorations while in command of that squadron and a subsequent one. He was evacuated to Australia by [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] in the final days of the campaign.\n\nIn September 1942, while in the States helping to raise War Bonds as a lieutenant commander, he met former Ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy at New York's Plaza Hotel, and shortly after was instrumental in recruiting Lieutenant John F. Kennedy into the Navy's Motor Torpedo Boat Training Center (MTBTC) at Mellville, Rhode Island.<ref>Doyle, William, \"PT 109\", (2015) Harper-Collins Publishers, New York City, pp. 29\u201333.</ref>  Kennedy's heroic captaining of the PT 109 would help to launch his first campaign for Congress.\n\nIn 1944, he took part in the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]. Bulkeley led torpedo boats and minesweepers in clearing the lanes to [[Utah Beach]],<ref name=NYT/> keeping German [[E-boat]]s from attacking the landing ships along the Mason Line, and picking up wounded sailors from the sinking minesweeper {{USS|Tide|AM-125}}, destroyer escort {{USS|Rich|DE-695}}, and destroyer {{USS|Corry|DD-463}}.  As invasion operations wound down, he received command of his first large ship, the destroyer {{USS|Endicott|DD-495}}.  One month after D-Day, he [[Battle of La Ciotat|came to the aid]] of two British gunboats under attack by two German [[corvette]]s.  Bulkeley's vessel largest gun was smaller than the guns on the German ship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}  After days of fighting, Bulkeley only had one working gun on his ship.  Charging in with only one gun working, he engaged both enemy vessels at point-blank range, sinking both.  Afterwards, Bulkeley rescued the British sailors in the water and then rescued many of the German sailors as well.  When asked, he explained, \"What else could I do? You engage, you fight, you win.  That is the reputation of our Navy, then and in the future.\"\n\n==Cold War==\nDuring the [[Korean War]] in 1952, Bulkeley commanded Destroyer Division 132.  After the war, he was Chief of Staff for Cruiser Division Five.<ref name=SNA>{{Cite web\n|accessdate=2007-10-19\n|url=http://www.navysna.org/awards/Hall%20of%20Fame%20Write%20Ups/Bulkeley.htm\n|title=Vice Admiral John D.

Having lost none of his wartime daring, Bulkeley was known to test the alertness of the Marines guarding the base by donning a ninja suit, blackening his face and endeavoring to penetrate the classified area after dark without detection.  This was a dangerous endeavor, as the Marines carried loaded weapons.  Ever popular with his men, who both respected and admired him, Bulkeley could be seen driving around the base in his fire-engine red [[Triumph TR3]] sports car with a large silver PT boat as a hood ornament.\n\nPromoted to Rear Admiral by President [[John F. Kennedy]], who commanded [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]] during World War&nbsp;II, Bulkeley was dispatched to command the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in [[Cuba]],<ref name=\"NYT\"/> where he met Cuba's threat to sever water supplies in response to the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] and other assaults by ordering the installation of desalinization equipment to make the base self-sufficient.  Bulkeley commanded Guantanamo Bay from December 1963 to August 1966.  A section of the Guantanamo Naval Station is named Camp Bulkeley in his honor.\n\nFamously, when Castro accused the Americans of stealing water from Cuba, Bulkeley ordered that the main water pipe entering the base from Cuba, near the Northeast Gate, have a section cut out of it.  He mailed one piece of the severed pipe section to the Smithsonian Institution as an historic artifact and then mailed the other half to Castro. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/18/archives/irate-admiral-cuts-guantanamo-mains.html</ref>\n\n==Last years==\nBulkeley retired from active duty in 1975. However, he was recalled to active duty in a retired-retained status in order to serve as the commander of the Navy's [[Board of Inspection and Survey]] (INSURV) which conducts inspections and surveys of U.S. naval vessels before their commissioning and deployment.<ref>Among the ships Bulkeley inspected was {{USS|Samuel B.

The remarkable achievement of LCDR Bulkeley's command in damaging or destroying a notable number of Japanese enemy planes, surface combatant and merchant ships, and in dispersing landing parties and land-based enemy forces during the 4 months and 8 days of operation without benefit of repairs, overhaul, or maintenance facilities for his squadron, is believed to be without precedent in this type of warfare. His dynamic forcefulness and daring in offensive action, his brilliantly planned and skillfully executed attacks, supplemented by a unique resourcefulness and ingenuity, characterize him as an outstanding leader of men and a gallant and intrepid seaman. These qualities coupled with a complete disregard for his own personal safety reflect great credit upon him and the Naval Service.<ref name=ArmyMOHsite>{{Cite web\n |accessdate=2004-09-11 \n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html \n |title=Medal of Honor recipients, WWII, A\u2013F \n |publisher=U.S. Army \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616211617/http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html \n |archivedate=16 June 2008 \n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[New Jersey Route 57|Route 57]] in [[Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey]], is named the \"Admiral John D.

He hit his stride as a daring, resourceful and courageous leader.  He picked up [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], his family, and his immediate staff, who had been ordered to flee the Philippines, and took them aboard [[PT 41]] and other {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} motor torpedo boats through over {{convert|600|nmi|km|sigfig=1}} of open ocean. On arriving at [[Mindanao]], MacArthur said, \"You have taken me out of the jaws of death. I shall never forget it.\"  Bulkeley earned many of his array of decorations while in command of that squadron and a subsequent one. He was evacuated to Australia by [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] in the final days of the campaign.\n\nIn September 1942, while in the States helping to raise War Bonds as a lieutenant commander, he met former Ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy at New York's Plaza Hotel, and shortly after was instrumental in recruiting Lieutenant John F. Kennedy into the Navy's Motor Torpedo Boat Training Center (MTBTC) at Mellville, Rhode Island.<ref>Doyle, William, \"PT 109\", (2015) Harper-Collins Publishers, New York City, pp. 29\u201333.</ref>  Kennedy's heroic captaining of the PT 109 would help to launch his first campaign for Congress.\n\nIn 1944, he took part in the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]. Bulkeley led torpedo boats and minesweepers in clearing the lanes to [[Utah Beach]],<ref name=NYT/> keeping German [[E-boat]]s from attacking the landing ships along the Mason Line, and picking up wounded sailors from the sinking minesweeper {{USS|Tide|AM-125}}, destroyer escort {{USS|Rich|DE-695}}, and destroyer {{USS|Corry|DD-463}}.  As invasion operations wound down, he received command of his first large ship, the destroyer {{USS|Endicott|DD-495}}.  One month after D-Day, he [[Battle of La Ciotat|came to the aid]] of two British gunboats under attack by two German [[corvette]]s.  Bulkeley's vessel largest gun was smaller than the guns on the German ship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}  After days of fighting, Bulkeley only had one working gun on his ship.  Charging in with only one gun working, he engaged both enemy vessels at point-blank range, sinking both.  Afterwards, Bulkeley rescued the British sailors in the water and then rescued many of the German sailors as well.  When asked, he explained, \"What else could I do? You engage, you fight, you win.  That is the reputation of our Navy, then and in the future.\"\n\n==Cold War==\nDuring the [[Korean War]] in 1952, Bulkeley commanded Destroyer Division 132.  After the war, he was Chief of Staff for Cruiser Division Five.<ref name=SNA>{{Cite web\n|accessdate=2007-10-19\n|url=http://www.navysna.org/awards/Hall%20of%20Fame%20Write%20Ups/Bulkeley.htm\n|title=Vice Admiral John D.

Having lost none of his wartime daring, Bulkeley was known to test the alertness of the Marines guarding the base by donning a ninja suit, blackening his face and endeavoring to penetrate the classified area after dark without detection.  This was a dangerous endeavor, as the Marines carried loaded weapons.  Ever popular with his men, who both respected and admired him, Bulkeley could be seen driving around the base in his fire-engine red [[Triumph TR3]] sports car with a large silver PT boat as a hood ornament.\n\nPromoted to Rear Admiral by President [[John F. Kennedy]], who commanded [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]] during World War&nbsp;II, Bulkeley was dispatched to command the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in [[Cuba]],<ref name=\"NYT\"/> where he met Cuba's threat to sever water supplies in response to the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] and other assaults by ordering the installation of desalinization equipment to make the base self-sufficient.\n\n==Last years==\nBulkeley retired from active duty in 1975. However, he was recalled to active duty in a retired-retained status in order to serve as the commander of the Navy's [[Board of Inspection and Survey]] (INSURV) which conducts inspections and surveys of U.S. naval vessels before their commissioning and deployment.<ref>Among the ships Bulkeley inspected was {{USS|Samuel B.

Bulkeley]]\nBulkeley's Medal of Honor citation reads:\n<blockquote>For extraordinary heroism, distinguished service, and conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty as commander of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three|Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3]], in Philippine waters during the period {{Nowrap|7 December}} 1941 to {{Nowrap|10 April}} 1942. The remarkable achievement of LCDR Bulkeley's command in damaging or destroying a notable number of Japanese enemy planes, surface combatant and merchant ships, and in dispersing landing parties and land-based enemy forces during the 4 months and 8 days of operation without benefit of repairs, overhaul, or maintenance facilities for his squadron, is believed to be without precedent in this type of warfare. His dynamic forcefulness and daring in offensive action, his brilliantly planned and skillfully executed attacks, supplemented by a unique resourcefulness and ingenuity, characterize him as an outstanding leader of men and a gallant and intrepid seaman. These qualities coupled with a complete disregard for his own personal safety reflect great credit upon him and the Naval Service.<ref name=ArmyMOHsite>{{Cite web\n |accessdate=2004-09-11 \n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html \n |title=Medal of Honor recipients, WWII, A\u2013F \n |publisher=U.S. Army \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616211617/http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html \n |archivedate=16 June 2008 \n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[New Jersey Route 57|Route 57]] in [[Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey]], is named the \"Admiral John D.

Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\" <ref name=\"Stu-interview\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/galahad Interview with Stu Nicholson], by Grande Rock.</ref>\n\nFounder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017.

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

In the previous meeting, Ohio State defeated Michigan for the fourth consecutive year, winning 42\u201313.<ref name=OhioStateNotes>{{cite news|title=Postgame Notes: #2 Ohio State 30, #3 Michigan 27 (2OT)|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112616aaa.html}}</ref>\n\nIn this year's game, the #2 Ohio State Buckeyes (11\u20131, 8\u20131) defeated the #3 Michigan Wolverines (10\u20132, 7\u20132) by a score of 30\u201327 in double overtime. After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State. The game marked the 11th time that Michigan and Ohio State took the field both in the nation's top-five rankings; and is just the second time that both programs were ranked in the nation's top three. The other was the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in [[2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|2006]] at Ohio Stadium. The game also marked the first overtime in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry. Michigan's defense recorded a season-best eight sacks against Ohio State. It is the program's most since posting nine against [[2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] on September 15, 2007. The Wolverines have recorded at least three sacks in each of the last four games. Wide receiver Amara Darboh surpassed the 2,000-yard receiving milestone in the contest. Darboh caught eight passes for 68 receiving yards, upping his career total to 2,026. Darboh has recorded a reception in 32 consecutive games, earning a share of the fourth spot among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category. He is tied with [[Marquise Walker]] (1998\u20132001).<ref name=OhioStateNotes/>\n\n[[Raekwon McMillan]] was named the conference Defensive Player of the Week for his performance.

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

Ohio State struck first, midway through the first quarter on a [[Curtis Samuel]] 36-yard touchdown run. On Oklahoma's next possession, Ohio State's Jerome Baker intercepted [[Baker Mayfield]]'s pass to score a touchdown on a 68-yard interception return. This was Ohio State's fourth defensive score in their first three games. During the ensuing kickoff, Oklahoma's Joe Mixon returned the kick for a 97-yard touchdown, to make the score 14\u20137, Ohio State. Though not caught, Mixon dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line and fumbled into the end zone. Ohio State scored another two touchdowns and Oklahoma made a field goal to make the score 28\u201310. With six minutes to go in the half, Oklahoma scored on a 35-yard Mayfield pass to A.D.

The Buckeye offense drove 75 yards to end the first half on a behind-the-back grab by [[Noah Brown]] to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201317 halftime advantage.\n\nOhio State scored on their opening possession of the half with Noah Brown's school record tying fourth touchdown reception.

In the previous meeting, Ohio State defeated Michigan for the fourth consecutive year, winning 42\u201313.<ref name=OhioStateNotes>{{cite news|title=Postgame Notes: #2 Ohio State 30, #3 Michigan 27 (2OT)|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112616aaa.html}}</ref>\n\nIn this year's game, the #2 Ohio State Buckeyes (11\u20131, 8\u20131) defeated the #3 Michigan Wolverines (10\u20132, 7\u20132) by a score of 30\u201327 in double overtime. After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State. The game marked the 11th time that Michigan and Ohio State took the field both in the nation's top-five rankings; and is just the second time that both programs were ranked in the nation's top three. The other was the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in [[2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|2006]] at Ohio Stadium. The game also marked the first overtime in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry. Michigan's defense recorded a season-best eight sacks against Ohio State. It is the program's most since posting nine against [[2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] on September 15, 2007. The Wolverines have recorded at least three sacks in each of the last four games. Wide receiver Amara Darboh surpassed the 2,000-yard receiving milestone in the contest. Darboh caught eight passes for 68 receiving yards, upping his career total to 2,026. Darboh has recorded a reception in 32 consecutive games, earning a share of the fourth spot among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category. He is tied with [[Marquise Walker]] (1998\u20132001).<ref name=OhioStateNotes/>\n\n[[Raekwon McMillan]] was named the conference Defensive Player of the Week for his performance. He recorded a career-tying 16 tackles, including seven solo stops.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|330\n|310\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|219\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|206\n|91\n|-\n|Penalties\n|2\u20136\n|7\u201359\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|28:47\n|31:13\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.
