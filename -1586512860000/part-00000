It is mainly known for its well-preserved, heavily fortified medieval [[defensive wall|town wall]] and [[half-timbered]] houses.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nB\u00fcdingen is in the south of the [[Wetterau]] below the [[Vogelsberg]] hills at an altitude of approx. 160 meters. The city is situated 15&nbsp;km northwest of [[Gelnhausen]] and about 40&nbsp;km east from [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Historically, the city belongs to [[Oberhessen]].\n\n===Geology===\nB\u00fcdingen is situated in a wet and swampy valley. The castle and the old town therefore rest on centuries-old oak planks, placed horizontally across vertical beech [[deep foundation|piles]] (poles). The water level has to be kept high enough so that no air can reach these foundations.\n\n===Districts===\nSince 1972, the municipality includes the following formerly independent villages: Aulendiebach, B\u00fcches, B\u00fcdingen (core or centre), Calbach, Diebach am Haag, D\u00fcdelsheim (the largest municipality), Dudenrod, Eckartshausen, Lorbach, Michelau, Orleshausen, Rinderb\u00fcgen, Rohrbach, Vonhausen, Wolf, and Wolferborn.\n\nIn the same year, the district (''Landkreis'') of B\u00fcdingen was dissolved, and B\u00fcdingen and the district of Friedberg formed the ''[[Wetteraukreis]]'', with [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] becoming the new district capital.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Buedingen Untertor1.jpg|thumb|\"Jerusalem Gate\" (or \"lower gate\").]]\n[[File:Buedingen grosses Bollwerk.jpg|thumb|''Das gro\u00dfe Bollwerk''.]]\n[[File:Buedingen Muehltorbruecke.jpg|thumb|''M\u00fchltorbr\u00fccke''.]]\n[[File:B\u00fcdingen, das Schlaghaus in straatzicht positie2 foto4 2016-08-09 17.22.jpg|Schlaghaus|thumb]]\n\nAround 700 the wooden church of [[Saint Remigius]] was built by an unknown lord. In 847 a \"B\u00fcdingen\" was named in a document for the first time, but it is not clear which B\u00fcdingen was meant, because there are some other smaller towns with the same name in Germany and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. An additional floor was added to St. Remigius's church in about 1050 and the building has basically remained unchanged since then.\n\nIn 1131 the House of B\u00fcdingen were mentioned for the first time. They became [[Graf|Burggrafen]] of [[Gelnhausen]] in 1155. The ''villa'' ({{lang-la|city}}) B\u00fcdingen was officially mentioned in 1206. The ruling House of B\u00fcdingen died out with Gerlach II before 1247.\n\nTheir heirs were the houses of Hohenlohe-Brauneck, of Isenburg-Kempenich, of Trimberg, of Hohenlohe and of Isenburg. On 26 July 1330, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] granted the status of a [[market town]] to Luther of B\u00fcdingen.\n\nWith his edict of liberty in 1353, Burggraf Heinrich II granted freedom and some independence to the people of B\u00fcdingen. In return the people had to defend the city, so the Marksmen's Society was founded. This society still exists today as one of the oldest rifle associations in Germany.\n\nSince 1442 the masters of B\u00fcdingen have been known as [[Graf]]en of Isenburg-B\u00fcdingen. After a local war, Graf Ludwig II built an enormous new defensive wall with 22 towers around the old stronghold between 1480 and 1510. These walls are still nearly completely extant and they are one of the most important medieval fortifications in Germany.\n\nIn 1521, [[Martin Luther]] allegedly passed through. In the same year, the town became [[Protestantism|Protestant]], later to become [[Calvinism|Calvinist]].\n\nIn 1576, the [[Black Death]] killed many inhabitants, as it did again in 1632.\n\nIn 1590, a great fire destroyed many buildings.\n\nBetween 1633 and 1634 114 people were victims of [[Witch-hunt|witch hunting]], although the first prosecutions took place in 1567. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], in 1634, the town was taken by Imperial troops, who defeated the Swedish occupants.\n\nIn 1578 Emperor [[Rudolf II]] rewarded the Grafen/Counts of B\u00fcdingen with the \"Jubilate\"-market (from the Latin word jubilate: \"to praise\"); an occasion for feasting. In 1806 the County of Ysenburg-B\u00fcdingen was annexed to the Principality of Isenburg-Birstein. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Principality of Isenburg was divided in 1816 between the [[Grand Duchy of Hessen|Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt]] and the [[Electorate of Hessen]]; B\u00fcdingen went to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1840, Graf Ernst Casimir III was promoted by a decree of the Grand Duke to the status of hereditary prince.\n\nIn 1601 Graf Wolfgang Ernst founded the Latin School, known today as the Wolfgang-Ernst-Gymnasium. In 1712 Graf Ernst Casimir I issued an edict of tolerance permitting religious dissenters to settle in B\u00fcdingen. As a result, by 1724 there was a suburb at the Lower Gate (Jerusalem Gate) where [[Huguenot]]s, [[Waldensians]], [[sectarian]]s, and other [[Separation of church and state|separationist]]s lived.\n\nIn 1822, administration and justice were split in the Grand-Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. B\u00fcdingen became seat of the B\u00fcdingen counties lawcourt, which was followed in 1852 by the installation of the [[Landkreis|district]] of B\u00fcdingen. In 1839, the laborers' school (later called the trade school) was founded. The Mathildenhospital was built between 1867 and 1868. In 1879, a [[credit union]] (today the ''Volksbank''), was founded. In 1936 B\u00fcdingen became a garrison town; U.S. troops were stationed there since 1945. The last American troops (1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment) departed B\u00fcdingen on 15 August 2007, ending 71 years of town history as a military garrison.\n\nMail service between B\u00fcdingen and [[Frankfurt am Main]] began in 1739: one mail coach and two mounted messengers a week. The [[Gie\u00dfen\u2013Gelnhausen railway]], including [[B\u00fcdingen (Oberhess) station|B\u00fcdingen station]] was opened between B\u00fcdingen and [[Gelnhausen]] on 30 November 1870. In 1879 the new [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] was built, including a [[gym]] and the principal's residence. Between 1888 and 1895 built a water main and began partial installation of a sewage system. The municipal gas works was established in 1910, and B\u00fcdingen received electric light in 1913.\n\n==Trivia==\n* B\u00fcdingen was the home to the 1st Squadron, [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] (1-1 CAV), the Division Cavalry unit for the [[United States Army]]'s [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n* B\u00fcdingen was formerly the home to the 3rd Squadron, [[U.S. 12th Cavalry Regiment]] (3-12 CAV), the Division Cavalry unit for the [[United States Army]]'s [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] from 1957 to 1989. In February 1989 it was reflagged as the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry.

[[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.

Some of those who wrote in Pashto are [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]] (a major inventor of the [[Pashto alphabet]]), [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], and [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the [[Durrani Empire]].\n\nIn modern times, noticing the incursion of Persian and Arabic vocabulary, there is a strong desire to \"[[Linguistic purism|purify]]\" Pashto by restoring its old vocabulary.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdTJgCSPsGwC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=pashto+purification#v=onepage&q=pashto%20purification&f=false |title=Afghanistan 101: Understanding Afghan Culture |author=Ehsan M Entezar |page=89 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4257-9302-9}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}<ref name=\"BensonKosonen2013\">{{cite book|author1=Carol Benson|author2=Kimmo Kosonen|title=Language Issues in Comparative Education: Inclusive Teaching and Learning in Non-Dominant Languages and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdREAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-218-1|pages=64\u2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hewad.com/mohammadgul/ Muhammad Gul Khan Momand], Hew\u0101d Afghanistan</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main article|Pashto grammar}}\nPashto is a [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV) language with [[split ergativity]]. [[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

and the \"hard\" northern variety ''Pax\u030ct\u014d'' (Pakhtu).<ref name=\"T&F\"/> Each variety is further divided into a number of dialects. The southern dialect of [[Wanetsi]] is the most distinctive Pashto dialect.\n\n1.

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.

His interest in folk music began at the age of 19. When he returned to Ireland, he performed in the [[Gate Theatre]] with John Molloy and soon went into the music business full-time, after holding a number of short-term jobs&mdash;including one at the [[Dublin]]'s telephone exchange. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 1962, he founded the Ronnie Drew Group with [[Luke Kelly]], [[Barney McKenna]] and [[Ciar\u00e1n Bourke]]. They soon changed their name to [[The Dubliners]]&mdash;with [[John Sheahan]] joining shortly afterwards to form the definitive line-up&mdash;and quickly became one of the best known Irish folk groups. They played at first in [[O'Donoghue's Pub]] in Merrion Row, Dublin 2 where they were often accompanied by Mary Jordan on the spoons and vocalist Ann Mulqueen, a friend of McKenna's. Mary Jordan's mother, Peggy Jordan, introduced them to the Abbey Tavern in Howth, which became a regular Monday night venue for the emerging group. They also played across the road in the Royal Hotel, at all-night parties in Peggy's large house in Kenilworth Square in [[Rathgar]], and in John Molloy's flat at Ely Place.\n\nDrew left the Dubliners in 1974.  He rejoined in 1979, but then left for good in 1995, though he did reunite with the group in 2002 for a 40th anniversary celebration. He made several television appearances with the group between 2002\u201305. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFrom 1995 onwards, Drew pursued a solo career.

He did a number of \"one-man shows\"&mdash;he was accompanied by various guitarists&mdash;during this period, such as ''Songs and Stories'', ''Ronnie, I Hardly Knew Ya'' and ''Ronnie''.

A number of clubs from the border region to [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], along the river [[Iller]], play in the W\u00fcrttemberg league system, the most successful of those being [[SpVgg Au/Iller]], [[FV Illertissen]] and the [[SpVgg Lindau]]. Both Viktoria Aschaffenburg and FV Illertissen returned to the Bavarian league system from 2012 onwards, taking advantage of the opportunity to play in the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]].\n\nAll up, 75 clubs from the Bavarian region of Swabia play in the W\u00fcrttemberg league system, 45 of those in the Donau/Iller region, the remainder spread over other border regions of the ''WFV''.

The Bavarian FA's definition of an amateur is a player who is not paid for its participation in a game and receives no more than \u20ac249.99 per month in compensations. It also sub-divides professionals in contracted players and licensed players. A contracted player is a player who is a member of a club who also receives payments in excess of \u20ac250 while a licensed player is a full professional.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 3 Status der Spieler</ref>\n\nThe ''BFV'' clearly defines the season as starting on 1 July of a year and finishing on 30 June the following year. It prohibits matches to be played in January, unless they are held indoors.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 6 Spieljahr</ref>\n\nEvery club competing in the league system must have a certain number of junior teams, depending on which league they play in, with the clubs in the Landesliga and Bayernliga having to have the most, three.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 8 Weitere Zulassungsvoraussetzungen</ref> Every club must also provide one referee per senior team it fields.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 9 Schiedsrichtergestellung</ref>\n\nThe ''BFV'' stipulates that leagues at the fourth to sixth tier of the league system have to have a nominal strength of 18 teams, leagues below of 16 teams, also this can fluctuate with promotion and relegation. It also dictates a specific league name for every tier.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 11 Spielklassen und Spielgruppen</ref> Up to the Kreisklasse, the fourth-lowest tier, first and second teams can play at the same level, but not in the same league.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 12 Untere Mannschaften</ref>\n\nUnlike most other football associations in Germany, Bavaria did not use the goal difference to determine league positions if two or more teams are on equal points on a rank of importance in the final standings. Should two or more teams be on equal points when a championship, promotion or relegation rank was considered, the teams had to play deciders. However, this rule was temporarily out of force in 2011-12 because of the large number of deciders already required to determine the make up of the future league system after 2012 with its major changes.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 14 Feststellung des Meisters</ref> Since then the goal difference has been used on higher league levels while lower levels were given the option of select which method they wish to use.\n\nAll league champions within the Bavarian league system have the right for direct promotion. Should a club decline promotion, the right gets passed on to the next-placed team, to a maximum of the fourth placed side in the final standings.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 16 Allgemeine Vorschriften</ref>\n\nShould a club declare insolvency during a season its first team will be automatically relegated to the next league below. Reserve teams or youth side are not affected by this but should it have a women's team in a league higher than the men's team, the women's team would be relegated instead.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 41 a Verein in Insolvenz</ref>\n\nShould a player compete for a professional team of a club, he or she can not be used in the reserve team for up to 10 days. This rule however does not apply for Under-23 players, which is why many reserve sides of professional clubs play as Under-23 sides.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 44 Einsatz in verschiedenen Mannschaften</ref>\n\nIn the Kreisligas and below, substituted players can be reused during a game. This is not possible in leagues above this level.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 46 Auswechslung/R\u00fcckwechseln von Spielern</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''100 Jahre S\u00fcddeutscher Fussball-Verband - SFV'', {{in lang|de}} publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1996\n* ''50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband - BFV'', {{in lang|de}} publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1995\n* [http://www.bfv.de/cms/docs/Spielordnung_ab_11.09.2017.pdf ''Spielordnung''] {{in lang|de}} BFV website - Rules of the game (September 2017)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.dfb.de/start German FA website] {{in lang|de|en}}\n* [http://www.suedfv.de/ Southern German FA website] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.bfv.de/cms/index.html Bavarian FA website] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Football in Bavaria}}\n{{German state football associations}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Football in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Football governing bodies in Germany]]\n[[Category:1945 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Organization\n|name         = Bavarian Football Association\n|image        = Bayerischer Fussballverband.svg\n|image_border = \n|size         = \n|caption      = \n|abbreviation = \n|motto        = \n|formation    = 1 June 1946<ref>[https://www.dfb.de/datencenter/vereine/1482 Fu\u00dfballverband Bayern] dfb.de</ref>\n|type         = Football association\n|headquarters = ''Haus des Fu\u00dfballs''<br />Brienner Stra\u00dfe 50\n|location     = [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]] \n|coords       = \n|membership   = 1,602,807 <small>(2017)</small>\n|leader_title = [[President (corporate title)|President]]\n|leader_name  = Dr. [[Rainer Koch]]\n|parent_organization = [[German Football Association]]\n|website      = [http://www.bfv.de/cms/seiten/index.html www.bfv.de]\n}}\n\nThe '''Bavarian Football Association''' ({{lang-de|Bayerischer Fussball-Verband}}), the ''BFV'', is one of 21 regional organisations of the [[German Football Association]], the ''DFB'', and covers the state of [[Bavaria]].<ref name=\"Regional\" >[https://www.dfb.de/verbandsstruktur/landes-regionalverbaende Regional Associations] ''DFB'' website - Map and details of the regional associations, accessed: 29 July 2011</ref> It was formed as an independent association on 4 February 1949 but its origins date back to 1945.<ref name=\"Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband p. 25\">''50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband'', p. 25</ref>\n\nThe Bavarian FA is also part of the [[Southern German Football Association]], the ''SFV'', one of five regional federations in [[Germany]].<ref name=\"Regional\" /> The other members of the ''SFV'' are the football associations of [[Baden Football Association|Baden]], [[Hessian Football Association|Hesse]], [[South Baden Football Association|South Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg Football Association|W\u00fcrttemberg]].

In late 2010, the idea was floated that those clubs could be forced to return to the Bavarian league system but this idea was dropped again.<ref>[http://www.swp.de/ulm/sport/fussball/regional/Umzug-nach-Bayern-ist-vom-Tisch;art4280,768111 Umzug nach Bayern ist vom Tisch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007154919/http://www.swp.de/ulm/sport/fussball/regional/Umzug-nach-Bayern-ist-vom-Tisch%3Bart4280%2C768111 |date=7 October 2011 }} {{in lang|de}} ''[[S\u00fcdwest Presse]]'', published: 16 December 2010, accessed: 3 August 2011</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules of the game in Bavaria, the ''Spielordnung'', has a number of special clauses that, at times, differ from the standard frame work of the ''DFB''.<ref>[http://www.bfv.de/cms/docs/Spielordnung_ab_11.09.2017.pdf ''Spielordnung''] {{in lang|de}} BFV website - Rules of the game, published: 11 September 2017, accessed: 30 March 2018</ref>\n\nThe ''BFV'' categorises players in three groups, amateurs, contracted players and licensed players. The Bavarian FA's definition of an amateur is a player who is not paid for its participation in a game and receives no more than \u20ac249.99 per month in compensations. It also sub-divides professionals in contracted players and licensed players. A contracted player is a player who is a member of a club who also receives payments in excess of \u20ac250 while a licensed player is a full professional.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 3 Status der Spieler</ref>\n\nThe ''BFV'' clearly defines the season as starting on 1 July of a year and finishing on 30 June the following year. It prohibits matches to be played in January, unless they are held indoors.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 6 Spieljahr</ref>\n\nEvery club competing in the league system must have a certain number of junior teams, depending on which league they play in, with the clubs in the Landesliga and Bayernliga having to have the most, three.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 8 Weitere Zulassungsvoraussetzungen</ref> Every club must also provide one referee per senior team it fields.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 9 Schiedsrichtergestellung</ref>\n\nThe ''BFV'' stipulates that leagues at the fourth to sixth tier of the league system have to have a nominal strength of 18 teams, leagues below of 16 teams, also this can fluctuate with promotion and relegation. It also dictates a specific league name for every tier.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 11 Spielklassen und Spielgruppen</ref> Up to the Kreisklasse, the fourth-lowest tier, first and second teams can play at the same level, but not in the same league.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 12 Untere Mannschaften</ref>\n\nUnlike most other football associations in Germany, Bavaria did not use the goal difference to determine league positions if two or more teams are on equal points on a rank of importance in the final standings. Should two or more teams be on equal points when a championship, promotion or relegation rank was considered, the teams had to play deciders. However, this rule was temporarily out of force in 2011-12 because of the large number of deciders already required to determine the make up of the future league system after 2012 with its major changes.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 14 Feststellung des Meisters</ref> Since then the goal difference has been used on higher league levels while lower levels were given the option of select which method they wish to use.\n\nAll league champions within the Bavarian league system have the right for direct promotion. Should a club decline promotion, the right gets passed on to the next-placed team, to a maximum of the fourth placed side in the final standings.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 16 Allgemeine Vorschriften</ref>\n\nShould a club declare insolvency during a season its first team will be automatically relegated to the next league below. Reserve teams or youth side are not affected by this but should it have a women's team in a league higher than the men's team, the women's team would be relegated instead.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 41 a Verein in Insolvenz</ref>\n\nShould a player compete for a professional team of a club, he or she can not be used in the reserve team for up to 10 days. This rule however does not apply for Under-23 players, which is why many reserve sides of professional clubs play as Under-23 sides.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 44 Einsatz in verschiedenen Mannschaften</ref>\n\nIn the Kreisligas and below, substituted players can be reused during a game. This is not possible in leagues above this level.<ref>''Spielordnung'', \u00a7 46 Auswechslung/R\u00fcckwechseln von Spielern</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''100 Jahre S\u00fcddeutscher Fussball-Verband - SFV'', {{in lang|de}} publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1996\n* ''50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband - BFV'', {{in lang|de}} publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1995\n* [http://www.bfv.de/cms/docs/Spielordnung_ab_11.09.2017.pdf ''Spielordnung''] {{in lang|de}} BFV website - Rules of the game (September 2017)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.dfb.de/start German FA website] {{in lang|de|en}}\n* [http://www.suedfv.de/ Southern German FA website] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.bfv.de/cms/index.html Bavarian FA website] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Football in Bavaria}}\n{{German state football associations}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Football in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Football governing bodies in Germany]]\n[[Category:1945 establishments in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Dutchy45", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLeagues:typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Football_Association"}

At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipinos]] and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesia]]n puppet government.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996</ref> \n\nTerauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement. When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref>\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\"<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref> (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that: <blockquote>\"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one.\"</blockquote> \n\nWhen told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi.

He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipino]]s and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesian]] puppet government.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996</ref> \n\nTerauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement. When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref>\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\"<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref> (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that: <blockquote>\"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one.\"</blockquote> \n\nWhen told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi.
