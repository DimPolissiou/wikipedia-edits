Their successes inspired President [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] and Dean Alice Dickinson to officially expand the program. In January 1975, the '''Ada Comstock Scholars Program''' was formally established under President [[Jill Ker Conway]] and in the fall of that year forty-five women were enrolled. The students range in ages, backgrounds, and geographical locations. The growth of the program peaked just over 400 students in 1988.\n\nThe program is named for [[Ada Comstock|Ada Louise Comstock Notestein]] (1876\u20131973), an 1897 Smith graduate, professor of English and dean of Smith from 1912\u201323, and president of [[Radcliffe College]] from 1923\u201343. Ada Comstock Notestein devoted much of her life to the academic excellence of women.

It is designed primarily, although not exclusively, for those who are teaching or who plan to teach some aspect of American culture and institutions.\n\nThe [[Smith College School for Social Work]] is nationally recognized for its specialization in clinical social work and puts a heavy emphasis on direct field work practice. The program is accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]]. The school offers a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree as well as a Ph.D. program designed to prepare MSWs for leadership positions in clinical research education and practice.\n\nThe college has a limited number of other programs leading to Ph.D.s, and is part of a cooperative doctoral program co-administered by [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Residential culture and student life===\nSmith requires most undergraduate students to live in on-campus houses unless they reside locally with their family. This policy is intended to add to the camaraderie and social cohesion of its students. Unlike most institutions of its type, Smith College does not have dorms, but rather 36 separate houses, ranging in architectural style from 18th-century to contemporary. It is rumored the architecture of Chapin House was the inspiration for the Tara Plantation House in ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.

Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House.\n\nHouses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location.\n\n=====Green Street Houses=====\n* Hubbard House \u2013 Hubbard House is the residence of fictional President [[Selina Meyer]] from the HBO Show [[Veep]].

One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]]. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.\n\n====Clubs, sports, and organizations====\nIn addition to the 11 varsity sports, there are currently more than 200 clubs and organizations that cater to Smith students\u2019 variety of interests.

If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own.\n\n=====Athletics=====\nSmith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|title=A Smith First: The New Game of Basketball|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807101716/https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|archive-date=2019-08-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|title=Flashback Photo: Smith College Basketball Team, 1904|date=2014-03-24|website=New England Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708054411/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|archive-date=2019-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams\u2014and to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today.\n\nSmith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.\n\nSmith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then \"follows\" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.\n\n=====Cultural organizations=====\nThere are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students\u2019 Association (ASA), Black Students\u2019 Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students\u2019 Organization (ISO), Korean Students\u2019 Association (KSA), the Latin American Students\u2019 Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students\u2019 Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students\u2019 Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students\u2019 Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created.\n\n===Academic year events===\n'''[[Convocation]]''' signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique \"senior hats,\" to be worn for the first time at Convocation.\n\n'''[[Mountain Day]]''' is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve [[New England]] road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together.\n\n'''[[Otelia Cromwell]] Day''', named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year.\n\n'''Rally Day''' In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of [[George Washington]]'s birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social\u2014though always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, \"Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?\" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as '''Rally Day''' (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae.\n\n===Reunions and Commencement events===\nThe Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; \"off-year\" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the \"Class of 1776.\"\n\nTraditional reunion and [[Graduation|Commencement]] events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.\n\n[[File:Smith College - Ivy Day Seniors.jpg|thumb|220px|Ivy Day]]\n\n'''[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]''', the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college.\n\n'''Illumination Night''', beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Gardens]]. The major official event of the night is the '''Senior Step Sing''': seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the '''Sophomore Push''' committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and \"into the real world.\"\n\nUntil the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. \"Significant\" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.\n\nThere have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See [[Smith College commencement controversies]] to learn more.\n\n==Environmental sustainability==\n[[File:Paradise Pond.jpg|thumb|Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left)]]\n\nSmith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts.<ref name=\"smith.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |title=Smith College: Green Smith |publisher=Smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930235407/http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |archive-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of \"to-go\" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer \"To-Go\" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, [[biodegradable plastic]], and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed.\n\nFor Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of \"A-\" on the \"College Sustainability Report Card 2010\" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |title=Smith College \u2013 Green Report Card 2010 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201946/http://greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |archive-date=2010-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumnae==\n<!--Please see Talk page discussion of notability criteria------------------------------------>\n<!--and the possibility of moving this section in its entirety to [[List of Smith College people]] or other page-->\n{{Main|List of Smith College people}}\n\nAmong the more notable of Smith College's alumnae in chronological order are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Otelia Cromwell]] (class of 1900): first African-American graduate of Smith college and the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from Yale\n* [[Eunice Carter]] (class of 1921): first female African-American assistant district attorney for the state of New York, active in the prosecution of mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano\n* [[Margaret Mitchell]] (class of 1922): author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Julia Child]] (class of 1934): chef, author and television personality <ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Madeleine L'Engle]] (class of 1941): author\n* [[Betty Friedan]] (class of 1942): feminist and author of ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''\n* [[Nancy Reagan]] (class of 1943): [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989\n* [[Penny Chenery]] (class of 1943): sportswoman, racehorse breeder and owner, horse racing advocate\n* [[Jean Harris]] (class of 1945): headmistress of the [[Madeira School]] who murdered her ex-lover [[Herman Tarnower]] in a jealous rage\n* [[Rhoda Dorsey]] (class of 1946): historian and first woman president of [[Goucher College]]\n* [[Barbara Bush]] (class of 1947): former [[First Lady of the United States]], did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Natalie Babbitt]] (class of 1954): notable illustrator and author of ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]''\n* [[Sylvia Plath]] (class of 1955): poet, novelist and short story author\n* [[Gloria Steinem]] (class of 1956): founder of ''[[Ms.]]'' magazine and noted feminist, activist, and journalist\n* [[Lynden B.

Their successes inspired President [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] and Dean Alice Dickinson to officially expand the program. In January 1975, the '''Ada Comstock Scholars Program''' was formally established under President [[Jill Ker Conway]] and in the fall of that year forty-five women were enrolled. The students range in ages, backgrounds, and geographical locations. The growth of the program peaked just over 400 students in 1988.\n\nThe program is named for [[Ada Comstock|Ada Louise Comstock Notestein]] (1876\u20131973), an 1897 Smith graduate, professor of English and dean of Smith from 1912\u201323, and president of [[Radcliffe College]] from 1923\u201343.

Unlike most institutions of its type, Smith College does not have dorms, but rather 36 separate houses, ranging in architectural style from 18th-century to contemporary.

Not satisfied with the change, students as well as various alumni formed the group Q&A (\"Queers and Allies\") to advocate for more trans-inclusive policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Drew|first=Sophie|date=|title=Challenging Gender at a Women\u2019s Institution:\nTransgender Admission and Inclusion at Smith College|url=|journal=Women Leading Change \u00a9 Newcomb College Institute|volume=3|pages=25-36|via=}}</ref> Q&A subsequently protested the policy on [[Facebook]] and other [[social media]] websites, as well as staging protests on campus that garnered significant media attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/students-at-smith-protest-the-colleges-refusal-to-admit-tran|title=Students At Smith Protest The College's Refusal To Admit Transgender Women|last=Yandoli|first=Krystie Lee|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In 2014, Smith formed an Admissions Policy Study Group, co-chaired by Daphne Lamothe and Audrey Smith, who at the time were associate professor of Afro-American studies and vice president for enrollment, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters/2014-15/admission-policy|title=President - Letters - Admission Policy Study Group|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group recommended that to be considered for admission to Smith, applicants live and/or identify as a woman, check the \"female\" box when applying, and that the President establish a working group to support all [[Transgender|trans]] and [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] students at Smith.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/studygroup/about.php|title=Smith College: Admission Policy Study Group|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> These recommendations went to the faculty<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/studygroup/about.php|title=Smith College: Admission Policy Study Group|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and the Board of Trustees<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/04/living/smith-college-transgender-women-feat/index.html|title=Smith College to admit transgender women|first=Brandon |last=Griggs|website=CNN|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and in 2015, Smith announced a [[Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges|new policy]] that only required female identification on the common application.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jaschik |first1=Scott |title=Tipping Point for Trans Admissions? |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/04/smith-college-will-accept-transgender-applicants-who-identify-women |website=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=5 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706213758/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/04/smith-college-will-accept-transgender-applicants-who-identify-women |archive-date=6 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Under the policy, [[transgender men]] and non-binary or [[genderqueer]] applicants are not eligible for admission.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/studygroup/faq.php|title=Smith College: Admission Policy Study Group FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=www.smith.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> This new policy also affirms that any student who, once admitted, transitions to another identity other than \"female\" and, who completes the college\u2019s graduation requirements, will be awarded a Smith degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/equity-inclusion/gender-identity-expression|title=Offices - Diversity - Gender Identity & Expression|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129052732/https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/equity-inclusion/gender-identity-expression|archive-date=2019-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref> The Resource Center for Sexuality and Gender; The Office for Equity and Inclusion and its Trans/Non-binary Working Group; Transcending Gender, a student group focused on support and education; and the Transgender Support Group run by Counseling Services work to support trans and non-binary students at Smith across the [[gender identity]] spectrum.  \n\nIn the fall of 2018, students at Smith protested after a Smith employee called the police on a black student working at Smith over the summer, when the employee saw her in a common space.

Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House.\n\nHouses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location.\n\n=====Green Street Houses=====\n* Hubbard House \u2013 Hubbard House is the residence of fictional President [[Selina Meyer]] from the HBO Show [[Veep]].

One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]]. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.\n\n====Clubs, sports, and organizations====\nIn addition to the 11 varsity sports, there are currently more than 200 clubs and organizations that cater to Smith students\u2019 variety of interests. There are options that can be found based on academic, political, cultural, and athletic interests. If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own.\n\n=====Athletics=====\nSmith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|title=A Smith First: The New Game of Basketball|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807101716/https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|archive-date=2019-08-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|title=Flashback Photo: Smith College Basketball Team, 1904|date=2014-03-24|website=New England Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708054411/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|archive-date=2019-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams\u2014and to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today.\n\nSmith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.\n\nSmith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then \"follows\" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.\n\n=====Cultural organizations=====\nThere are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students\u2019 Association (ASA), Black Students\u2019 Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students\u2019 Organization (ISO), Korean Students\u2019 Association (KSA), the Latin American Students\u2019 Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students\u2019 Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students\u2019 Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students\u2019 Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created.\n\n===Academic year events===\n'''[[Convocation]]''' signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique \"senior hats,\" to be worn for the first time at Convocation.\n\n'''[[Mountain Day]]''' is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve [[New England]] road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together.\n\n'''[[Otelia Cromwell]] Day''', named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year.\n\n'''Rally Day''' In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of [[George Washington]]'s birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social\u2014though always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, \"Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?\" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as '''Rally Day''' (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae.\n\n===Reunions and Commencement events===\nThe Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; \"off-year\" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the \"Class of 1776.\"\n\nTraditional reunion and [[Graduation|Commencement]] events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.\n\n[[File:Smith College - Ivy Day Seniors.jpg|thumb|220px|Ivy Day]]\n\n'''[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]''', the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college.\n\n'''Illumination Night''', beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Gardens]]. The major official event of the night is the '''Senior Step Sing''': seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the '''Sophomore Push''' committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and \"into the real world.\"\n\nUntil the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. \"Significant\" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.\n\nThere have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See [[Smith College commencement controversies]] to learn more.\n\n==Environmental sustainability==\n[[File:Paradise Pond.jpg|thumb|Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left)]]\n\nSmith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts.<ref name=\"smith.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |title=Smith College: Green Smith |publisher=Smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930235407/http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |archive-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of \"to-go\" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer \"To-Go\" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, [[biodegradable plastic]], and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed.\n\nFor Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of \"A-\" on the \"College Sustainability Report Card 2010\" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |title=Smith College \u2013 Green Report Card 2010 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201946/http://greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |archive-date=2010-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumnae==\n<!--Please see Talk page discussion of notability criteria------------------------------------>\n<!--and the possibility of moving this section in its entirety to [[List of Smith College people]] or other page-->\n{{Main|List of Smith College people}}\n\nAmong the more notable of Smith College's alumnae in chronological order are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Otelia Cromwell]] (class of 1900): first African-American graduate of Smith college and the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from Yale\n* [[Eunice Carter]] (class of 1921): first female African-American assistant district attorney for the state of New York, active in the prosecution of mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano\n* [[Margaret Mitchell]] (class of 1922): author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Julia Child]] (class of 1934): chef, author and television personality <ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Madeleine L'Engle]] (class of 1941): author\n* [[Betty Friedan]] (class of 1942): feminist and author of ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''\n* [[Nancy Reagan]] (class of 1943): [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989\n* [[Penny Chenery]] (class of 1943): sportswoman, racehorse breeder and owner, horse racing advocate\n* [[Jean Harris]] (class of 1945): headmistress of the [[Madeira School]] who murdered her ex-lover [[Herman Tarnower]] in a jealous rage\n* [[Rhoda Dorsey]] (class of 1946): historian and first woman president of [[Goucher College]]\n* [[Barbara Bush]] (class of 1947): former [[First Lady of the United States]], did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Natalie Babbitt]] (class of 1954): notable illustrator and author of ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]''\n* [[Sylvia Plath]] (class of 1955): poet, novelist and short story author\n* [[Gloria Steinem]] (class of 1956): founder of ''[[Ms.]]'' magazine and noted feminist, activist, and journalist\n* [[Lynden B.

Madero]] during the first phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In February 1913 Huerta led a conspiracy against Madero, who entrusted him to control a minor revolt in Mexico City. The [[Ten Tragic Days]] saw the forced resignation of Madero and his vice president and their murders. The coup was backed by Britain, France, and Germany as well the U.S. under the [[William Howard Taft|Taft Administration]] but the succeeding [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson administration]] refused to recognize the new regime and allowed arms sales to rebel forces.  Britain, France, and Germany did recognize the regime, but withdrew further support when revolutionary forces showed success against the regime and continued support threatened their relationship with the U.S. Huerta was forced to resign in July 1914 and flee the country with the aid of Germany, only 17 months into his presidency, after the federal army collapsed. While attempting to intrigue with German spies in the U.S. during [[World War I]] (1914-1918), Huerta was arrested in 1915 and died in U.S. custody.\n\nHis supporters were known as ''Huertistas'' during the Mexican Revolution. He is still vilified by modern-day Mexicans, who generally refer to him as ''El Chacal'' (\"The Jackal\") or ''El Usurpador'' (\"The Usurper\").<ref>McCartney, Laton.

Madero's brother, and [[Pancho Villa]], 1912.]]\nOn the eve of the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] against the long-established D\u00edaz regime, Huerta was teaching mathematics in Mexico City. He applied successfully to rejoin the army with his former rank and was accepted. He did not play a major role in the early stages of the Revolution that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz, although he commanded the military escort that gave D\u00edaz safe conduct into exile in May 1911. During the interim presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] following the resignation of D\u00edaz and the election of [[Francisco I. Madero]] in November 1911, General Huerta  carried out a campaign in Morelos, attempting to crush the rebellion led by [[Emilio Zapata]]. Huerta's forces burned villages supporting the rebellion and attacked their residents. These actions frustrated Madero's later attempts to placate those rebels.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Revolutionary Mexico'', p. 252.</ref> Huerta had a record of opposing revolutionaries and intrigues with Madero's enemies. Huerta's actions in Morelos forced a break between Emiliano Zapata and Madero, who was later to rebel against Madero immediately after his November 1911 election.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that revolutionary forces supporting [[Francisco I. Madero]] had forced D\u00edaz's resignation, Madero ordered them demobilized and retained the [[Federal Army|Mexican Federal Army]] they had just defeated.  Huerta pledged allegiance to President Madero, and carried out Madero's orders to crush anti-Madero revolts by rebel generals such as [[Pascual Orozco]], who had helped topple D\u00edaz and then rebelled against his regime.  In the Orozco rebellion, Huerta saw the opportunity to eliminate revolutionary general Pancho Villa, who was also attempting to suppress the revolt. Accused of stealing a horse, Villa then faced execution by Huerta without trial.  Only Madero's last minute intervention saved the life of one of his most effective generals.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> \n\nOrozco's rebellion was a major threat to the Madero government, since he had standing as a revolutionary and commanded significant forces. Madero sent Huerta to crush the rebellion. He had at his command troops of the Mexican Federal Army and these were joined by irregulars led by the revolutionary leader [[Pancho Villa]], at Torre\u00f3n in April 1912. Huerta offered Orozco's supporters (''Orozquistas'') amnesty, which might have weakened their forces already suffering from lack of money and arms.

The coup d'etat that toppled Madero February 1913, known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], was a conspiracy of Porfirio D\u00edaz's nephew, General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz, General Bernardo Reyes, and General Madrag\u00f3n.  The plotters attempted to draw in Huerta in January, but Huerta waited for a better incentive to join, since F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz expected to be the successor to Madero. The first day of the coup, February 9, General Reyes died in battle and General Lauro Villar, the commander of Madero's forces in Mexico City, was wounded.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/483 483]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

The conspirators then met at the US Embassy to sign ''El Pacto de la Embajada'' (The Embassy Pact), which provided for the exile of Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez and Huerta's takeover of the Mexican government.<ref name=revs>Richards, Michael D.

Lascur\u00e1in then appointed Huerta as [[Secretariat of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], making him next in line for the presidency. After less than an hour in office (some sources say as little as 15 minutes), Lascur\u00e1in resigned, handing the presidency to Huerta. At a late-night special session of Congress surrounded by Huerta's troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. Four days later Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez were taken from the National Palace to prison at night and shot by officers of the [[rurales]] (federal police), who were assumed to be acting on Huerta's orders. \n\nThe Huerta government was promptly recognized by all the western European governments, but the outgoing US administration of [[William Howard Taft]] refused to recognize the new government, as a way of pressuring Mexico to end the Chamizal border dispute in favor of the US, with the plan being to trade recognition for settling the dispute on American terms.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 68.</ref> Newly inaugurated U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had a general bias in favor of liberal democracy and had distaste for Gen. Huerta, who had come to power by coup and was implicated in the murder of Madero, but was initially open to recognizing Huerta provided that he could \"win\" an election that would give him a democratic veneer.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 69.</ref> F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz and the rest of the conservative leaders had seen Huerta as a transitional leader and pressed for early elections, which they expected to be won by Diaz on a Catholic conservative platform, and were rudely surprised when they discovered Huerta wanted to keep the presidency for himself.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 64.</ref> \n[[Image:Huerta y Orozco.jpg|right|thumb|Victoriano Huerta (left) and [[Pascual Orozco]] (right).]]\nHuerta moved quickly to consolidate power within Mexico with the support of state governors.<ref>Richmond, Douglas W. \"Victoriano Huerta\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 656.</ref> Huerta sought support from Pascual Orozco, whose rebellion against Madero Huerta had been in charge of suppressing. Orozco still held the leadership of significant forces in Chihuahua and potentially in Durango, so gaining his support was important to Huerta. Orozco had rebelled against Madero and Huerta had overthrown him, so there was the possibility of gaining his support. During a meeting of representatives of Huerta's government and Orozco's forces, Orozco laid out his terms for supporting Huerta. He sought recognition of his soldiers' service to the overthrown of Madero and pay; pensions and care of soldiers' widows and orphans, agrarian reforms, government payment of Orozquista debts that financed the campaign against Madero, and employment of Orozquistas as ''rurales''. Huerta agreed to the terms, and Orozco threw his support to Huerta on 27 February 1913.<ref>Meyer, ''Pascual Orozco'', pp. 97-98.</ref> Orozco sought to persuade Emiliano Zapata to make peace with Huerta regime. Zapata had held Orozco in high esteem as a fellow revolutionary who had rejected the Madero regime.  However, for Zapata, Orozco's support of Huerta was anathema,saying \"Huerta represents the defection of the army. You represent the defection of the Revolution.\"<ref>quoted in Meyer, ''Pascual Orozco'', p. 101.</ref>\n\nHuerta attempted to build further support for his government, and the urban working class in Mexico City made important gains before being suppressed. In particular, the leftist [[Casa del Obrero Mundial]] (House of the World Worker). The Casa organized demonstrations and strikes, which the Huerta regime initially tolerated. But then the government cracked down, arresting and deporting some leaders, and destroying the Casa's headquarters.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Revolutionary Mexico: The Coming Process of the Mexican Revolution''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1987, pp. 271-72.</ref> Huerta also sought to diffuse agrarian agitation, which fueled the rebellion in Morelos led by Emiliano Zapata. The most vocal intellectual in favor of land reform was [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]], whose 1909 publication ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) focused on inequality of land tenure. Molina Enr\u00edquez joined the Huerta government heading the Department of Labor.  He had denounced the overthrow of Madero, but \"initially saw in the Huerta regime the political formula he believed Mexico required: a strong military leader capable of imposing the social reforms Mexico needed to benefit the masses.\" However, despite internal support in the Huerta regime for reform, Huerta increasingly embraced militarization and Molina Enr\u00edquez resigned.<ref>Shadle, Stanley F. ''Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez: Mexican Land Reformer of the Revolutionary Era''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1994, pp. 62-63.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Desconocimiento de Victoriano Huerta como Jefe del Poder Ejecutivo de la Rep\u00fablica.tif|thumb|right|Venustiano Carranza disavows Victoriano Huerta's claim to the presidency]]\n\nChihuahua Gov. [[Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez (governor)|Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez]] refused and Huerta had him arrested and murdered in March 1913.\nThe most important challenge from a state governor was by [[Venustiano Carranza]], governor of Coahuila, who drafted the [[Plan of Guadalupe]], calling for the creation of a [[Constitutionalist Army]] (evoking the 1857 Liberal Constitution) to oust the usurper Huerta and restore constitutional government. Supporters of Carranza's plan included [[Emiliano Zapata]], who nonetheless remained loyal to his own [[Plan de Ayala]]; northern revolutionary [[Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa]]; and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. However, former revolutionary Gen. [[Pascual Orozco]], whom Huerta fought when serving President Madero, now joined with Huerta as a counter-revolutionary. Four Deputies were executed over the summer of 1913 for criticizing the Huerta regime.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 67.</ref> One deputy was arrested by Mexico City police as he was delivering a speech denouncing Huerta at a rally and taken out to the countryside, where he was \"shot while trying to escape\".<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.67.</ref> Lacking popular legitimacy, Huerta chose to turn the refusal of the US to recognize his government as an example of American \"interference\" in Mexico's internal affairs, organizing anti-American demonstrations in the summer of 1913 with the hope of gaining some popular support.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 71.</ref>    \n\nBritish historian [[Alan Knight (historian)|Alan Knight]] wrote about Huerta: \"The consistent thread which ran through the Huerta regime, from start to finish, was militarisation: the growth and reliance on the Federal Army, the military takeover of public offices, the preference for military over political solutions, the militarisation of society in general\".<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1990 page 62.</ref> Huerta \"came very close to converting Mexico into the most completely militaristic state in the world.\"<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p. 62.</ref> Huerta's stated goal was a return to the \"order\" of the [[Porfiriato]], but his methods were unlike those of Diaz, who had shown a talent for compromise and diplomacy; seeking support from and playing off regional elites, using not only army officers but also technocrats, former guerrilla leaders, ''[[cacique]]s'' and provincial elites to support his regime.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 63.</ref> By contrast, Huerta relied entirely upon the army for support, giving officers all of the key jobs, regardless of their talents, as Huerta sought to rule with ''La Mano Dura'' (\"The Iron Hand\"), believing only in military solutions to all problems.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p. 63.</ref> For this reason, Huerta during his short time as President was the object of far more hatred than Diaz ever was; even the Zapatistas had a certain respect for Diaz as a patriarchal leader who had enough sense to finally leave with dignity in 1911, whereas Huerta was seen as a thuggish soldier who had Madero murdered and sought to terrorize the nation into submission.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 63.</ref> Huerta disliked cabinet meetings, ordered his ministers about as if they were non-commissioned officers and displayed in general a highly autocratic style.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 64.</ref> \n\nHuerta established a harsh military dictatorship.<ref>Richmond, \"Victoriano Huerta\", p. 657.</ref> [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Woodrow Wilson became hostile to the Huerta administration, recalled ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]] and demanded Huerta step aside for democratic elections. In August 1913 Wilson imposed an arms embargo on Mexico, forcing Huerta to turn to Europe and Japan to buy arms.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 72.</ref> Reflecting the general disenchantment with Huerta's \"iron hand\" policies, a prominent conservative, Sen. [[Belisario Dom\u00ednguez]] of Chiapas, handed out copies of a speech he did not dare to deliver in the Senate, accusing Huerta of starting the civil war which he was losing, of wanting \"to cover the land with corpses . . . rather than abandon power\" and called for Congress to impeach Huerta before Mexico was plunged into the abyss.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'' 66.</ref> Dom\u00ednguez knew he was risking his life by speaking out and sent his wife and children out of Mexico before handing out copies of his speech.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.66.</ref> Dom\u00ednguez was arrested by two policemen plus Huerta's son and son-in-law, taken to a cemetery where he was \"shot while trying to escape\" for speaking out against the President. His body was dumped into the grave that his killers had already dug for him.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'', page 67.</ref> On 10 October 1913, when Congress announced it was opening an investigation of the disappearance of Sen. Dom\u00ednguez, who had last been seen several days before being forced into a police car, Huerta sent his soldiers in to shut down Congress in session and arrested 110 Senators and Deputies, of whom 74 were charged with high treason and put to work building a bullfighting arena.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.75.</ref> \n\nThe federal army Huerta took over in February 1913 numbered between 45,000-50,000 men. Huerta continued to increase the strength of the army, issuing a degree for conscripting 150,000 men in October 1913; another degree for conscripting 200,000 men in January 1914 and one for a quarter of million men in March 1914. These figures were never achieved as many men fled to fight for the Constitutionalists rather than Huerta.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 77.</ref> Together with an increase in the number of the paramilitary ''[[rurales]]'' mounted police force and the state militias, Huerta had approximately 300,000 men, or about 4% of the population, fighting for him by early 1914.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p.77.</ref> Faced with widespread reluctance to serve Huerta had to resort to the ''leva'', as vagrants, criminals, captured rebels, political prisoners and sometimes just men on the streets were rounded up to serve in the Federal Army.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 77.</ref> In Veracruz workers getting off the night shift at factories were rounded up in a ''leva'' (forced conscription), while in Mexico City poor men going to hospitals were rounded up in the ''leva''.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.77.</ref> As Indians were felt to be particularly docile and submissive to whites, the ''leva'' was applied especially heavily in the southern Mexico, where the majority of the people were Indians. Thousands of Juchiteco and Maya Indians were rounded up to fight a war in the north of Mexico that they felt did not concern them.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' page 78.</ref> A visitor to M\u00e9rida in the Yucat\u00e1n wrote of \"heart-breaking\" scenes as hundreds of Maya Indians said goodbye to their wives as they were forced to board a train while in chains.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 78.</ref> \n\nAs the men rounded up in the ''leva'' proved to be poor soldiers, prone to desertion and mutiny, Huerta had to follow a defensive strategy of keeping the army concentrated in large towns, since his soldiers in the field would either desert or go over to the rebels.<ref>Knight,  ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 79.</ref> Throughout the civil war of 1913-14 the Constitutionalists fought with a ferocity and courage that the federal army never managed.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 79.</ref> In Yucat\u00e1n about 70% of the army were men conscripted from the prisons, while one \"volunteer\" battalion consisted of captured Yaqui Indians.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 79.</ref> In October 1913, in the town of Tlalnepantla, the army's 9th Regiment, which was said to have been \"crazed with alcohol and marijuana\", mutinied, murdered their officers and went over to the rebels.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'',  p. 79.</ref> To provide volunteers, Huerta turned to Mexican nationalism and anti-Americanism in the fall of 1913, running spurious stories in the press warning of an imminent American invasion and asking for patriotic men to step up to defend Mexico.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', pp. 79-80.</ref> The campaign attracted some volunteers from the lower middle class, through they were usually disillusioned when they learned that they were going to fight other Mexicans, not the Americans.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.80.</ref> In rural Mexico a sense of Mexican nationalism barely existed at this time among the ''campesinos''. Mexico was an abstract entity that meant nothing, and most ''campesinos'' were primarily loyal to their own villages, the ''patria chicas''.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 80.</ref> Huerta's patriotic campaign was a complete failure in the countryside.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.80.</ref> The other source of volunteers was to allow wealthy landlords to raise private armies under the guise of the state militias, but few ''peons'' wanted to fight, let alone die, for Gen. Huerta, since the Constitutionalists were promising land reform.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', pp. 81-82.</ref>\n\nWhen Huerta refused to call elections, and with the situation further exacerbated by the [[Tampico Affair]], President Wilson landed US troops to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy]] Mexico's most important seaport, [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]].\n\nAfter the federal army was repeatedly defeated in battle by Constitutionalist generals [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] and Pancho Villa, climaxing in the [[Battle of Zacatecas (1914)|Battle of Zacatecas]], Huerta bowed to internal and external pressure and resigned the presidency on 15 July 1914.<ref>[https://www.biografiacortade.com/victoriano-huerta-marquez/ \"Huerta's ] [https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n96/mode/1up Final Message to the Mexican Congress\"].

However, a US Army colonel with 25 soldiers and two deputy US marshals intervened and arrested him as he left the train, on a charge of sedition.<ref>Blum, Howard. ''Dark Invasion: 1915 - Germany's Secret War'', Harper, 2014, p. 228.</ref> The German-initiated plan for Huerta to regain the Mexican presidency through a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was foiled. After some time in a US Army prison at [[Fort Bliss]] he was released on bail, but remained under house arrest due to risk of flight to Mexico. A day after, he attended a dinner at Fort Bliss. Later he was returned to jail, and while so confined died, perhaps of [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].

New  York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996</ref>  Diverse factions and interests in Mexico came together against the Huerta regime, including the Zapatistas in Morelos and the Constitutionalists in northern Mexico under Venustiano Carranza.  Once Huerta was ousted, the loose coalition fell apart and Mexico was plunged into a civil war between the winners. Germany and Great Britain's backing of Huerta weakened their influence in Mexico while the hostility of the United States to the regime increased it. Although U.S. business interests had hoped that President Wilson would recognize the Huerta government, they realized he would not and began aligning themselves with different revolutionary factions.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 566.</ref> One historian argues that Huerta's regime was not as conservative or reactionary as portrayed, arguing that he did not attempt to \"reincarnate\" the Age of D\u00edaz. \"Huerta and his advisors both realized the days of D\u00edaz were gone forever. They did not attempt to stem the new energies and forces unleashed in 1910; rather they attempted to moderate them.\"<ref>Meyer, Michael C. ''Huerta: A Political Portrait''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1972, pp. 369-70</ref> In general, however, his regime is seen as a repudiation of democracy and Huerta himself an iron-fisted authoritarian. Despite efforts in Mexico to redress the exclusion of Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez from the pantheon of Mexican revolutionaries, since he is considered the intellectual father of the Article 27 of the 1917 Mexican Constitution empowering the state to implement [[land reform in Mexico|land reform]] and expropriate private owners of resources like oil.

Madero]] during the first phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In February 1913 Huerta led a conspiracy against Madero, who entrusted him to control a minor revolt in Mexico City. The [[Ten Tragic Days]] saw the forced resignation of Madero and his vice president and their murders. The coup was backed Britain, France, and Germany as well the U.S. under the [[William Howard Taft|Taft Administration]] but the succeeding [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson administration]] refused to recognize the new regime and allowed arms sales to rebel forces.  Britain, France, and Germany did recognize the regime, but withdrew further support when revolutionary forces showed success against the regime and continued support threatened their relationship with the U.S. Huerta was forced to resign in July 1914 and flee the country with the aid of Germany, only 17 months into his presidency, after the federal army collapsed. While attempting to intrigue with German spies in the U.S. during [[World War I]] (1914-1918), Huerta was arrested in 1915 and died in U.S. custody.\n\nHis supporters were known as ''Huertistas'' during the Mexican Revolution. He is still vilified by modern-day Mexicans, who generally refer to him as ''El Chacal'' (\"The Jackal\") or ''El Usurpador'' (\"The Usurper\").<ref>McCartney, Laton.

Madero's brother, and [[Pancho Villa]], 1912.]]\nOn the eve of the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] against the long-established D\u00edaz regime, Huerta was teaching mathematics in Mexico City. He applied successfully to rejoin the army with his former rank and was accepted. He did not play a major role in the early stages of the Revolution that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz, although he commanded the military escort that gave D\u00edaz safe conduct into exile in May 1911. During the interim presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] following the resignation of D\u00edaz and the election of [[Francisco I. Madero]] in November 1911, General Huerta  carried out a campaign in Morelos, attempting to crush the rebellion led by [[Emilio Zapata]]. Huerta's forces burned villages supporting the rebellion and attacked their residents. These actions frustrated Madero's later attempts to placate those rebels.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Revolutionary Mexico'', p. 252.</ref> Huerta had a record of opposing revolutionaries and intrigues with Madero's enemies. Huerta's actions in Morelos forced a break between Emiliano Zapata and Madero, who was later to rebel against Madero immediately after his November 1911 election.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that revolutionary forces supporting [[Francisco I. Madero]] had forced D\u00edaz's resignation, Madero ordered them demobilized and retained the [[Federal Army|Mexican Federal Army]] they had just defeated.  Huerta pledged allegiance to President Madero, and carried out Madero's orders to crush anti-Madero revolts by rebel generals such as [[Pascual Orozco]], who had helped topple D\u00edaz and then rebelled against his regime.  In the Orozco rebellion, Huerta saw the opportunity to eliminate revolutionary general Pancho Villa, who was also attempting to suppress the revolt. Accused of stealing a horse, Villa then faced execution by Huerta without trial.  Only Madero's last minute intervention saved the life of one of his most effective generals.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> \n\nOrozco's rebellion was a major threat to the Madero government, since he had standing as a revolutionary and commanded significant forces. Madero sent Huerta to crush the rebellion. He had at his command troops of the Mexican Federal Army and these were joined by irregulars led by the revolutionary leader [[Pancho Villa]], at Torre\u00f3n in April 1912. Huerta offered Orozco's supporters (''Orozquistas'') amnesty, which might have weakened their forces already suffering from lack of money and arms. Huerta's forces defeated Orozco's at Rellano in May 1912. With that victory Huerta \"had suddenly become a military hero with a national reputation.\"<ref>Meyer, Michael C.

Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1967, p. 82.</ref> \n\n==Huerta and Madero's overthrow==\n{{Main|Ten Tragic Days}}\nAs Madero lost support and as internal and external groups plotted to remove him from the presidency, Huerta secretly joined the conspiracy.  The coup d'etat that toppled Madero February 1913, known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], was a conspiracy of Porfirio D\u00edaz's nephew, General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz, General Bernardo Reyes, and General Madrag\u00f3n.  The plotters attempted to draw in Huerta in January, but Huerta waited for a better incentive to join, since F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz expected to be the successor to Madero. The first day of the coup, February 9, General Reyes died in battle and General Lauro Villar, the commander of Madero's forces in Mexico City, was wounded.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/483 483]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

According to historian [[Friedrich Katz]], \"It was a decision for which [Madero] would pay with his life.\"<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> Having secured that key position, Huerta reopened negotiations with the plotters and joined them in secret.

Ambassador Wilson believed that Huerta would not have staged a coup had the United States not assured them that it would recognize the new regime.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 98.</ref>   Following a confused few days of fighting in Mexico City between loyalist and rebel factions of the army, Huerta had Madero and vice-president [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] seized and briefly imprisoned on 18 February 1913 in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]]. The conspirators then met at the US Embassy to sign ''El Pacto de la Embajada'' (The Embassy Pact), which provided for the exile of Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez and Huerta's takeover of the Mexican government.<ref name=revs>Richards, Michael D. ''Revolutions in world history'', Routledge, 2004, [https://archive.org/details/revolutionsinwor0000rich/page/26 p. 26].</ref>\n\n==''La Mano Dura'': Presidency of Mexico==\n[[Image:Victoriano Huerta y su gabinete.tif|thumb|right|Victoriano Huerta and his cabinet]]\nTo give the coup the appearance of legitimacy, Huerta had [[foreign minister]] [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] assume the presidency; under the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]], the foreign minister stood third in line for the presidency behind the Vice President and [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General]]; Madero's attorney general had also been ousted in the coup. Lascur\u00e1in then appointed Huerta as [[Secretariat of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], making him next in line for the presidency. After less than an hour in office (some sources say as little as 15 minutes), Lascur\u00e1in resigned, handing the presidency to Huerta. At a late-night special session of Congress surrounded by Huerta's troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. Four days later Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez were taken from the National Palace to prison at night and shot by officers of the [[rurales]] (federal police), who were assumed to be acting on Huerta's orders. \n\nThe Huerta government was promptly recognized by all the western European governments, but the outgoing US administration of [[William Howard Taft]] refused to recognize the new government, as a way of pressuring Mexico to end the Chamizal border dispute in favor of the US, with the plan being to trade recognition for settling the dispute on American terms.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 68.</ref> Newly inaugurated U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had a general bias in favor of liberal democracy and had distaste for Gen. Huerta, who had come to power by coup and was implicated in the murder of Madero, but was initially open to recognizing Huerta provided that he could \"win\" an election that would give him a democratic veneer.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 69.</ref> F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz and the rest of the conservative leaders had seen Huerta as a transitional leader and pressed for early elections, which they expected to be won by Diaz on a Catholic conservative platform, and were rudely surprised when they discovered Huerta wanted to keep the presidency for himself.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 64.</ref> \n[[Image:Huerta y Orozco.jpg|right|thumb|Victoriano Huerta (left) and [[Pascual Orozco]] (right).]]\nHuerta moved quickly to consolidate power within Mexico with the support of state governors.<ref>Richmond, Douglas W. \"Victoriano Huerta\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 656.</ref> Huerta sought support from Pascual Orozco, whose rebellion against Madero Huerta had been in charge of suppressing. Orozco still held the leadership of significant forces in Chihuahua and potentially in Durango, so gaining his support was important to Huerta. Orozco had rebelled against Madero and Huerta had overthrown him, so there was the possibility of gaining his support. During a meeting of representatives of Huerta's government and Orozco's forces, Orozco laid out his terms for supporting Huerta. He sought recognition of his soldiers' service to the overthrown of Madero and pay; pensions and care of soldiers' widows and orphans, agrarian reforms, government payment of Orozquista debts that financed the campaign against Madero, and employment of Orozquistas as ''rurales''. Huerta agreed to the terms, and Orozco threw his support to Huerta on 27 February 1913.<ref>Meyer, ''Pascual Orozco'', pp. 97-98.</ref> Orozco sought to persuade Emiliano Zapata to make peace with Huerta regime. Zapata had held Orozco in high esteem as a fellow revolutionary who had rejected the Madero regime.  However, for Zapata, Orozco's support of Huerta was anathema,saying \"Huerta represents the defection of the army. You represent the defection of the Revolution.\"<ref>quoted in Meyer, ''Pascual Orozco'', p. 101.</ref>\n\nHuerta attempted to build further support for his government, and the urban working class in Mexico City made important gains before being suppressed. In particular, the leftist [[Casa del Obrero Mundial]] (House of the World Worker). The Casa organized demonstrations and strikes, which the Huerta regime initially tolerated. But then the government cracked down, arresting and deporting some leaders, and destroying the Casa's headquarters.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Revolutionary Mexico: The Coming Process of the Mexican Revolution''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1987, pp. 271-72.</ref> Huerta also sought to diffuse agrarian agitation, which fueled the rebellion in Morelos led by Emiliano Zapata. The most vocal intellectual in favor of land reform was [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]], whose 1909 publication ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) focused on inequality of land tenure. Molina Enr\u00edquez joined the Huerta government heading the Department of Labor.  He had denounced the overthrow of Madero, but \"initially saw in the Huerta regime the political formula he believed Mexico required: a strong military leader capable of imposing the social reforms Mexico needed to benefit the masses.\" However, despite internal support in the Huerta regime for reform, Huerta increasingly embraced militarization and Molina Enr\u00edquez resigned.<ref>Shadle, Stanley F. ''Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez: Mexican Land Reformer of the Revolutionary Era''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1994, pp. 62-63.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Desconocimiento de Victoriano Huerta como Jefe del Poder Ejecutivo de la Rep\u00fablica.tif|thumb|right|Venustiano Carranza disavows Victoriano Huerta's claim to the presidency]]\n\nChihuahua Gov. [[Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez (governor)|Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez]] refused and Huerta had him arrested and murdered in March 1913.\nThe most important challenge from a state governor was by [[Venustiano Carranza]], governor of Coahuila, who drafted the [[Plan of Guadalupe]], calling for the creation of a [[Constitutionalist Army]] (evoking the 1857 Liberal Constitution) to oust the usurper Huerta and restore constitutional government. Supporters of Carranza's plan included [[Emiliano Zapata]], who nonetheless remained loyal to his own [[Plan de Ayala]]; northern revolutionary [[Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa]]; and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. However, former revolutionary Gen. [[Pascual Orozco]], whom Huerta fought when serving President Madero, now joined with Huerta as a counter-revolutionary. Four Deputies were executed over the summer of 1913 for criticizing the Huerta regime.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 67.</ref> One deputy was arrested by Mexico City police as he was delivering a speech denouncing Huerta at a rally and taken out to the countryside, where he was \"shot while trying to escape\".<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.67.</ref> Lacking popular legitimacy, Huerta chose to turn the refusal of the US to recognize his government as an example of American \"interference\" in Mexico's internal affairs, organizing anti-American demonstrations in the summer of 1913 with the hope of gaining some popular support.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 71.</ref>    \n\nBritish historian [[Alan Knight (historian)|Alan Knight]] wrote about Huerta: \"The consistent thread which ran through the Huerta regime, from start to finish, was militarisation: the growth and reliance on the Federal Army, the military takeover of public offices, the preference for military over political solutions, the militarisation of society in general\".<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1990 page 62.</ref> Huerta \"came very close to converting Mexico into the most completely militaristic state in the world.\"<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p. 62.</ref> Huerta's stated goal was a return to the \"order\" of the [[Porfiriato]], but his methods were unlike those of Diaz, who had shown a talent for compromise and diplomacy; seeking support from and playing off regional elites, using not only army officers but also technocrats, former guerrilla leaders, ''[[cacique]]s'' and provincial elites to support his regime.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 63.</ref> By contrast, Huerta relied entirely upon the army for support, giving officers all of the key jobs, regardless of their talents, as Huerta sought to rule with ''La Mano Dura'' (\"The Iron Hand\"), believing only in military solutions to all problems.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p. 63.</ref> For this reason, Huerta during his short time as President was the object of far more hatred than Diaz ever was; even the Zapatistas had a certain respect for Diaz as a patriarchal leader who had enough sense to finally leave with dignity in 1911, whereas Huerta was seen as a thuggish soldier who had Madero murdered and sought to terrorize the nation into submission.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 63.</ref> Huerta disliked cabinet meetings, ordered his ministers about as if they were non-commissioned officers and displayed in general a highly autocratic style.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 64.</ref> \n\nHuerta established a harsh military dictatorship.<ref>Richmond, \"Victoriano Huerta\", p. 657.</ref> [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Woodrow Wilson became hostile to the Huerta administration, recalled ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]] and demanded Huerta step aside for democratic elections. In August 1913 Wilson imposed an arms embargo on Mexico, forcing Huerta to turn to Europe and Japan to buy arms.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 72.</ref> Reflecting the general disenchantment with Huerta's \"iron hand\" policies, a prominent conservative, Sen. [[Belisario Dom\u00ednguez]] of Chiapas, handed out copies of a speech he did not dare to deliver in the Senate, accusing Huerta of starting the civil war which he was losing, of wanting \"to cover the land with corpses . . . rather than abandon power\" and called for Congress to impeach Huerta before Mexico was plunged into the abyss.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'' 66.</ref> Dom\u00ednguez knew he was risking his life by speaking out and sent his wife and children out of Mexico before handing out copies of his speech.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.66.</ref> Dom\u00ednguez was arrested by two policemen plus Huerta's son and son-in-law, taken to a cemetery where he was \"shot while trying to escape\" for speaking out against the President. His body was dumped into the grave that his killers had already dug for him.<ref>Knight, Alan ''The Mexican Revolution'', page 67.</ref> On 10 October 1913, when Congress announced it was opening an investigation of the disappearance of Sen. Dom\u00ednguez, who had last been seen several days before being forced into a police car, Huerta sent his soldiers in to shut down Congress in session and arrested 110 Senators and Deputies, of whom 74 were charged with high treason and put to work building a bullfighting arena.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.75.</ref> \n\nThe federal army Huerta took over in February 1913 numbered between 45,000-50,000 men. Huerta continued to increase the strength of the army, issuing a degree for conscripting 150,000 men in October 1913; another degree for conscripting 200,000 men in January 1914 and one for a quarter of million men in March 1914. These figures were never achieved as many men fled to fight for the Constitutionalists rather than Huerta.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 77.</ref> Together with an increase in the number of the paramilitary ''[[rurales]]'' mounted police force and the state militias, Huerta had approximately 300,000 men, or about 4% of the population, fighting for him by early 1914.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution: Counter-Revolution and Reconstruction'', p.77.</ref> Faced with widespread reluctance to serve Huerta had to resort to the ''leva'', as vagrants, criminals, captured rebels, political prisoners and sometimes just men on the streets were rounded up to serve in the Federal Army.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 77.</ref> In Veracruz workers getting off the night shift at factories were rounded up in a ''leva'' (forced conscription), while in Mexico City poor men going to hospitals were rounded up in the ''leva''.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.77.</ref> As Indians were felt to be particularly docile and submissive to whites, the ''leva'' was applied especially heavily in the southern Mexico, where the majority of the people were Indians. Thousands of Juchiteco and Maya Indians were rounded up to fight a war in the north of Mexico that they felt did not concern them.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'' page 78.</ref> A visitor to M\u00e9rida in the Yucat\u00e1n wrote of \"heart-breaking\" scenes as hundreds of Maya Indians said goodbye to their wives as they were forced to board a train while in chains.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 78.</ref> \n\nAs the men rounded up in the ''leva'' proved to be poor soldiers, prone to desertion and mutiny, Huerta had to follow a defensive strategy of keeping the army concentrated in large towns, since his soldiers in the field would either desert or go over to the rebels.<ref>Knight,  ''The Mexican Revolution'' p. 79.</ref> Throughout the civil war of 1913-14 the Constitutionalists fought with a ferocity and courage that the federal army never managed.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 79.</ref> In Yucat\u00e1n about 70% of the army were men conscripted from the prisons, while one \"volunteer\" battalion consisted of captured Yaqui Indians.<ref>Knight,''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 79.</ref> In October 1913, in the town of Tlalnepantla, the army's 9th Regiment, which was said to have been \"crazed with alcohol and marijuana\", mutinied, murdered their officers and went over to the rebels.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'',  p. 79.</ref> To provide volunteers, Huerta turned to Mexican nationalism and anti-Americanism in the fall of 1913, running spurious stories in the press warning of an imminent American invasion and asking for patriotic men to step up to defend Mexico.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', pp. 79-80.</ref> The campaign attracted some volunteers from the lower middle class, through they were usually disillusioned when they learned that they were going to fight other Mexicans, not the Americans.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.80.</ref> In rural Mexico a sense of Mexican nationalism barely existed at this time among the ''campesinos''. Mexico was an abstract entity that meant nothing, and most ''campesinos'' were primarily loyal to their own villages, the ''patria chicas''.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p. 80.</ref> Huerta's patriotic campaign was a complete failure in the countryside.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', p.80.</ref> The other source of volunteers was to allow wealthy landlords to raise private armies under the guise of the state militias, but few ''peons'' wanted to fight, let alone die, for Gen. Huerta, since the Constitutionalists were promising land reform.<ref>Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution'', pp. 81-82.</ref>\n\nWhen Huerta refused to call elections, and with the situation further exacerbated by the [[Tampico Affair]], President Wilson landed US troops to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy]] Mexico's most important seaport, [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]].\n\nAfter the federal army was repeatedly defeated in battle by Constitutionalist generals [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] and Pancho Villa, climaxing in the [[Battle of Zacatecas (1914)|Battle of Zacatecas]], Huerta bowed to internal and external pressure and resigned the presidency on 15 July 1914.<ref>[https://www.biografiacortade.com/victoriano-huerta-marquez/ \"Huerta's ] [https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n96/mode/1up Final Message to the Mexican Congress\"].

[[Franz von Rintelen]] of German Navy Intelligence for money to purchase weapons and arrange [[U-boat]] landings to provide support, while offering (perhaps as a bargaining chip) to make war on the US, which Germany hoped would end munitions supplies to the Allies.<ref>Tuchman, Barbara W. ''The Zimmermann Telegram'' (New York: NEL Mentor, 1967), pp. 73-4.</ref> Their meetings, held at the [[Hotel Manhattan|Manhattan Hotel]] (as well as another New York hotel, \"probably the Holland House\" at Fifth Avenue and 30th Street)<ref name=\"Tuchman, p.73\">Tuchman, p. 73.</ref>, were observed by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]men, and von Rintelen's telephone conversations were routinely intercepted and recorded.<ref name=\"Tuchman, p.73\"/>\n\nHuerta traveled from New York by train to [[Newman, New Mexico|Newman]], [[New Mexico]] (25 miles from the border), where he was to be met by Gen. [[Pascual Orozco]] and some well-armed Mexican supporters. However, a US Army colonel with 25 soldiers and two deputy US marshals intervened and arrested him as he left the train, on a charge of sedition.<ref>Blum, Howard. ''Dark Invasion: 1915 - Germany's Secret War'', Harper, 2014, p. 228.</ref> The German-initiated plan for Huerta to regain the Mexican presidency through a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was foiled. After some time in a US Army prison at [[Fort Bliss]] he was released on bail, but remained under house arrest due to risk of flight to Mexico. A day after, he attended a dinner at Fort Bliss. Later he was returned to jail, and while so confined died, perhaps of [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]]. While the main symptom was [[jaundice|yellow jaundice]], poisoning by the US was widely suspected.<ref name=Lee>Stacy, Lee.

New  York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996</ref>  Diverse factions and interests in Mexico came together against the Huerta regime, including the Zapatistas in Morelos and the Constitutionalists in northern Mexico under Venustiano Carranza.  Once Huerta was ousted, the loose coalition fell apart and Mexico was plunged into a civil war between the winners. Germany and Great Britain's backing of Huerta weakened their influence in Mexico while the hostility of the United States to the regime increased it. Although U.S. business interests had hoped that President Wilson would recognize the Huerta government, they realized he would not and began aligning themselves with different revolutionary factions.<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 566.</ref> One historian argues that Huerta's regime was not as conservative or reactionary as portrayed, arguing that he did not attempt to \"reincarnate\" the Age of D\u00edaz. \"Huerta and his advisors both realized the days of D\u00edaz were gone forever. They did not attempt to stem the new energies and forces unleashed in 1910; rather they attempted to moderate them.\"<ref>Meyer, Michael C. ''Huerta: A Political Portrait''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1972, pp. 369-70</ref> In general, however, his regime is seen as a repudiation of democracy and Huerta himself an iron-fisted authoritarian. Despite efforts in Mexico to redress the exclusion of Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez from the pantheon of Mexican revolutionaries, since he is considered the intellectual father of the Article 27 of the 1917 Mexican Constitution empowering the state to implement [[land reform in Mexico|land reform]] and expropriate private owners of resources like oil. Molina Enr\u00edquez was tainted by his service in the Huerta government.<ref>Shadle, ''Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez'', p.4.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nHuerta has been portrayed or referenced in any number of movies dealing with the Mexican Revolution, including ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' and ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]''.\n\nIn the 1952 film ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'', starring [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Emiliano Zapata]], Huerta is portrayed by [[Frank Silvera]].\n\nIn the 1968 film ''[[Villa Rides]]'', Huerta was played by [[Herbert Lom]].\n\nIn the novel ''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' (1996), by [[James Carlos Blake]], Huerta is a major character.\n\nBoth Victoriano Huerta and Pancho Villa are referenced in the fourth \"Indiana Jones movie\", ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' (2008), when Indiana ([[Harrison Ford]]) is recalling events in his childhood to his yet-to-be revealed son ([[Shia LaBeouf]]): \"It was a fight against Victoriano Huerta\".

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, while Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic heating. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the \"Violet Banner\" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, while Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic heating. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the \"Violet Banner\" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]].

The district was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974 from the former area of [[Basildon Urban District]] and the part of [[Thurrock Urban District]] that was within the Basildon New Town. The population of the district as of 2010 is about 172,000. The council made an application for [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in February 2010 and this was given approval that year, with Cllr Mo Larkin becoming the first mayor in October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062153/http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2011 |title=Basildon to get its first Mayor |publisher=Basildon District Council |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-11315875 | title=Basildon district becomes borough | publisher=BBC News | date=15 September 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011 }}</ref> The local authority is [[Basildon Borough Council]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{see also|Basildon local elections}}\nElections to [[Basildon Borough Council]] are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 42 seats on the council being elected at each election.

The river runs across the district, through [[Wickford]] before it leaves the district.\n\nThe district is linked well by road and rail with significant surrounding destinations, including [[London]].\n\nIn the west of the Basildon district, the [[Dunton Plotlands]] is an area of small plots of land used as weekend cottages or smallholdings inhabited during the mid twentieth century.\n\n=== List of settlements ===\nIt contains the towns of:\n\n* [[Basildon]] (the administrative headquarters)\n** [[Laindon]]\n** [[Langdon Hills]]\n** [[Pitsea]]\n** [[Vange]]\n* [[Billericay]]\n* [[Wickford]]\n\nVillages within the district are:\n* [[Bowers Gifford]]\n* [[Crays Hill]]\n* [[Dunton Wayletts]]\n* [[Great Burstead]]\n* [[Little Burstead]]\n* [[Nevendon]]\n* [[North Benfleet]]\n* [[Ramsden Bellhouse]]\n* [[Shotgate]]\n* [[Great Berry]]\n\n==Regeneration plans==\nBasildon District is a prosperous business location and has in recent years seen significant inward investment and jobs growth. Throughout Basildon District there are major developments planned estimated to total nearly \u00a32 billion. These include:\n\n*The regeneration of Basildon, Wickford, Pitsea, and Laindon Town Centres\n*A new Sporting Village and improvements to playing pitches and sports facilities throughout the District to make Basildon the Centre for Sport in South Essex. The sporting village is expected in 2010, and is being highly sought after as an Olympic training base for one of the top teams, including the Russians. Its combined benefits, of having some of the top facilities so close to London, including one of the few Olympic (50m) size pools in the UK, will make it a true asset to whatever team(s) use it.\n*The creation of a health and education research centre near Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital and FE College\n*Investment in the Basildon Enterprise Corridor, the largest business area in the Thames Gateway outside London, home to 45,000 jobs and over 5,000 businesses, including Ford, Selex, Visteon, Case New Holland, [[First Data]] Europe, International Financial Services Limited, RBS, and Starbucks\n*The creation of one of the largest wetland nature reserves in Europe in the Thames Marshes by the RSPB, Land Restoration Trust, Basildon District Council and Veolia\n*A strategic review of the District's housing, with investment in housing estates such as Craylands, Five Links and Felmores to create first class places to live\n\nCoordinating and promoting this programme of investment is the Basildon Renaissance Partnership which was set up in 2003 by Basildon District Council. Its partners also include the East Of England Development Agency, English Partnerships, Essex County Council, and the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership with support from the Department for Communities and Local Government.\n\nThe BBC noted the council had decided to sell for \u00a31 a plot of land it bought next to the golf course for \u00a31m in order to build a 4 star hotel.  The Conservative leader described the sale as an exciting step forward.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47172198|title=Basildon Council to sell land it bought for \u00a31m for \u00a31|work=BBC news|date=8 February 2019|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nThe district is connected to [[London]] and [[Southend-on-sea|Southend]] via two train operators: [[c2c]] and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The route operated by c2c is the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Three principal stations of the railway line are in the district: [[Basildon railway station]], [[Laindon railway station]] and [[Pitsea railway station]]\n\nThe former [[First Great Eastern|Great Eastern]] service (now [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]) operates on the [[Shenfield to Southend Line]]. Trains stop at [[Billericay railway station|Billericay]] and [[Wickford railway station]]. At Wickford, the [[Crouch Valley Line]] diverges from the Shenfield to Southend line.\n\nThree [[Primary status|primary route]]s are within the district. The [[A127 road|A127]] goes through its centre, the [[A13 road (Great Britain)|A13]] goes through the south-east at Pitsea. Both these primary routes connect the district with [[Greater London]] and Southend-on-Sea. At Bowers Gifford at a terminus of the A13's [[primary status]] there is a junction with the beginning of primary status for the [[A130 road|A130]] with runs along a small section of the western boundary of the district. The A130 connects the district with [[Chelmsford]]. The [[A129 road|A129]] is the major road link between Billericay and Wickford, which are linked via [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A-Roads]] to the urban area of Basildon, Pitsea and Laindon by the [[A176 road|A176]] and the [[A132 road (England)|A132]], respectively.\n\n==Freedom of the Borough==\nThe following people and military units have received the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of Basildon.\n \n{{Expand list|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Individuals===\n* [[Max Whitlock]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}}: February 2016.\n* [[Stuart Bingham]]: February 2016.\n* [[Trudi Westmore-Cox]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}}: September 2019.\n* [[Donald Sheppard]]: September 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellowad.co.uk/basildon-war-hero-and-hospice-founder-awarded-freedom-of-the-borough/|title=Basildon war hero and hospice founder awarded Freedom of the Borough|last=Thomson|first=Charles|date=2019-11-25|website=Yellow Advertiser|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Military Units===\n* The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]]: April 2011.\n\n<ref>https://www.basildon.gov.uk/article/3938/Freedom-of-the-Borough?contactid=3046</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://basildon.gov.uk/ Basildon District Home Page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003558/http://www.basildonrenaissance.co.uk/ Basildon Renaissance Partnership]\n* [http://www.basildonheritage.org.uk/ Basildon Heritage]\n* [http://basildonhistory.wix.com/essex Basildon Borough History]\n\n{{Essex}}\n{{East_of_England}}\n{{coord|51.5705|0.4545|type:adm3rd_dim:15000_region:GB-ESS|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basildon, Borough of}}\n[[Category:Borough of Basildon| ]]\n[[Category:Non-metropolitan districts of Essex]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See {{Infobox settlement}} for the full list of available fields -->\n<!-- Elements common to United Kingdom -->\n| official_name           = Borough of Basildon\n| settlement_type         = [[Non-metropolitan district]], [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]]\n| image_skyline           = \n| imagesize               = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| image_shield            =\n| shield_size             = \n| shield_alt              = \n| shield_link             = \n| image_map               = Basildon UK locator map.svg\n| mapsize                 = 150px\n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Basildon shown within Essex\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign state]]\n| subdivision_name        = [[United Kingdom]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Countries of the United Kingdom|Constituent country]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Regions of England|Region]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Non-metropolitan county]]\n| subdivision_type4       = Status\n| subdivision_type5       = Admin HQ\n| subdivision_name1       = [[England]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[East of England]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Essex]]\n| subdivision_name4       = [[Non-metropolitan district]], [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]]\n| subdivision_name5       = [[Basildon]]\n| established_title1      = Incorporated\n| established_date1       = 1 April 1974\n| government_type         = Non-metropolitan district council\n| governing_body          = [[Basildon Borough Council]]\n| leader_party            = {{English district control|GSS=E07000066}}\n| leader_title            = Leadership\n| leader_name             = Committee\n| leader_title1           = [[List of MPs elected in the 2015 United Kingdom general election|MPs]]\n| leader_name1            = [[John Baron (politician)|John Baron]]<br />[[Stephen Metcalfe (politician)|Stephen Metcalfe]]<br />[[Mark Francois]]\n| area_total_km2          = 110.02\n| area_rank               = {{English district area rank|GSS=E07000066}} [[List of English districts by area|(of {{English district total}})]]\n| population_total        = {{English district population|GSS=E07000066}}\n| population_as_of        = {{English statistics year}}\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_rank         = {{English district rank|GSS=E07000066}} [[List of English districts by population|(of {{English district total}})]]\n| population_blank1_title = Ethnicity\n| population_blank1       = 94.5% White<br />2.0% S.

The district was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974 from the former area of [[Basildon Urban District]] and the part of [[Thurrock Urban District]] that was within the Basildon New Town. The population of the district as of 2010 is about 172,000. The council made an application for [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in February 2010 and this was given approval that year, with Cllr Mo Larkin becoming the first mayor in October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062153/http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2011 |title=Basildon to get its first Mayor |publisher=Basildon District Council |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-11315875 | title=Basildon district becomes borough | publisher=BBC News | date=15 September 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011 }}</ref> The local authority is [[Basildon Borough Council]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{see also|Basildon local elections}}\nElections to [[Basildon Borough Council]] are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 42 seats on the council being elected at each election.
