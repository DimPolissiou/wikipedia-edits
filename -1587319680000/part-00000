He starred in some of the  [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' most popular live-action pictures of that period, such as ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949), and ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950). He served as animation model and provided the voice for the title role in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953). In 1950, he received an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for outstanding performance in feature films of 1949, for his roles in ''So Dear to My Heart'' and ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'', both released in 1949.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Driscoll's acting career began to decline, and he turned primarily to guest appearances on [[Anthology series#Television|anthology TV series]]. He became addicted to [[narcotics]] and was sentenced to prison for illicit drug use. After his release, he focused his attention on the [[avant-garde]] art scene. In ill health due to his [[substance abuse]], and with his funds depleted, he died in 1968 in an abandoned building, shortly after his 31st birthday.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Robert Cletus Driscoll in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], the only child of Cletus (1901\u20131969), an insulation salesman, and Isabelle ([[n\u00e9e]] Kratz; 1904\u20131981), a former schoolteacher.

The family moved to [[Los Angeles]] when a doctor advised the father to relocate to California because he was suffering from work-related handling of [[asbestos]].\n\nDriscoll's parents were encouraged to get Bobby into films. Their barber's son, an actor, got Bobby an audition at [[MGM]] for a big role in the 1943 family drama ''[[Lost Angel (film)|Lost Angel]]'', which starred [[Margaret O'Brien]]. While on a tour across the studio lot, five-year-old Driscoll noticed a mock-up ship and asked where the water was.

The first round features 24 contestants (they were introduced from seasons 1-3, but from season 4 onwards, not all were shown) running through a series of obstacles. The top 12 finishing times move on. The show never made clear to viewers whether or how the finishing times are adjusted for failing to complete obstacles along the way.\n\nThe next two rounds take place on two different  complex obstacles. They typically involve large structures that competitors have to enter, navigate around while hostile devices try to knock them off, and then jump to a landing pad to finish, where Jill Wagner awaits them. The competitors keep trying on these structures until roughly half of them have reached the finish; the other half are eliminated. This leaves only the top four (top three in some seasons) to make it to the final round called the Wipeout Zone, where the winner earns the title of Wipeout Champion and a $50,000 grand prize.\n\nThe challenges change each week, but always feature offbeat and comical obstacles, such as the \"Sucker Punch\", \"Big Balls\" (the show's trademark obstacle, four very large red spheres in sequence that must be traversed from a running start, with failures often resulting in odd-angle rejections), the \"Sweeper\", the \"Dizzy Dummy\" or the \"Dreadmill\". Emphasis is always placed on obstacles that can produce sudden jarring collisions (the obstacle surfaces are heavily padded and competitors sometimes don helmets or flak jackets) followed by spectacular falls into the water below, these being the show's titular \"wipeouts\". As part of wiping out, the competitors often end up covered in mud, froth, vats of food, or other unlikely substances.\n\nIn one of the show's trademarks, the commentators have a humorous running commentary, often mocking and insulting the contestants as they compete. The hosts make frequent use of puns. Jokey sound effects and cheesy visual effects are often added as well. The exchanges between the two hosts is often a subplot of episodes themselves, with Anderson playing it mostly straight as a play-by-play man while Henson offers up off-the-wall inanities and non sequiturs as color commentary. \nJill Wagner offers additional features reactions, and also provides interviews with the contestants filmed before their turn begins. These interviews tend to emphasize bizarre aspects of contestants' personalities, with Wagner making facial commentary as the conversation proceeds. Generally only those who will pass the first round are introduced, and a nickname is assigned that is used throughout the game.\n\nAt night, the show takes an epic and serious turn, with the humor dialed down, and serious background music instead of its lighthearted theme music. The final four or three contestants play separately on a large obstacle course inside the studio called the Wipeout Zone, each attempting to finish the course in the fastest time, much like the first round. Though slight variations are used in each episode, contestants wear wetsuits and they begin by either sliding down a water ramp or being launched by a giant catapult or blob into the course, swimming to the first obstacle. Obstacles have varied between episodes, but the course contains several obstacles that must be traversed in order to reach the finishing platform. Some obstacles can be skipped for a time penalty, but the last obstacle(s) has to be completed in order to reach the finishing spot. The player with the fastest time on the course is declared the \"champion\" of the episode and is awarded the show's grand prize of $50,000. The Wipeout Zone often brings competitors to the brink of exhaustion, especially when they have to swim back to a starting point to retry a failed obstacle.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n\n| color1     = #4B0082\n| link1      = Wipeout (season 1)\n| episodes1  = 11\n| start1     = {{Start date|2008|6|28}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2008|9|16}}\n\n| color2     = #5F04B4\n| link2      = Wipeout (season 2)\n| episodes2  = 17\n| start2     = {{Start date|2009|2|1}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2009|9|16}}\n\n| color3     = #0000EE\n| link3      = Wipeout (season 3)\n| episodes3  = 18\n| start3     = {{Start date|2010|6|1}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2010|9|14}}\n\n| color4     = #00CC66\n| link4      = Wipeout (season 4)\n| episodes4  = 31\n| start4     = {{Start date|2011|1|6}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2011|9|15}}\n\n| color5     = #FFFF00\n| link5      = Wipeout (season 5)\n| episodes5  = 24\n| start5     = {{Start date|2011|12|8}}\n| end5       = {{End date|2012|9|29}}\n\n| color6     = #FF8A5F\n| link6      = Wipeout (season 6)\n| episodes6  = 16\n| start6     = {{Start date|2013|5|9}}\n| end6       = {{End date|2013|9|19}}\n\n| color7     = #FF85A4\n| link7      = Wipeout (season 7)\n| episodes7  = 13\n| start7     = {{Start date|2014|6|22}}\n| end7       = {{End date|2014|9|7}}\n\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Image:ABC Wipeout Sable Ranch set storage from above.jpg|thumb|left|The storage area of the ''Wipeout'' set at Sable Ranch, as seen in 2013]]\n\nOn its premiere night, ''Wipeout'' scored the highest premiere rating of any new show in summer 2008, besting competing veteran summer shows ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.<ref name=\"Ratings\">{{cite news|title=Wipeout scores top Tuesday ratings|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if15c9c648a5fa48d2b9e29f95cd82efd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2008-06-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716020222/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if15c9c648a5fa48d2b9e29f95cd82efd|archivedate=2008-07-16}}</ref> As the season progressed, [[Nielsen Media Research]] put it at the top of the 18-49 demographic, slightly outpaced by ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

In the game, the player can choose from 23 different characters. There are four categories of characters, with each category having a certain amount of \"Speed\" and \"Strength\" for the player, which varies based on their body sizes. The \"Small\" characters have great Speed but little Strength. The \"Medium\" characters have a more balanced amount of Speed and Strength, with neither one serving as the dominant trait. And the \"Large\" characters have great Strength but little Speed. These first three categories all have 6 different characters each; 3 females and 3 males, and each character having  3 different outfits. The fourth category is \"Special,\" which has a high amount of Speed and Strength. There are 5 characters in this category, including the three hosts. The game is played in two different versions. Challenge mode is where the player can challenge specific obstacles and attempt to beat them in a certain amount of time. The other is Play The Show, which means to play the game as they would in the show. They go through the Qualifier round first, and advance to the Sweeper round second. The third round, Free For All, has 3 different versions. In the Easy level, the Free For All features players spinning on the dizzy dummy, and then going across the Tipsy Tables or the Spinning Platform. Challenging level has players on the Unclaimed Baggage, and the Extreme level has them on the Double Crosser. Finally, they go through the Wipeout Zone. The [[Wii]] game is different from the show (and its [[Nintendo DS]] counterpart) in that there are only 4 contestants, and none are eliminated during the first three rounds.

The first round features 24 contestants (they were introduced from seasons 1-3, but from season 4 onwards, not all were shown) running through a series of obstacles. The top 12 finishing times move on. The show never made clear to viewers whether or how the finishing times are adjusted for failing to complete obstacles along the way.\n\nThe next two rounds take place on two different  complex obstacles. They typically involve large structures that competitors have to enter, navigate around while hostile devices try to knock them off, and then jump to a landing pad to finish, where Jill Wagner awaits them. The competitors keep trying on these structures until roughly half of them have reached the finish; the other half are eliminated. This leaves only the top four (top three in some seasons) to make it to the final round called the Wipeout Zone, where the winner earns the title of Wipeout Champion and a $50,000 grand prize.\n\nThe challenges change each week, but always feature offbeat and comical obstacles, such as the \"Sucker Punch\", \"Big Balls\" (the show's trademark obstacle, four very large red spheres in sequence that must be traversed from a running start, with failures often resulting in odd-angle rejections), the \"Sweeper\", the \"Dizzy Dummy\" or the \"Dreadmill\". Emphasis is always placed on obstacles that can produce sudden jarring collisions (the obstacle surfaces are heavily padded and competitors sometimes don helmets or flak jackets) followed by spectacular falls into the water below, these being the show's titular \"wipeouts\". As part of wiping out, the competitors often end up covered in mud, froth, vats of food, or other unlikely substances.\n\nIn one of the show's trademarks, the commentators have a humorous running commentary, often mocking and insulting the contestants as they compete. The hosts make frequent use of puns. Jokey sound effects and cheesy visual effects are often added as well. The exchanges between the two hosts is often a subplot of episodes themselves, with Anderson playing it mostly straight as a play-by-play man while Henson offers up off-the-wall inanities and non sequiturs as color commentary. \nJill Wagner offers additional features reactions, and also provides interviews with the contestants filmed before their turn begins. These interviews tend to emphasize bizarre aspects of contestants' personalities, with Wagner making facial commentary as the conversation proceeds. Generally only those who will pass the first round are introduced, and a nickname is assigned that is used throughout the game.\n\nAt night, the show takes an epic and serious turn, with the humor dialed down, and serious background music instead of its lighthearted theme music. The final four or three contestants play separately on a large obstacle course inside the studio called the Wipeout Zone, each attempting to finish the course in the fastest time, much like the first round. Though slight variations are used in each episode, contestants wear wetsuits and they begin by either sliding down a water ramp or being launched by a giant catapult or blob into the course, swimming to the first obstacle. Obstacles have varied between episodes, but the course contains several obstacles that must be traversed in order to reach the finishing platform. Some obstacles can be skipped for a time penalty, but the last obstacle(s) has to be completed in order to reach the finishing spot. The player with the fastest time on the course is declared the \"champion\" of the episode and is awarded the show's grand prize of $50,000. The Wipeout Zone often brings competitors to the brink of exhaustion, especially when they have to swim back to a starting point to retry a failed obstacle.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n\n| color1     = #4B0082\n| link1      = Wipeout (season 1)\n| episodes1  = 11\n| start1     = {{Start date|2008|6|28}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2008|9|16}}\n\n| color2     = #5F04B4\n| link2      = Wipeout (season 2)\n| episodes2  = 17\n| start2     = {{Start date|2009|2|1}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2009|9|16}}\n\n| color3     = #0000EE\n| link3      = Wipeout (season 3)\n| episodes3  = 18\n| start3     = {{Start date|2010|6|1}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2010|9|14}}\n\n| color4     = #00CC66\n| link4      = Wipeout (season 4)\n| episodes4  = 31\n| start4     = {{Start date|2011|1|6}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2011|9|15}}\n\n| color5     = #FFFF00\n| link5      = Wipeout (season 5)\n| episodes5  = 24\n| start5     = {{Start date|2011|12|8}}\n| end5       = {{End date|2012|9|29}}\n\n| color6     = #FF8A5F\n| link6      = Wipeout (season 6)\n| episodes6  = 16\n| start6     = {{Start date|2013|5|9}}\n| end6       = {{End date|2013|9|19}}\n\n| color7     = #FF85A4\n| link7      = Wipeout (season 7)\n| episodes7  = 13\n| start7     = {{Start date|2014|6|22}}\n| end7       = {{End date|2014|9|7}}\n\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Image:ABC Wipeout Sable Ranch set storage from above.jpg|thumb|left|The storage area of the ''Wipeout'' set at Sable Ranch, as seen in 2013]]\n\nOn its premiere night, ''Wipeout'' scored the highest premiere rating of any new show in summer 2008, besting competing veteran summer shows ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.<ref name=\"Ratings\">{{cite news|title=Wipeout scores top Tuesday ratings|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if15c9c648a5fa48d2b9e29f95cd82efd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2008-06-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716020222/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if15c9c648a5fa48d2b9e29f95cd82efd|archivedate=2008-07-16}}</ref> As the season progressed, [[Nielsen Media Research]] put it at the top of the 18-49 demographic, slightly outpaced by ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

Among the charges are that ABC bought search terms such as ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge|MXC]]'' (the Americanized comedy version of ''Takeshi's Castle'') on Google to help drive traffic to the official ''Wipeout'' page, and that specific obstacles in ''Wipeout'' were knock-offs of challenges in those Japanese game shows. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n''Wipeout'' creator and executive producer [[Matt Kunitz]], who also executive produced Endemol's ''[[Fear Factor]]'' (NBC), said ''Wipeout'' is \"90% Fear Factor-inspired, 10% Japanese game show\", adding in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interview that ''Wipeout'' was born from a desire to do a funny stunt series.

In the game, the player can choose from 23 different characters. There are four categories of characters, with each category having a certain amount of \"Speed\" and \"Strength\" for the player, which varies based on their body sizes. The \"Small\" characters have great Speed but little Strength. The \"Medium\" characters have a more balanced amount of Speed and Strength, with neither one serving as the dominant trait. And the \"Large\" characters have great Strength but little Speed. These first three categories all have 6 different characters each; 3 females and 3 males, and each character having  3 different outfits. The fourth category is \"Special,\" which has a high amount of Speed and Strength. There are 5 characters in this category, including the three hosts. The game is played in two different versions. Challenge mode is where the player can challenge specific obstacles and attempt to beat them in a certain amount of time. The other is Play The Show, which means to play the game as they would in the show. They go through the Qualifier round first, and advance to the Sweeper round second. The third round, Free For All, has 3 different versions. In the Easy level, the Free For All features players spinning on the dizzy dummy, and then going across the Tipsy Tables or the Spinning Platform. Challenging level has players on the Unclaimed Baggage, and the Extreme level has them on the Double Crosser. Finally, they go through the Wipeout Zone. The [[Wii]] game is different from the show (and its [[Nintendo DS]] counterpart) in that there are only 4 contestants, and none are eliminated during the first three rounds. The game has commentary by Henson, Anderson and Wagner, all three of whom are featured as unlockable playable characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gofanboy.com/go-fanboy-news/2168-activision-announces-wipeout-the-game-for-nintendo-ds-and-wii|title=www.gofanboy.com |publisher=www.gofanboy.com|date=2010-03-19|accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAnother Wipeout game was under development by [[Activision]], this time for [[Xbox 360]] with [[Kinect]], entitled 'Wipeout: In The Zone'.

He was raised by his aunts and, after their marriages, with other family members. According to the courtesan Gramiz, Carlos was spoiled, emotionally unstable, and not very bright. He was educated in the [[Universidad de Alcal\u00e1]] de Henares along with [[Juan of Austria]] and [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese]].\n\nThe descriptions of his behaviour suggest that he suffered from some serious mental problems. Rumour in the Spanish court had it that he enjoyed roasting animals alive and in one occasion blinded all the horses in the royal stables. At age eleven he ordered the whipping of a serving girl for no known reason. The Venetian ambassador, Hieronymo Soranzo, thought that Carlos was \"ugly and repulsive\" and claimed that Carlos liked to roast animals alive and once tried to force a shoemaker to eat shoes Carlos had found unsatisfactory. Another Venetian, Paolo Tiepolo, wrote: \"He [Prince Carlos] wished neither to study nor to take physical exercise, but only to harm others.\"<ref>Marshall pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez-Molero has tried to argue that those reports were just rumours, based on his investigations regarding Carlos's personal library - even though there is no guarantee that he read the books in it. From 1554, Honorary Juan was in charge of both his education and his library. Said library was based on books on Spanish history, Aragonese history, Portuguese history, Mathematics, Astronomy and Cartography. He had no books in Latin, which was strange given his age and rank, but he had various books in Portuguese and started learning German in 1566. It is suggested that the accident of 1562 didn't damage his intellectual ability, even though this is unclear.<ref>Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez-Molero, Jos\u00e9 Luis (2004). \u00abLectura y bibliofilia en el pr\u00edncipe don Carlos (1545\u20131568), o la alucinada b\u00fasqueda de la 'sabidur\u00eda'\u00bb.

The former emperor died in 1558, and the following year, Prince Carlos was betrothed to [[Elizabeth of Valois]], eldest daughter of King [[Henry II of France]]. However, for political reasons, and for his father's mistrust on Carlos's temper, she instead married his father, King Philip, in 1560.\n\nHis health was always weak.

In 1561 the doctors of the court recommended him to move permanently to [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]] for his health, as the climate was milder. Carlos constantly complained about his father's resistance to giving him positions of authority. Finally, the King gave him a position in the [[Council of Castile]] and another in the [[Council of Aragon]]. This only made Carlos more furious, since both organisations were important but ultimately consultative. He showed no interest in the councils or in familiarising himself with political matters through them.<ref>Relaci\u00f3n del doctor Dionisio Daza Chac\u00f3n sobre la herida de cabeza del pr\u00edncipe Carlos; CODOIN, vol.XVIII, pags. 537\u2013563</ref>\n\n===Inheritance and head injury===\nThree other brides were then suggested for the Prince: [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]; [[Margaret of Valois]], youngest daughter of Henry II of France; and [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anna of Austria]], who was later to become Philip's fourth wife, and was a daughter of Philip's cousin, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian II]] and Philip's sister Maria. It was agreed in 1564 that Carlos should marry Anna.<ref>Kamen p. 120</ref> His father promised him rule over the Low Countries in 1559, before his accident, but Carlos's growing mental instability after it, along with his demonstrations of sadism, made his father hesitate and ultimately change his mind, which enraged Carlos further.<ref name=\"P\u00e9rez, Joseph 2014\">P\u00e9rez, Joseph. \u00abEl Pr\u00edncipe Don Carlos, un problema de Estado para Felipe II\u00bb, Conferencia extraordinaria en la XXVIII edici\u00f3n de los Cursos de Verano de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, a cargo de Joseph P\u00e9rez, Premio Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias de Ciencias Sociales 2014, 22 de julio de 2015</ref>\n\nThe 15 year old Carlos was recognised in 1560 as the heir-apparent to the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] throne, and three years later as heir-apparent to the [[Crown of Aragon]] as well. Also, had he lived long enough to the onset of the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580#Genealogical summary|Portuguese succession crisis]] two decades later, he would have [[Primogeniture#Male-preference primogeniture|a better claim]] to the Portuguese throne (in the aftermath of the extinction of the House of Aviz) than his father as he was the eldest surviving grandson of [[John III of Portugal|King John III of Portugal]]. As such of his eminence, he often attended meetings of the Council of State (which dealt with foreign affairs) and was in correspondence with his aunt [[Margaret of Parma|Margaret]], who governed the [[Low Countries]] in his father's name.<ref>Parker p. 89</ref>\n[[File:Jooris van der straten-don carlos-descalzas.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Don Carlos by [[Jooris van der Straeten]]]]\nIn 1562, he suffered a serious head injury falling downstairs while chasing a serving girl. The prince was close to death, in terrible pain and suffering [[delusion]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> After trying all sorts of remedies, including doctors of all types, healers, and even the relics of [[Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], his life was saved by a [[trepanation]] of the skull, performed by the eminent [[anatomist]] [[Andreas Vesalius]].<ref>Parker p. 88</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> After his recovery, Carlos became even wilder, more unstable in his temper and unpredictable in his behaviour.<ref name=\":0\" /> His father was forced to move him away from any position of power.<ref name=\"P\u00e9rez, Joseph 2014\"/> He took a dislike to the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], who became the commander of Philip's forces in the Netherlands, a position that had been promised to Carlos.\n\n===Insanity, treason and attempted patricide===\nHis frustration and mental problems were useful for the rebel factions in the Low Countries. In 1565, Carlos made contacts with a representative of [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Count Egmont]] and Philip of Montmorency, from the Low Countries, who were among the leaders of the revolt against Philip. He planned on fleeing to the Netherlands and declaring himself king, with the support of the rebels. In one of his chaotic actions he confessed the plot to [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva]], Prince of Eboli, who loyally informed the king.\n\nIn 1566, [[Floris of Montmorency]] established new contacts with him in the name of [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Count Egmont]] and Philip of Montmorency, to repeat the previous plot.\n\nIn 1567, the prince gave new proofs of mental instability. During a walk, water thrown from a window accidentally splashed him. He ordered the house to be set on fire. He tried to stab and kill the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] in public and in broad daylight. He tried to throw a servant who bothered him through the window of the highest floor of the palace, and also tried to kill a guard who had also displeased him that same year.<ref name=\"Parker, Geoffrey 2002 p II\">Parker, Geoffrey (2002).

John was loyal to the king and aware of Carlos's mental state. He asked for 24 hours to think about it and used them to consult the plan with the king who immediately denied permission for the trip.<ref name=\"Parker p. 90\">Parker p. 90</ref>\n\nAs a consequence, Carlos tried to murder John. He charged his gun and called John of Austria to his room, where he tried to shoot him repeatedly. The attempted assassination was fruitless because one of the servants, knowing the prince full well, had discharged the gun while the prince called John. Carlos got so irate that he tried to attack John with his bare hands. He eventually informed various people in court of his desire to murder the King. There is debate about whether he actually tried to do so. After that incident, Philip imprisoned the prince in his rooms without receiving correspondence and with limited contacts with the exterior world.<ref name=\"Parker, Geoffrey 2002 p II\"/>\n\nJust before midnight on 17 January 1568, Philip II, in armour, and with four councillors, entered Don Carlos' bedchamber in the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Alc\u00e1zar of Madrid]] where they declared his arrest, seized his papers and weapons, and nailed up the windows.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kamen p. 121; Parker pp. 90, 92</ref> Since Carlos threatened ending his own life, the king banned him from having knives or forks in his room. Carlos also tried a [[hunger strike]], in which he failed.\n\n===Death===\nWhen it came to explaining the situation to public opinion and European courts, Philip tried to explain his son's absence without disclosing his actual faults or mental condition, in hopes of an eventual recovery. This lack of transparency was used to fuel the anti-Imperial propaganda of [[William the Silent]]. On 24 July 1568, the prince died in his room, probably as the result of his delicate health. His death was used as one of the core elements of the [[Spanish Black Legend]] in the Netherlands, which needed to justify a revolt against the king. It was later claimed that he was poisoned on the orders of King Philip, especially by William in his ''Apology'', a 1581 propaganda work against the Spanish king.<ref name=\"Parker pp. 92\u201393, 201\">Parker pp. 92\u201393, 201</ref> The idea of the poisoning had been held by central and north European historians, based on the pieces of propaganda produced in the Netherlands, until the 20th century, while most Spanish and Italian historians kept claiming that evidence and documentation pointed at a death by natural causes.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez, Manuel (2006). \u00ab1568: Annus horribilis-El pr\u00edncipe don Carlos p.395-425\u00bb.

The Black Legend: Anti-Spanish Attitudes in the Old World and the New. 1971.</ref>  The propaganda created from it formed the basis for [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s 1787 [[tragedy]] [[Don Carlos (play)|''Don Karlos, Infant von Spanien'']]; Schiller's play was adapted into several [[Don Carlos (play)#Opera adaptations|opera]]s, most notably [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlos]]''. Schiller based his work on a novel written in 1672 by the French Abb\u00e9, [[C\u00e9sar Vichard de Saint-R\u00e9al]], which was also the source used by the English writer [[Thomas Otway]] for his play ''Don Carlos, Prince of Spain''. In both works, romantic tragedies that combine nationalism and romantic love, Carlos incarnates the ideal of the romantic knight, noble and brave. He is presented as the lover of young Isabel of Valois, Philip's wife, as they both fight for freedom and for their love against a cruel, despotic, merciless, and far-too-old-for-Isabel Philip II and his court of equally cruel and despotic Spaniards. Finally the hero is defeated by treason due to his excess of nobility.<ref>\u00abDon Carlos\u00bb. Instituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani.

He showed no interest in the councils or in familiarising himself with political matters through them.<ref>Relaci\u00f3n del doctor Dionisio Daza Chac\u00f3n sobre la herida de cabeza del pr\u00edncipe Carlos; CODOIN, vol.XVIII, pags. 537\u2013563</ref>\n\n===Inheritance and head injury===\nThree other brides were then suggested for the Prince: [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]; [[Margaret of Valois]], youngest daughter of Henry II of France; and [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anna of Austria]], who was later to become Philip's fourth wife, and was a daughter of Philip's cousin, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian II]] and Philip's sister Maria. It was agreed in 1564 that Carlos should marry Anna.<ref>Kamen p. 120</ref> His father promised him rule over the Low Countries in 1559, before his accident, but Carlos's growing mental instability after it, along with his demonstrations of sadism, made his father hesitate and ultimately change his mind, which enraged Carlos further.<ref name=\"P\u00e9rez, Joseph 2014\">P\u00e9rez, Joseph. \u00abEl Pr\u00edncipe Don Carlos, un problema de Estado para Felipe II\u00bb, Conferencia extraordinaria en la XXVIII edici\u00f3n de los Cursos de Verano de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, a cargo de Joseph P\u00e9rez, Premio Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias de Ciencias Sociales 2014, 22 de julio de 2015</ref>\n\nThe 15 year old Carlos was recognised in 1560 as the heir-apparent to the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] throne, and three years later as heir-apparent to the [[Crown of Aragon]] as well. Also, had he lived long enough to the onset of the [[Portuguese_succession_crisis_of_1580#Genealogical_summary|Portuguese succession crisis]] two decades later, he would have [[Primogeniture#Male-preference_primogeniture|a better claim]] to the Portuguese throne (in the aftermath of the extinction of the House of Aviz) than his father as he was the eldest surviving grandson of [[John III of Portugal|King John III of Portugal]]. As such of his eminence, he often attended meetings of the Council of State (which dealt with foreign affairs) and was in correspondence with his aunt [[Margaret of Parma|Margaret]], who governed the [[Low Countries]] in his father's name.<ref>Parker p. 89</ref>\n[[File:Jooris van der straten-don carlos-descalzas.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Don Carlos by [[Jooris van der Straeten]]]]\nIn 1562, he suffered a serious head injury falling downstairs while chasing a serving girl.

In 1565, Carlos made contacts with a representative of [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Count Egmont]] and Philip of Montmorency, from the Low Countries, who were among the leaders of the revolt against Philip. He planned on fleeing to the Netherlands and declaring himself king, with the support of the rebels. In one of his chaotic actions he confessed the plot to [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva]], Prince of Eboli, who loyally informed the king.\n\nIn 1566, [[Floris of Montmorency]] established new contacts with him in the name of [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Count Egmont]] and Philip of Montmorency, to repeat the previous plot.\n\nIn 1567, the prince gave new proofs of mental instability. During a walk, water thrown from a window accidentally splashed him. He ordered the house to be set on fire. He tried to stab and kill the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] in public and in broad daylight. He tried to throw a servant who bothered him through the window of the highest floor of the palace, and also tried to kill a guard who had also displeased him that same year.<ref name=\"Parker, Geoffrey 2002 p II\">Parker, Geoffrey (2002).

John was loyal to the king and aware of Carlos's mental state. He asked for 24 hours to think about it and used them to consult the plan with the king who immediately denied permission for the trip.<ref name=\"Parker p. 90\">Parker p. 90</ref>\n\nAs a consequence, Carlos tried to murder John. He charged his gun and called John of Austria to his room, where he tried to shoot him repeatedly. The attempted assassination was fruitless because one of the servants, knowing the prince full well, had discharged the gun while the prince called John. Carlos got so irate that he tried to attack John with his bare hands. He eventually informed various people in court of his desire to murder the King. There is debate about whether he actually tried to do so. After that incident, Philip imprisoned the prince in his rooms without receiving correspondence and with limited contacts with the exterior world.<ref name=\"Parker, Geoffrey 2002 p II\"/>\n\nJust before midnight on 17 January 1568, Philip II, in armour, and with four councillors, entered Don Carlos' bedchamber in the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Alc\u00e1zar of Madrid]] where they declared his arrest, seized his papers and weapons, and nailed up the windows.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kamen p. 121; Parker pp. 90, 92</ref> Since Carlos threatened ending his own life, the king banned him from having knives or forks in his room. Carlos also tried a [[hunger strike]], in which he failed.\n\n===Death===\nWhen it came to explaining the situation to public opinion and European courts, Philip tried to explain his son's absence without disclosing his actual faults or mental condition, in hopes of an eventual recovery. This lack of transparency was used to fuel the anti-Imperial propaganda of [[William the Silent]]. On 24 July, 1568, the prince died in his room, probably as the result of his delicate health. His death was used as one of the core elements of the [[Spanish Black Legend]] in the Netherlands, which needed to justify a revolt against the king. It was later claimed that he was poisoned on the orders of King Philip, especially by William in his ''Apology'', a 1581 propaganda work against the Spanish king.<ref name=\"Parker pp. 92\u201393, 201\">Parker pp. 92\u201393, 201</ref> The idea of the poisoning had been held by central and north European historians, based on the pieces of propaganda produced in the Netherlands, until the 20th century, while most Spanish and Italian historians kept claiming that evidence and documentation pointed at a death by natural causes.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez, Manuel (2006). \u00ab1568: Annus horribilis-El pr\u00edncipe don Carlos p.395-425\u00bb.

Schiller based his work on a novel written in 1672 by the French Abb\u00e9, [[C\u00e9sar Vichard de Saint-R\u00e9al]], which was also the source used by the English writer [[Thomas Otway]] for his play ''Don Carlos, Prince of Spain''. In both works, romantic tragedies that combine nationalism and romantic love, Carlos incarnates the ideal of the romantic knight, noble and brave. He is presented as the lover of young Isabel of Valois, Philip's wife, as they both fight for freedom and for their love against a cruel, despotic, merciless, and far-too-old-for-Isabel Philip II and his court of equally cruel and despotic Spaniards.

Indeed, modern British sea bass fishermen look to the United States freshwater bass techniques for inspiration for lure fishing and to the US, Japan and China for tackle. During the early-to-mid-19th century, wealthy sport anglers in the United States (mostly located in the northeastern portion of the country) largely confined themselves to trout and salmon fishing using [[fly fishing|fly rods]].  While [[smallmouth bass]] were sought by some fly fishermen,<ref name=\"HEN\"/> most bass fishing was done by sustenance anglers using [[fishing rod|poles]] and live bait.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  The working-class heritage of bass fishing strongly influenced the sport and is manifested even today in its terminology, hobbyist literature, and media coverage.<ref name=\"WAT\"/> Many people who began fishing for bass a long time ago simply used a long stick, with some sort of line, tied to a hook, and normally used live bait. It is amazing to take note of how far along the fishing industry has come along. \n\nIn the mid-19th century, the first artificial lure used for bass was developed in the form of an [[artificial fly]].<ref name=\"HEN\"/>  At first, these artificial fly patterns were largely derivations of existing trout and salmon [[Artificial fly|flies]].<ref name=\"HEN\"/>  As time went on, new fly patterns were specifically developed to fish for bass, as well as heavier spinner/fly lures that could be cast by the baitcasting and fixed-spool casting [[fishing reel|reels]] and [[fishing rod|rods]] available at the time.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\">Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod'', Lyons & Burford Publishers (1996)</ref>  Floating wooden lures (plugs) or poppers of lightweight cork or balsa were introduced around 1900, sometimes combined with hooks dressed with artificial fur or feathers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Production of the plastic worm began in 1949, but it was not until the 1960s that its use became popular. The plastic worm revolutionized the sport of bass fishing.<ref>[http://probassfishingsecrets.com ''Pro Bass Secrets: Fishing Tips for Bass'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620203225/http://probassfishingsecrets.com/ |date=June 20, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the sport of bass fishing was greatly advanced by the stocking of largemouth and smallmouth bass outside their native ranges in the latter portion of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HEN\"/><ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />  As the nation's [[railroad]] system expanded, large numbers of 'tank' ponds were built by damming various small creeks that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for [[steam engine]]s; later, new towns often sprang up alongside these [[water stop]]s.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />  Shippers found that black bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels via the railroad, sometimes using the spigot from the railroad water tank to aerate the fingerlings.<ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n[[Image:Angler largemouth.jpg|thumb|left|''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in Connecticut]]\n\nLargemouth bass were often stocked in tank ponds and warmer lakes, while smallmouth bass were distributed to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far west as California.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Smallmouth were transplanted east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards introduced into New England.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref>Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod, Lyons & Burford Publishers'' (1996)</ref>\n\nLargemouth bass populations boomed after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began to advise and assist farmers in constructing and stocking farm ponds with largemouth bass, even offering advice on managing various fish species.  Soon, those who had stocked largemouth bass on their farm ponds began to pursue them on a burgeoning number of new reservoirs and impoundments built in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.  These impoundments coincided with a postwar fishing boom, additional funds from sales of fishing licenses for the first large-scale attempts at bass fisheries management.  This was especially true in the southern United States, where the largemouth bass thrived in waters too warm or turbid for other types of gamefish.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n\nWith increased industrialization and development, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were dammed, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native [[brook trout]].  Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range.  Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and industrial and agricultural pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers in order to form lakes or reservoirs.  In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n\n==Rise of modern bass fishing==\n[[Image:Largemothbassbaby.JPG|right|thumb|Example of a very young specimen of ''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in [[Minnesota]]]]\nBy the early 20th century, bass fishing had been well established as a sport with its own following.  Though the use of artificial lures for bass had begun with the [[artificial fly]] and [[fly fishing]] tackle, the bait casting rod and reel soon came to dominate the sport.  Although fixed-spool reels were introduced in use in the United States as early as the 1870s,<ref name=\"HEN\"/> [[fishing reel|spinning]] reels and [[fishing rod|rods]] did not gain wide acceptance as an angling tool until the 1950s.<ref>playboy.com [http://www.orcaonline.org/reel_history.htm O.R.C.A. Online, Reel History]</ref>  Since that time, most bass anglers have used bait casting or spinning tackle, using either artificial lures or live bait (See [[Fishing rod]], [[Fishing reel]]).<ref name=\"WAT\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the development of specific angling tools for bass significantly increased angler bass catches and helped stimulate the development of the sport.  Some of these innovations include the invention of monofilament nylon fishing lines, the [[fiberglass]] (later [[graphite]] composite) fishing rod, the electric trolling motor, the fish finder/depth locator, and new artificial lures and baits made of various plastics. Recently, advanced electronics that mimic the sounds of schooling [[bait fish]] have been introduced, and a controversy has arisen over the proper use of these devices in bass tournament fishing.\n\nSince the early 1990s, [[fly fishing]] for bass, particularly smallmouth bass, has again become popular, using fly patterns, [[fishing rod|rods]], and [[fly fishing|fly lines]] suited for bass.<ref>Murray, Harry, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&product_code=1%2D55821%2D534%2D4&category_code= Fly Fishing for Smallmouth Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 1989</ref><ref>Kreh, Lefty, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&product_code=1%2D59228%2D310%2D1&category_code= Fly Fishing for Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 2004</ref> The Largemouth Bass is the most common sport fish in America.

Outside North America, [[Japan]] and [[South Africa]] have active programs.\nBass fishing as a sport was helped along by the chase for the standing world record which has held for over 75 years. Though surrounded by controversy it is widely accepted that in 1932 a 22-pound 4 ounce bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake, Georgia. It is one of the longest standing records in the sport of fishing. This record was tied on July 2, 2009 when Aichi Japan resident Manabu Kurita caught a 22-pound 4 ounce largemouth bass in [[Lake Biwa]].<ref>International Game and Fish Association [http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&cn=Bass,%20largemouth Largemouth Bass All-Tackle World Record]</ref>\n\n==Population management==\n[[Image:Bassboat1.jpg|thumb|Typical aluminium bass boat with gas motor and electric trolling motor]]\n[[Image:Bassboat2.jpg|thumb|Center console aluminum bass boat]]\nThe increasing popularity of the sport combined with \"catch and release\" practices have in some cases led to an [[overpopulation]] of bass.\n\nAn overpopulated, stunted bass population can best be detected in the spring when all the bass are at least one year old. If virtually all the bass are 4&nbsp;inches long or smaller, the population is probably stunted. Some indicators that a bass population is overpopulated:\n\n# The largemouth bass caught are all less than 1 pound and are \"skinny\".\n# The bluegills are 1/2 pound and larger (too large for the bass to eat).\n\nAn overpopulation and/or stunting of bass may be caused by several factors including:\n\n# Not enough bass being harvested.\n# Too few bluegill or redear sunfish were stocked initially or they are failing to reproduce and the bass population does not have an adequate food supply.\n\nIt is posited that the easiest way to control an overpopulation of largemouth bass is by increasing the take of bass. This is clearly an effective method of thinning the bass population providing recreation at the same time. It may take two to three years to bring the population back into balance. If [[forage fish]] are scarce, stock adult bluegill or redear sunfish (7 to 8&nbsp;inches long). These fish will be too large to be eaten by the bass. The large panfish will spawn in the spring and produce a supply\nof forage.

This organization brought bass fishing tournaments to the mainstream; starting clubs across the United States and holding invitation only tournaments for the best anglers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/news/bass-historical-timeline-0|title=B.A.S.S. historical timeline|last=Labm|first=Craig|date=2018-01-30|website=Bassmaster|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n\nModern day bass fishing competitions can take on many forms depending on the tournament trail, but the most common format is each angler weighs their 5 best fish each day over a 1 to 4 day span.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/sites/default/files/2018_bass_nation_rules_pro_am_final_v3.pdf|title=BASS Nation Rules|date=February 2, 2019|website=Bassmaster}}</ref> Competitors are penalized heavily for dead fish and in some cases dead fish are not weighed. Fish turned in for weighing are immediately released or placed in tanks and treated for stress and glyco-protein (slime coat) injury, then released back into the water.\n\nHowever, a new tournament trail known as Major League Fishing emerged in 2019 with a new format - weighing in every fish over 1 pound and immediately releasing them. This caught the eye of many top professional anglers, leading to a mass exodus from B.A.S.S.<ref name=\"wired2fish.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired2fish.com/news/full-list-of-anglers-fishing-mlf-bass-pro-tour/|title=Full List of Anglers Fishing MLF Bass Pro Tour|website=wired2fish.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nThere are several major bass fishing competitions in the United States, with the three most dominant circuits being Major League Fishing, Bassmasters and the FLW series.\n\n* Major League Fishing is a new trail for 2019 and organized by Bass Pro Shops. The trail brought over professionals like [[Michael Iaconelli]], [[Kevin VanDam]], Aaron Martens, [[Cliff Pace]] and [[Luke Clausen]].<ref name=\"wired2fish.com\"/>\n*The ''Bassmaster Tournament Trail'' is organized by the [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS) and was started by [[Ray Scott (angler)|Ray Scott]], the \"father\" of competitive bass fishing. There are a handful of events in which anglers compete for prizing over $100,000 and a chance to make [[Bassmaster Classic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/2019-tournament-schedule|title=2019 Tournament Schedule|date=2018-07-09|website=Bassmaster|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n* The ''Walmart FLW Tour'' was named after [[Forrest L. Wood]] of [[Ranger Boats]] fame. The top prize of the Forrest Wood Cup is $1 million. Both tours are nationally televised on networks like [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports Net]], and covered extensively by [[news media]].\n* American Bass Anglers (ABA), formerly the Military Bass Anglers Association,  award National championship tournament winners with a Triton Bass boat and Championship ring amongst other prizes.  Thomas Wayne Jones, Sr., from Springfield Tennessee won the 2007 ABA National championship.\n* On the West Coast, WON BASS has been the main regional circuit in operation since the 1980s. Annually, WON BASS conducts the ''U.S. Open of Bass Fishing'' at [[Lake Mead, Nevada]], which pays back nearly $500,000 per event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wonbass.com/|website=WON BASS|title=WON BASS Tournaments|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}</ref> This is a test of both angling skill and endurance as the anglers compete for 3 days in the scorching hot sun and windy conditions of the [[Mojave Desert]]. Renowned anglers Rick Clunn, Byron Velvick, Aaron Martens, and Gary Klein have all been crowned champions during the Open's 25-year history.\n\n==== High school ====\n\nThe state of Illinois was the first to make competitive bass fishing a state-sanctioned high school sport in 2009. They offer 22 sectional tournaments which cater to 250 high school teams across the state. Teams which qualify at the sectional level compete for the state title in May.\n\nStates across the country have taken to Illinois' lead. Kentucky was the second to follow suit in 2012. Private groups have seen the opportunity to grow the industry as well through exposure of high school student to tournament bass fishing. The Bass Federation, for example, offers high school tournament series in over 40 states, eventually crowning a State Champion and giving them the opportunity to compete on the national level.\n\n==== Collegiate ====\n{{See also|Intercollegiate sports team champions#Fishing}}\n\nCompetitive collegiate bass fishing circuits in the United States include FLW College Fishing, the Bassmaster College Series, and Cabela's Collegiate Bass Fishing Series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schonbrun|first1=Zach|title=Collegiate Fishing's Added Lure: Cash on the Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/sports/a-paycheck-for-college-athletes-join-the-fishing-team.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 18, 2014|pages=A1 ff}}</ref>\n\nThe FLW College Series includes three regional qualifiers in each of the five regions of the United States denoted by FLW. The top fifteen finishing teams in each of these regional qualifiers advance to the Regional Invitational tournament and have an opportunity to advance to the FLW College National Championship and fish for a place in the following year's Forrest L Woods Cup Professional Bass Tournament.\n\nSimilarly, the Bassmaster College Series divides the nation into 5 regions. They only offer one qualifying opportunity at the regional level as opposed to the three offered by the FLW College Series. The top 15 from each of the 5 regional qualifiers advance directly to the Bassmaster College Series National Champion and compete for a position in the following year's Bassmaster Classic.\n\nThe Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series is compiled of numerous tournaments accredited by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. The tournaments range in size from 20-30 boats all the way up to 100+ boats. The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series compiles a ranking of \"School of the Year\" points, which are often coveted by schools across the country. These points are gathered through successful tournament finishes in tournaments recognized by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series also hosts a large-scale national open. This is not the only one of its kind, as BoatUS also hosts a similar \"National Championship.\" Unlike the Bassmaster College Series and FLW College Series National Championships, these require no qualification from regional tournaments, and can be entered simply by signing up and paying the entry fee.\n\nIndiana University was the first to establish a tournament fishing club in 1989, with Purdue University creating one soon afterwards. The University of Illinois was third to make a tournament bass fishing student organization, and the trend has grown tremendously ever since.\n\n=== Other countries ===\n\nCompetitive bass fishing has also spread to anglers in other countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. Takahiro Omori, a Japanese angler living in Texas, won the 2004 Bassmaster Classic title. Australian tournaments are based on a native freshwater fish called [[Australian bass]] that is unrelated to largemouth bass.\n\n== Professional Bass Angling ==\nWith the rise in popularity of competitive bass fishing came the multibillion-dollar industry of professional bass angling.  The rise in popularity and the companies that have supported the sport have now made it possible to turn bass angling into a professional sport.  A professional bass angler is a person who competes in bass fishing pro circuit and may also have company sponsorships.  Some famous pro circuits include [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS), [[FLW Outdoors|Walmart FLW Tour]], and the [[Major League Fishing]] (MLF) Bass Pro Tour (BPT) .<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/how-to-become-pro-bass-angler/|title=How to Become a Pro Bass Angler|last=Samsel|first=Jeff|date=Feb 28, 2012|website=Game and Fish Mag|publisher=n.p.|access-date=April 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427004559/http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/how-to-become-pro-bass-angler/|archive-date=2016-04-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Events-Major League Fishing https://majorleaguefishing.com/events/bass-pro-tour/</ref>\n\nProfessional bass anglers are not able to simply sign up for these professional circuits.  The angler must compete and win local and smaller events to in order create a reputation.  Many professional bass anglers also get company sponsorships.  These sponsorships help fund the expenses of being a bass angler.  In turn the angler is also promoting the company that they are sponsored by.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/bassmaster-classic/post/how-to-become-a-pro-and-fish-in-the-bassmaster-classic|title=Fishing Central How To Become A Pro And Fish In The Bassmaster Classic - World Fishing Network|last=Network|first=World Fishing|date=2012-02-21|website=World Fishing Network|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601153747/http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/bassmaster-classic/post/how-to-become-a-pro-and-fish-in-the-bassmaster-classic|archive-date=2016-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Being a professional bass angler is a full-time job.

Ray Scott started BASS in 1967 and has paved the way for professional circuits by starting the BASS Tournament Trail.  Kevin VanDam is a professional competition angler who has won the BASSMASTER Classic four times. He also gained great fame by being named Angler of the Year in 1992.  Mike Iaconelli is a professional competition angler in the BASS Elite Series, who has made a name for himself by winning BASSMASTER Classic and the Toyota Elite Series AOY<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wideopenspaces.com/20-famous-bass-anglers-time-2/|title=20 Most Famous Bass Anglers of All Time - Wide Open Spaces|date=2014-10-12|website=Wide Open Spaces|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\nProfessional bass angling salaries fluctuate greatly depending on how marketable the angler is, in 2006 Kevin VanDam made $500,000 from his sponsors while Mike Iaconelli made $370,000.  This does not include the prize money from winning competitions.  Although there are some professionals that earn this much money, it is not the case for all of them.  Gene Ellison the executive director of the Professional Anglers Association is quoted saying, \"more than half of the guys out here this weekend are going broke\", during the BASSMASTER Classic of 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/news/show-me-money|title=Show me the Money|website=Bassmaster|access-date=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years the sport has not only reached out to men but to women as well.  There is a large following of women bass fishing who are trying to become professional and have their own women circuit.  The Lady Bass Anglers Association was started for just that purpose.  They aspire to create an industry in which women are able to compete professionally and help push the boundaries of professional bass angling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ladybassanglers.com/our-team/mission-statement.html|title=Mission Statement for the Lady Bass Anglers Association|website=www.ladybassanglers.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Double Whammy (novel)|Double Whammy]]'' (novel)\n*[[Striped bass fishing]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Edwin A. |title=Bass In America-The Haunts, habits and other secrets of one of the worlds' finest freshwater game fish |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=1955 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Bergman |first=Ray |title=Fresh-water Bass |year=1942 |publisher=William Penn Publishing Co. |location=New York }}\n* {{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Joe |authorlink=  |title=Bass Bug Fishing |year=1947 |publisher=A.

During the early-to-mid-19th century, wealthy sport anglers in the United States (mostly located in the northeastern portion of the country) largely confined themselves to trout and salmon fishing using [[fly fishing|fly rods]].  While [[smallmouth bass]] were sought by some fly fishermen,<ref name=\"HEN\"/> most bass fishing was done by sustenance anglers using [[fishing rod|poles]] and live bait.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  The working-class heritage of bass fishing strongly influenced the sport and is manifested even today in its terminology, hobbyist literature, and media coverage.<ref name=\"WAT\"/> Many people who began fishing for bass a long time ago simply used a long stick, with some sort of line, tied to a hook, and normally used live bait. It is amazing to take note of how far along the fishing industry has come along. \n\nIn the mid-19th century, the first artificial lure used for bass was developed in the form of an [[artificial fly]].<ref name=\"HEN\"/>  At first, these artificial fly patterns were largely derivations of existing trout and salmon [[Artificial fly|flies]].<ref name=\"HEN\"/>  As time went on, new fly patterns were specifically developed to fish for bass, as well as heavier spinner/fly lures that could be cast by the baitcasting and fixed-spool casting [[fishing reel|reels]] and [[fishing rod|rods]] available at the time.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\">Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod'', Lyons & Burford Publishers (1996)</ref>  Floating wooden lures (plugs) or poppers of lightweight cork or balsa were introduced around 1900, sometimes combined with hooks dressed with artificial fur or feathers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Production of the plastic worm began in 1949, but it was not until the 1960s that its use became popular. The plastic worm revolutionized the sport of bass fishing.<ref>[http://probassfishingsecrets.com ''Pro Bass Secrets: Fishing Tips for Bass'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620203225/http://probassfishingsecrets.com/ |date=June 20, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the sport of bass fishing was greatly advanced by the stocking of largemouth and smallmouth bass outside their native ranges in the latter portion of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HEN\"/><ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />  As the nation's [[railroad]] system expanded, large numbers of 'tank' ponds were built by damming various small creeks that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for [[steam engine]]s; later, new towns often sprang up alongside these [[water stop]]s.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />  Shippers found that black bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels via the railroad, sometimes using the spigot from the railroad water tank to aerate the fingerlings.<ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n[[Image:Angler largemouth.jpg|thumb|left|''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in Connecticut]]\n\nLargemouth bass were often stocked in tank ponds and warmer lakes, while smallmouth bass were distributed to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far west as California.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Smallmouth were transplanted east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards introduced into New England.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref>Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod, Lyons & Burford Publishers'' (1996)</ref>\n\nLargemouth bass populations boomed after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began to advise and assist farmers in constructing and stocking farm ponds with largemouth bass, even offering advice on managing various fish species.  Soon, those who had stocked largemouth bass on their farm ponds began to pursue them on a burgeoning number of new reservoirs and impoundments built in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.  These impoundments coincided with a postwar fishing boom, additional funds from sales of fishing licenses for the first large-scale attempts at bass fisheries management.  This was especially true in the southern United States, where the largemouth bass thrived in waters too warm or turbid for other types of gamefish.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n\nWith increased industrialization and development, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were dammed, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native [[brook trout]].  Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/>  Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range.  Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and industrial and agricultural pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers in order to form lakes or reservoirs.  In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.<ref name=\"WAT\"/><ref name=\"Ryan, Will 1996\" />\n\n==Rise of modern bass fishing==\n[[Image:Largemothbassbaby.JPG|right|thumb|Example of a very young specimen of ''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in [[Minnesota]]]]\nBy the early 20th century, bass fishing had been well established as a sport with its own following.  Though the use of artificial lures for bass had begun with the [[artificial fly]] and [[fly fishing]] tackle, the bait casting rod and reel soon came to dominate the sport.  Although fixed-spool reels were introduced in use in the United States as early as the 1870s,<ref name=\"HEN\"/> [[fishing reel|spinning]] reels and [[fishing rod|rods]] did not gain wide acceptance as an angling tool until the 1950s.<ref>playboy.com [http://www.orcaonline.org/reel_history.htm O.R.C.A. Online, Reel History]</ref>  Since that time, most bass anglers have used bait casting or spinning tackle, using either artificial lures or live bait (See [[Fishing rod]], [[Fishing reel]]).<ref name=\"WAT\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the development of specific angling tools for bass significantly increased angler bass catches and helped stimulate the development of the sport.  Some of these innovations include the invention of monofilament nylon fishing lines, the [[fiberglass]] (later [[graphite]] composite) fishing rod, the electric trolling motor, the fish finder/depth locator, and new artificial lures and baits made of various plastics. Recently, advanced electronics that mimic the sounds of schooling [[bait fish]] have been introduced, and a controversy has arisen over the proper use of these devices in bass tournament fishing.\n\nSince the early 1990s, [[fly fishing]] for bass, particularly smallmouth bass, has again become popular, using fly patterns, [[fishing rod|rods]], and [[fly fishing|fly lines]] suited for bass.<ref>Murray, Harry, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&product_code=1%2D55821%2D534%2D4&category_code= Fly Fishing for Smallmouth Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 1989</ref><ref>Kreh, Lefty, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&product_code=1%2D59228%2D310%2D1&category_code= Fly Fishing for Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 2004</ref> The Largemouth Bass is the most common sport fish in America.

Outside North America, [[Japan]] and [[South Africa]] have active programs.\nBass fishing as a sport was helped along by the chase for the standing world record which has held for over 75 years. Though surrounded by controversy it is widely accepted that in 1932 a 22-pound 4 ounce bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake, Georgia. It is one of the longest standing records in the sport of fishing. This record was tied on July 2, 2009 when Aichi Japan resident Manabu Kurita caught a 22-pound 4 ounce largemouth bass in [[Lake Biwa]].<ref>International Game and Fish Association [http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&cn=Bass,%20largemouth Largemouth Bass All-Tackle World Record]</ref>\n\n==Population management==\n[[Image:Bassboat1.jpg|thumb|Typical aluminium bass boat with gas motor and electric trolling motor]]\n[[Image:Bassboat2.jpg|thumb|Center console aluminum bass boat]]\nThe increasing popularity of the sport combined with \"catch and release\" practices have in some cases led to an [[overpopulation]] of bass.\n\nAn overpopulated, stunted bass population can best be detected in the spring when all the bass are at least one year old. If virtually all the bass are 4&nbsp;inches long or smaller, the population is probably stunted. Some indicators that a bass population is overpopulated:\n\n# The largemouth bass caught are all less than 1 pound and are \"skinny\".\n# The bluegills are 1/2 pound and larger (too large for the bass to eat).\n\nAn overpopulation and/or stunting of bass may be caused by several factors including:\n\n# Not enough bass being harvested.\n# Too few bluegill or redear sunfish were stocked initially or they are failing to reproduce and the bass population does not have an adequate food supply.\n\nIt is posited that the easiest way to control an overpopulation of largemouth bass is by increasing the take of bass. This is clearly an effective method of thinning the bass population providing recreation at the same time. It may take two to three years to bring the population back into balance. If [[forage fish]] are scarce, stock adult bluegill or redear sunfish (7 to 8&nbsp;inches long). These fish will be too large to be eaten by the bass. The large panfish will spawn in the spring and produce a supply\nof forage.

The trail brought over professionals like [[Michael Iaconelli]], [[Kevin VanDam]], Aaron Martens, [[Cliff Pace]] and [[Luke Clausen]].<ref name=\"wired2fish.com\"/>\n*The ''Bassmaster Tournament Trail'' is organized by the [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS) and was started by [[Ray Scott (angler)|Ray Scott]], the \"father\" of competitive bass fishing. There are a handful of events in which anglers compete for prizing over $100,000 and a chance to make [[Bassmaster Classic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/2019-tournament-schedule|title=2019 Tournament Schedule|date=2018-07-09|website=Bassmaster|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n* The ''Walmart FLW Tour'' was named after [[Forrest L.

Both tours are nationally televised on networks like [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports Net]], and covered extensively by [[news media]].\n* American Bass Anglers (ABA), formerly the Military Bass Anglers Association,  award National championship tournament winners with a Triton Bass boat and Championship ring amongst other prizes.  Thomas Wayne Jones, Sr., from Springfield Tennessee won the 2007 ABA National championship.\n* On the West Coast, WON BASS has been the main regional circuit in operation since the 1980s. Annually, WON BASS conducts the ''U.S. Open of Bass Fishing'' at [[Lake Mead, Nevada]], which pays back nearly $500,000 per event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wonbass.com/|website=WON BASS|title=WON BASS Tournaments|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}</ref> This is a test of both angling skill and endurance as the anglers compete for 3 days in the scorching hot sun and windy conditions of the [[Mojave Desert]]. Renowned anglers Rick Clunn, Byron Velvick, Aaron Martens, and Gary Klein have all been crowned champions during the Open's 25-year history.\n\n==== High school ====\n\nThe state of Illinois was the first to make competitive bass fishing a state-sanctioned high school sport in 2009. They offer 22 sectional tournaments which cater to 250 high school teams across the state. Teams which qualify at the sectional level compete for the state title in May.\n\nStates across the country have taken to Illinois' lead. Kentucky was the second to follow suit in 2012. Private groups have seen the opportunity to grow the industry as well through exposure of high school student to tournament bass fishing. The Bass Federation, for example, offers high school tournament series in over 40 states, eventually crowning a State Champion and giving them the opportunity to compete on the national level.\n\n==== Collegiate ====\n{{See also|Intercollegiate sports team champions#Fishing}}\n\nCompetitive collegiate bass fishing circuits in the United States include FLW College Fishing, the Bassmaster College Series, and Cabela's Collegiate Bass Fishing Series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schonbrun|first1=Zach|title=Collegiate Fishing's Added Lure: Cash on the Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/sports/a-paycheck-for-college-athletes-join-the-fishing-team.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 18, 2014|pages=A1 ff}}</ref>\n\nThe FLW College Series includes three regional qualifiers in each of the five regions of the United States denoted by FLW. The top fifteen finishing teams in each of these regional qualifiers advance to the Regional Invitational tournament and have an opportunity to advance to the FLW College National Championship and fish for a place in the following year's Forrest L Woods Cup Professional Bass Tournament.\n\nSimilarly, the Bassmaster College Series divides the nation into 5 regions. They only offer one qualifying opportunity at the regional level as opposed to the three offered by the FLW College Series. The top 15 from each of the 5 regional qualifiers advance directly to the Bassmaster College Series National Champion and compete for a position in the following year's Bassmaster Classic.\n\nThe Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series is compiled of numerous tournaments accredited by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. The tournaments range in size from 20-30 boats all the way up to 100+ boats. The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series compiles a ranking of \"School of the Year\" points, which are often coveted by schools across the country. These points are gathered through successful tournament finishes in tournaments recognized by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series also hosts a large-scale national open. This is not the only one of its kind, as BoatUS also hosts a similar \"National Championship.\" Unlike the Bassmaster College Series and FLW College Series National Championships, these require no qualification from regional tournaments, and can be entered simply by signing up and paying the entry fee.\n\nIndiana University was the first to establish a tournament fishing club in 1989, with Purdue University creating one soon afterwards. The University of Illinois was third to make a tournament bass fishing student organization, and the trend has grown tremendously ever since.\n\n=== Other countries ===\n\nCompetitive bass fishing has also spread to anglers in other countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. Takahiro Omori, a Japanese angler living in Texas, won the 2004 Bassmaster Classic title. Australian tournaments are based on a native freshwater fish called [[Australian bass]] that is unrelated to largemouth bass.\n\n== Professional Bass Angling ==\nWith the rise in popularity of competitive bass fishing came the multibillion-dollar industry of professional bass angling.  The rise in popularity and the companies that have supported the sport have now made it possible to turn bass angling into a professional sport.  A professional bass angler is a person who competes in bass fishing pro circuit and may also have company sponsorships.  Some famous pro circuits include [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS), [[FLW Outdoors|Walmart FLW Tour]], and the [[Major League Fishing]] (MLF) Bass Pro Tour (BPT) .<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/how-to-become-pro-bass-angler/|title=How to Become a Pro Bass Angler|last=Samsel|first=Jeff|date=Feb 28, 2012|website=Game and Fish Mag|publisher=n.p.|access-date=April 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427004559/http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/how-to-become-pro-bass-angler/|archive-date=2016-04-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Events-Major League Fishing https://majorleaguefishing.com/events/bass-pro-tour/</ref>\n\nProfessional bass anglers are not able to simply sign up for these professional circuits.

He received his MD in 1936 and continued to teach at Budapest, becoming Associate Professor in 1942. During the Second World War (karpaszom\u00e1nyos) he was a physician, airman, and a prisoner of war. He returned in 1946. He then attended P\u00e9cs University Medical School, where he was later Head of the Anatomy Department. After the war, he resumed study of the vestibular system and dealt with the topic of [[neuroendocrinology]]. During his study at P\u00e9cs, he pursued innovative work in the field of [[neuroanatomy]]. In 1948 he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1961, he started the department of electron microscopy in brain research in Hungary.\n\nIn 1963, he returned to Budapest to lead the [[Semmelweis University]] School of Medicine Department of Anatomy. There he mainly addressed the cerebellum and functioning of the cerebral cortex. In addition, he performed experimental research on the spinal cord and brainstem reflex mechanisms. In 1967 he was elected a full member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He headed the department until 1977, and in 1986 officially retired from teaching. Ferenc Kiss, famous for his work produced for the human anatomy atlas, drew his textbook, which was translated into thirteen languages and more than a hundred editions. He proclaimed that half the age of most of the people speaking the development of one and a half years of age, and it will need to communicate is the most important factor.\n\n==Public career==\nIn 1956 at P\u00e9cs, he was chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Intellectuals. He did not return to public life until 1973, when he was elected vice-president of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Four years later he became its president and therefore left the position of University department head. In 1985, he entered parliament as a member of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic. He was (later a member of its abolition), involved in the work of the Hungarian Democratic Forum during the transition. She was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

He received his MD in 1936 and continued to teach at Budapest, becoming Associate Professor in 1942. During the Second World War (karpaszom\u00e1nyos) he was a physician, airman, and a prisoner of war. He returned in 1946. He then attended P\u00e9cs University Medical School, where he was later Head of the Anatomy Department. After the war, he resumed study of the vestibular system and dealt with the topic of [[neuroendocrinology]]. During his study at P\u00e9cs, he pursued innovative work in the field of [[neuroanatomy]]. In 1948 he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1961, he started the department of electron microscopy in brain research in Hungary.\n\nIn 1963, he returned to Budapest to lead the [[Semmelweis University]] School of Medicine Department of Anatomy. There he mainly addressed the cerebellum and functioning of the cerebral cortex. In addition, he performed experimental research on the spinal cord and brainstem reflex mechanisms. In 1967 he was elected a full member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He headed the department until 1977, and in 1986 officially retired from teaching. Ferenc Kiss, famous for his work produced for the human anatomy atlas, drew his textbook, which was translated into thirteen languages and more than a hundred editions. He proclaimed that half the age of most of the people speaking the development of one and a half years of age, and it will need to communicate is the most important factor.\n\n==Public career==\nIn 1956 at P\u00e9cs, he was chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Intellectuals. He did not return to public life until 1973, when he was elected vice-president of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Four years later he became its president and therefor left the position of University department head. In 1985, he entered parliament as a member of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic. He was (later a member of its abolition), involved in the work of the Hungarian Democratic Forum during the transition. She was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

It is affiliated with the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] and with the [[United Church of Christ]].\n\nThe church sanctuary, its [[campanile]] tower and the attached Judson Hall were designated landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1966, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nBy the mid-19th century, the village had the largest [[African-American]] community in the city, along with joined German, French and Irish immigrants, and to the immediate south a majority of Italian immigrants. Earlier more affluent communities had begun an exodus from the adjacent neighborhoods to the south and east. Judson observed that the \"tendency is for the intelligent, well-to-do and church-going people to withdraw from this part of the city\".<ref name=kingdom>{{cite periodical |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2QPAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA21-PA12 |title=The Institutional Church Defined |work=The Kingdom |date=1903 |page=12 |editor-first=Henry A. |editor-last=Fisk |editor2-first=Mary Stuart |editor2-last=Turner |location=San Francisco |volume=VIII |issue=10 |oclc=235774739}}</ref> The park and the new church stood at the intersection between the affluence of [[Fifth Avenue]] and the poverty of [[Lower Manhattan]].\n\nThe church was founded by [[Edward Judson]] who had been preaching at the Berean Baptist Church on Downing Street, also in the village, but his efforts at expanding the congregation were so successful that a new sanctuary was required.<ref name=fromatoz>{{cite fromatoz}} p. 119.</ref>  In 1888, with the backing of [[John D. Rockefeller]] and other prominent [[Baptists]], construction of a new church south of the park was begun.  Judson had chosen the location because he wanted to reach out to the neighboring communities.  It was to be a memorial to Judson's father, [[Adoniram Judson]], one of the first [[Protestant]] missionaries to [[Burma]]. The church building was designed by architect [[Stanford White]], with [[stained glass|stained-glass]] windows by [[John La Farge]].  It features [[Renaissance]] influences wedded to a basic [[Italianate architecture|Italianate form]]. Sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] designed a [[marble]] [[frieze]] in the [[baptistery]], which was carried out by [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]];<ref name=aia4/> it was completed in 1893.<ref name=aia4>{{cite AIA4}}, p. 122.</ref>\n\nAs well as worship and religious education, the church offered health-care and outreach ministries to non-members as well as members.  However, the church was not able to attract sufficient support from its wealthy neighbors on the north side of square, and by 1912, the church found itself in financial difficulties.  The Baptist City Society (metropolitan association of Baptist churches) was persuaded to take over the property and financial responsibility, which it ended up holding until the congregation was again able to resume ownership and control in 1973.\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1921, under the leadership of its pastor, A. Ray Petty, the church offered first its basement and then rented its parish house on Thompson Street to [[Eleanor Campbell (physician)|Dr. Eleanor A. Campbell]], a pioneering female physician who ran the [[Judson Health Center]], a free medical and dental clinic.  The center operated at 237 Thompson Street from 1922 to 1950, when the clinic moved to its present location on [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[SoHo]], the neighborhood to the south. During the 1920s, the church, with aid from the national American Baptist denomination, also ran the Judson Neighborhood House, a settlement house, at 179 Sullivan Street.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] in the early 20th century, Laurence Hosie served as pastor.  Although the congregation dwindled, the church remained active in various social causes, including allowing homeless men to sleep on the pews at times.  In 1937, the Baptist City Society appointed Renato Giacomelli Alden as pastor.\n  \nAfter [[World War II]], with the rush of new students the former parish house and health center was turned into a residence for international students and students of various races, led by Dean R. Wright, the Baptist [[chaplain]] to [[New York University]], the church's neighbor.  At the same time, a new pastor, [[Robert Spike]], began theological explorations with veterans and the artists then working in the village, which brought a new group of congregants and led to a change in the church's worship style to a more modern sensibility.\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn 1956, Howard Moody became the senior minister, continuing the church's outspoken advocacy on issues of civil rights and free expression, as well as breaking with the confessedly evangelical understandings of the past by speaking out for issues once universally considered to be immoral by Christians (such as abortion and the decriminalization of prostitution), a policy that continues under the present leadership of the congregation.  [[Al Carmines]], the associate pastor 1962 to 1979, focused his ministry on the arts ''(see below)''.  The congregation expanded during this period, allowing the church to take back control of its property from the citywide Baptist organization that had been acting as trustee until 1973. Following Moody's retirement in 1990, Peter Laarman became senior pastor.  Coming from a background in union organizing, Laarman led the church into ministries dealing with economic issues, while continuing work with the arts and other social issues, and starting a multi-year program of restoration and renovation of the church's aging buildings.\n\nSince becoming senior minister in 2005, senior pastor Donna Schaper has created a pioneering program to train future clergy in how to do \"public ministry\" from a congregational base, by providing part-time apprenticeships to seminarians and recent graduates.  Also under her leadership, the church has taken a leadership role in the [[New Sanctuary Movement]] for immigrant rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.judson.org/donnaschaper_1 |title=Senior Minister Donna Schaper |accessdate=December 15, 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004050851/http://judson.org/donnaschaper_1 |archivedate=October 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mission==\n{{Baptist}}\nThe church's mission has long been self-described as being devoted to social outreach, and establishing programs designed to help those perceived to be in need, despite the controversial or sometimes, unpopular, nature of that help.\n\nIn the 1950s, the church was the first institution in the village to create a counseling program for [[drug addicts]]; in the 1960s, it led in helping to found the [[Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion]], a nationwide network of Protestant and Jewish clergy who aided women who needed [[abortion]]s before abortion became legal.  In the 1970s, the church operated a residence for runaway teens and established a [[Professional Women's Clinic]] for women engaged in [[prostitution]]; in the 1980s, it helped provide medical resources for people with [[AIDS]].\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the church's clergy operated a relief fund for the families of restaurant workers who were killed during the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] of New York City's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].  Now, the church is active in the New Sanctuary Movement for immigrant rights.\n\n===Early community outreach===\nVerne E. Henderson joined the Judson staff in 1952 as its first Director of Community Service.  A program for youth of the village&nbsp;\u2013 started originally by the [[Police Athletic League of New York City]]&nbsp;\u2013 blossomed under Henderson's leadership with more than two hundred youth attending one or more weekly events.  Many youth were hard-core delinquents and drug users.  Henderson appeared in courts on behalf of those facing legal action and began summer youth programs in upstate New York and [[Vermont]].  Henderson also inaugurated programs for local artists, remodeling the sanctuary for art shows and refurbishing abandoned offices as living quarters for resident artists.  Henderson once invited [[Martha Graham]] to use the sanctuary for dress rehearsals, which eventually led to formation of the [[Judson Dance Theatre]].\n\n==Sponsorship of the arts==\nBeginning in the 1950s, the church supported a radical arts ministry, first led by associate pastor Bernard Scott and subsequently by associate pastor [[Al Carmines]]. The church made space available to artists for art exhibitions, rehearsals, and performances. The church also assured that this space was to be a place where these artists could have the freedom to experiment in their work without fear of [[censorship]]. In 1957, the church offered gallery space to [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], who were then unknown artists. In 1959, the [[Judson Gallery]] showed work by [[pop art]]ists, [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], and [[Red Grooms]]. [[Yoko Ono]] also had her work exhibited at the gallery.\n\nThe [[Judson Dance Theater]], which began in 1962, provided a venue for dancers and choreographers including [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] to create and show their work. Among others, these dancers and choreographers shaped dance history by creating [[postmodern dance]], the first [[avant-garde]] movement in dance theater since the [[modern dance]] of the 1930s and 1940s.  For the past several decades, [[Movement Research]] has presented concerts of experimental dance at the church on Monday evenings during the academic year.\n\nIn the 1970s, the church hosted various art shows and [[multimedia]] events. Most notable among these multimedia events was the [[People's Flag Show]] in November 1970, a six-day exhibition of painting and sculpture on the theme of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. The exhibit and the accompanying symposium, featuring speeches by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Kate Millet]], attracted widespread attention from the public, the press and the police. During the final days of the exhibit, three of the contributing artists were arrested, both pastors (Moody and Carmines) were issued summons (not followed up), and the [[District Attorney]] closed the exhibit on charges of desecration of the American flag.\n\nThe Judson Poets' Theatre started in November 1961&nbsp;\u2013 with a play by poet [[Joel Oppenheimer]]&nbsp;\u2013 as one of three [[off-off-Broadway]] venues (the others were [[Joe Cino#Caffe Cino|Caffe Cino]] and [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]]).  Experimental plays and musicals by later-famous authors and directors, including Sam Shepherd, Lanford Wilson and Tom O'Horgan, were presented in the church's main Meeting Room.  Starting in the late 1960s, Carmines began writing and producing his own musicals, and later, \"oratorios\" that used large volunteer choruses.  Especially notable were several shows using texts by [[Gertrude Stein]], music by Carmines, with direction by the Judson Poets Theatre director Lawrence Kornfeld.\n\nIn the 1980s, the church sponsored various [[political theater|political-theater]] performances, such as those by the Vermont-based [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]. These performances included ''[[Insurrection Opera]]'' and ''[[Oratorio (theater piece)|Oratario]]'', performed in February and March 1984. In this performance, the Bread and Puppet Theater, under the direction of its founder, [[Peter Schumann]], used opera and the company's now signature oversized puppets to convey an anti-nuclear message.  The church has recently become the home of the West Village Chorale, directed by Michael Conley.  The Chorale's former home was [[Church of St. Luke in the Fields|St. Luke's in the Fields]] on Hudson Street.\n\nThe church celebrated its centennial in 1990 with performances and symposia involving many of the artists who had been involved with the arts ministry in the 1960s and 1970s. It continues both its support of the arts and its social outreach to the community.\n\n==Building==\nThe church building is located at 54\u201357 Washington Square South. In addition to La Farge's stained-glass windows and Saint-Gaudens's marble frieze, it features [[Italian Renaissance]] influences wedded to a basic [[Italianate]] form, and has notable examples of [[scagliola]], a very convincing handcrafted imitation of [[marble]] made of highly polished pigmented [[plaster]]. Overall, the exterior and shape of the building is said to resemble the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], while the entrance is said to be inspired by the Renaissance church San Alessandro, built in [[Lucca]], Italy, in 1480. The fourteen stained glass windows in the church's main sanctuary are the largest collection of major LaFarge windows in any one place in the U.S.\n\nThe campanile tower, located at 51\u201354 Washington Square South to the west of the church itself, was built in 1895\u201396, after the sanctuary had been completed, and was designed by the firm of [[McKim, Mead & White]].<ref name=aia4/> The adjacent Hall, however, predates the church, having been built in 1877, and was designed by [[John G. Prague]].<ref name=aia4/>\n\nIn 1999, facing financial difficulties, the church's board of trustees sold the Judson House, the parish building behind the church, to [[New York University School of Law]], which used the site for its new [[New York University School of Law#Furman Hall|Furman Hall]].  At eleven stories tall, the new building now towers over the church and Washington Square Park beyond, causing considerable controversy in the community at the time of its construction.<ref name=nypap>{{cite interview |url=https://www.nypap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bromm_Hal_20071018.pdf#page=36 |title=Individual Interview: The Reminiscences of Hal&nbsp;Bromm: An Interview by  on October 18, 2007 |date=October 18, 2007 |page=34 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316012202/http://www.nypap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bromm_Hal_20071018.pdf#page=36 |archive-date=March 16, 2017 |interviewer=[[Meryl Branch-McTiernan|Branch-McTiernan, Meryl]] |first=Hal |last=Bromm |subject-link=Hal Bromm |publisher=[[New&nbsp;York Preservation Archive Project]] |format=PDF |access-date=December 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Brozan, Nadine | title = Postings:  On West Third Street Between Sullivan and Thompson Streets; New Academic Building for N.Y.U.

It is affiliated with the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] and with the [[United Church of Christ]].\n\nThe church sanctuary, its [[campanile]] tower and the attached Judson Hall were designated landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1966, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nBy the mid-19th century, the village had the largest [[African-American]] community in the city, along with joined German, French and Irish immigrants, and to the immediate south a majority of Italian immigrants. Earlier more affluent communities had begun an exodus from the adjacent neighborhoods to the south and east. Judson observed that the \"tendency is for the intelligent, well-to-do and church-going people to withdraw from this part of the city\".<ref name=kingdom>{{cite periodical |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2QPAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA21-PA12 |title=The Institutional Church Defined |work=The Kingdom |date=1903 |page=12 |editor-first=Henry A. |editor-last=Fisk |editor2-first=Mary Stuart |editor2-last=Turner |location=San Francisco |volume=VIII |issue=10 |oclc=235774739}}</ref> The park and the new church stood at the intersection between the affluence of [[Fifth Avenue]] and the poverty of [[Lower Manhattan]].\n\nThe church was founded by [[Edward Judson]] who had been preaching at the Berean Baptist Church on Downing Street, also in the village, but his efforts at expanding the congregation were so successful that a new sanctuary was required.<ref name=fromatoz>{{cite fromatoz}} p. 119.</ref>  In 1888, with the backing of [[John D. Rockefeller]] and other prominent [[Baptists]], construction of a new church south of the park was begun.  Judson had chosen the location because he wanted to reach out to the neighboring communities.  It was to be a memorial to Judson's father, [[Adoniram Judson]], one of the first [[Protestant]] missionaries to [[Burma]]. The church building was designed by architect [[Stanford White]], with [[stained glass|stained-glass]] windows by [[John La Farge]].  It features [[Renaissance]] influences wedded to a basic [[Italianate architecture|Italianate form]]. Sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] designed a [[marble]] [[frieze]] in the [[baptistery]], which was carried out by [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]];<ref name=aia4/> it was completed in 1893.<ref name=aia4>{{cite AIA4}}, p. 122.</ref>\n\nAs well as worship and religious education, the church offered health-care and outreach ministries to non-members as well as members.  However, the church was not able to attract sufficient support from its wealthy neighbors on the north side of square, and by 1912, the church found itself in financial difficulties.  The Baptist City Society (metropolitan association of Baptist churches) was persuaded to take over the property and financial responsibility, which it ended up holding until the congregation was again able to resume ownership and control in 1973.\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1921, under the leadership of its pastor, A. Ray Petty, the church offered first its basement and then rented its parish house on Thompson Street to [[Eleanor Campbell (physician)|Dr. Eleanor A. Campbell]], a pioneering female physician who ran the [[Judson Health Center]], a free medical and dental clinic.  The center operated at 237 Thompson Street from 1922 to 1950, when the clinic moved to its present location on [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[SoHo]], the neighborhood to the south. During the 1920s, the church, with aid from the national American Baptist denomination, also ran the Judson Neighborhood House, a settlement house, at 179 Sullivan Street.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] in the early 20th century, Laurence Hosie served as pastor.  Although the congregation dwindled, the church remained active in various social causes, including allowing homeless men to sleep on the pews at times.  In 1937, the Baptist City Society appointed Renato Giacomelli Alden as pastor.\n  \nAfter [[World War II]], with the rush of new students the former parish house and health center was turned into a residence for international students and students of various races, led by Dean R. Wright, the Baptist [[chaplain]] to [[New York University]], the church's neighbor.  At the same time, a new pastor, [[Robert Spike]], began theological explorations with veterans and the artists then working in the village, which brought a new group of congregants and led to a change in the church's worship style to a more modern sensibility.\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn 1956, Howard Moody became the senior minister, continuing the church's outspoken advocacy on issues of civil rights and free expression, as well as breaking with the confessedly evangelical understandings of the past by speaking out for issues once universally considered to be immoral by Christians (such as abortion and the decriminalization of prostitution), a policy that continues under the present leadership of the congregation.  [[Al Carmines]], the associate pastor 1962 to 1979, focused his ministry on the arts ''(see below)''.  The congregation expanded during this period, allowing the church to take back control of its property from the citywide Baptist organization that had been acting as trustee until 1973. Following Moody's retirement in 1990, Peter Laarman became senior pastor.  Coming from a background in union organizing, Laarman led the church into ministries dealing with economic issues, while continuing work with the arts and other social issues, and starting a multi-year program of restoration and renovation of the church's aging buildings.\n\nSince becoming senior minister in 2005, senior pastor Donna Schaper has created a pioneering program to train future clergy in how to do \"public ministry\" from a congregational base, by providing part-time apprenticeships to seminarians and recent graduates.  Also under her leadership, the church has taken a leadership role in the [[New Sanctuary Movement]] for immigrant rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.judson.org/donnaschaper_1 |title=Senior Minister Donna Schaper |accessdate=December 15, 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004050851/http://judson.org/donnaschaper_1 |archivedate=October 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mission==\n{{Baptist}}\nThe church's mission has long been self-described as being devoted to social outreach, and establishing programs designed to help those perceived to be in need, despite the controversial or sometimes, unpopular, nature of that help.\n\nIn the 1950s, the church was the first institution in the village to create a counseling program for [[drug addicts]]; in the 1960s, it led in helping to found the [[Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion]], a nationwide network of Protestant and Jewish clergy who aided women who needed [[abortion]]s before abortion became legal.  In the 1970s, the church operated a residence for runaway teens and established a [[Professional Women's Clinic]] for women engaged in [[prostitution]]; in the 1980s, it helped provide medical resources for people with [[AIDS]].\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the church's clergy operated a relief fund for the families of restaurant workers who were killed during the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] of New York City's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].  Now, the church is active in the New Sanctuary Movement for immigrant rights.\n\n===Early community outreach===\nVerne E. Henderson joined the Judson staff in 1952 as its first Director of Community Service.  A program for youth of the village&nbsp;\u2013 started originally by the [[Police Athletic League of New York City]]&nbsp;\u2013 blossomed under Henderson's leadership with more than two hundred youth attending one or more weekly events.  Many youth were hard-core delinquents and drug users.  Henderson appeared in courts on behalf of those facing legal action and began summer youth programs in upstate New York and [[Vermont]].  Henderson also inaugurated programs for local artists, remodeling the sanctuary for art shows and refurbishing abandoned offices as living quarters for resident artists.  Henderson once invited [[Martha Graham]] to use the sanctuary for dress rehearsals, which eventually led to formation of the [[Judson Dance Theatre]].\n\n==Sponsorship of the arts==\nBeginning in the 1950s, the church supported a radical arts ministry, first led by associate pastor Bernard Scott and subsequently by associate pastor [[Al Carmines]]. The church made space available to artists for art exhibitions, rehearsals, and performances. The church also assured that this space was to be a place where these artists could have the freedom to experiment in their work without fear of [[censorship]]. In 1957, the church offered gallery space to [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], who were then unknown artists. In 1959, the [[Judson Gallery]] showed work by [[pop art]]ists, [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], and [[Red Grooms]]. [[Yoko Ono]] also had her work exhibited at the gallery.\n\nThe [[Judson Dance Theater]], which began in 1962, provided a venue for dancers and choreographers including [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] to create and show their work. Among others, these dancers and choreographers shaped dance history by creating [[postmodern dance]], the first [[avant-garde]] movement in dance theater since the [[modern dance]] of the 1930s and 1940s.  For the past several decades, [[Movement Research]] has presented concerts of experimental dance at the church on Monday evenings during the academic year.\n\nIn the 1970s, the church hosted various art shows and [[multimedia]] events. Most notable among these multimedia events was the [[People's Flag Show]] in November 1970, a six-day exhibition of painting and sculpture on the theme of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. The exhibit and the accompanying symposium, featuring speeches by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Kate Millet]], attracted widespread attention from the public, the press and the police.
