He was one of the key figures behind Soviet space program. Among scientific circles of USSR Keldysh was known with epithet \"the Chief Theoretician\"<ref>[[Boris Chertok]], Rockets and people [http://militera.lib.ru/explo/chertok_be/index.html Online version]</ref> in analogy with epithet \"the Chief Designer\" used for [[Sergey Korolyov]].\n\n==Family==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nKeldysh was born to a professional family of [[Russian nobility]]. His grandfather, Mikhail Fomich Keldysh (1839\u20131920), was a military [[physician]], who retired with the military rank of [[General]]. Keldysh's grandmother, Natalia Keldysh (n\u00e9e Brusilova), was a cousin of general [[Aleksei Brusilov]]. Keldysh's maternal grandfather, Alexander Nikolaevich Skvortsov, was a General of Infantry, and fought in the [[Caucasian War]].\n\nKeldysh's father, Vsevolod Mikhailovich Keldysh (1878\u20131965), was a [[civil engineer]], [[Major General]] of the Engineering Service, and a full professor, teaching at the [[Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy]] from 1918. He became a ''Distinguished Engineering Scientist of Soviet Union'' (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420) in 1944. He was one of the authors of contemporary methods for calculating the strength of [[reinforced concrete]], and a designer of the [[Moscow Canal]] and [[Moscow Metro]] projects.\n\nSeveral members of the Keldysh family were victims of political repressions. In the 1930s Keldysh's uncle was sent to a [[labor camp]] on the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]] construction site. In 1935 Keldysh's mother was arrested but was released after a few weeks. It was a part of the campaign of collecting gold from the population, but after Keldysh's father brought all the jewelry the family had, the unsatisfied [[NKVD]] officer returned \"all this garbage\" back.{{clarify|This sentence is completely incoherent|date=June 2018}} Keldysh's brother Mikhail, a historian who specialized in [[Medieval Germany]], was arrested in 1936 and executed in 1937 on suspicion of being a German spy. In 1938 another of Keldysh's brothers, Alexander, was arrested as a French spy. Alexander was spared because of the slight liberalization of the repressions during the transfer of the [[NKVD]] leadership from [[Nikolai Yezhov]] to [[Lavrentiy Beria]], and was acquitted in the court.\n\nThe strongest influence on Keldysh was his older sister, [[Lyudmila Keldysh]] (1904\u20131976), a mathematician and Keldysh's first teacher. Among her children are [[Leonid Keldysh]], director of [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] and [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], a mathematician.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}[[File:Mstislav Keldysh Moscow.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Statue of Mstislav Keldysh in [[Moscow]].]]\nKeldysh was born in 1911 in [[Riga]]. When he was four the family evacuated to [[Moscow]] during the [[First World War]]. In the first years of the [[Soviet Union]] he was refused entrance to an Institute of Civil Engineers because of his attachment to a noble family. Later, he managed to enter and graduate from the [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] department of the [[Moscow State University]].  He obtained employment at the [[TsAGI|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute]] (TsAGI) under [[Mikhail Lavrentyev]] and [[Sergey Chaplygin]].\n\nWorking in TsAGI he explained the auto-oscillation effects of [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]] (in-flight auto-induced oscillations and structural deformations), and [[speed wobble|shimmy]] (auto-oscillation in the nose-wheel of aircraft [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]s while on the ground). The effects were responsible for many aircraft catastrophes at the time.\n\nIn 1937 Keldysh became [[Doctor of Science]] with his dissertation entitled ''Complex Variable and Harmonic Functions Representation by Polynomial Series'', and was appointed a [[Professor]] of [[Moscow State University]].  In 1943 he became a Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  He got his first [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1946 for his works on aircraft auto-oscillations.  In 1943 he also became a full member of the Academy and the Director of NII-1 (Research Institute number 1) of the Department of the Aviation Industry. He also headed the Department of Applied Mechanics of the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]. In 1966 the department was named after him to become the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]].\n\nDuring the 1940s Keldysh became the leader of a group of applied mathematicians involved in almost all large scientific projects of the Soviet Union. Keldysh created the ''Calculation Bureau'' that carried most of the mathematical problems related to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The bureau is also credited with design of the first [[History of computer hardware in communist countries|Soviet computers]]. In 1947 he became a member of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].\n\nKeldysh's main efforts were devoted to [[jet propulsion]] and  [[rocket]]s including [[supersonic]] [[Fluid dynamics|gas dynamics]], [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[Mass transfer|mass]] exchange, and heat shielding. 1959 saw successful testing of the Soviet first [[cruise missile]] [[Burya]], which displayed better performance than the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navajo missile]] being designed in USA at the time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1954 Keldysh, [[Sergey Korolyov]] and [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] submitted a letter to the Soviet Government proposing development of an [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth. The letter was rejected, and the group filed exaggerated [[Vechernyaya Moskva|Soviet newspaper article]]s which influenced American authorities to start satellite programs. This in turn began the effort that culminated in the world's first satellite, [[Sputnik]] in October 1957, which marked the beginning of mankind's [[Space Age]].<ref name=Siddi2017>{{cite web |authorlink1=Asif Azam Siddiqi |title=Sputnik remembered: The first race to space (part 1) (page 1) |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3341/1 |website=www.thespacereview.com |publisher=[[The Space Review]] |date=October 2, 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190424223315/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3341/1 |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Harford 1997</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sixty Years Later, Sputnik Declassifications Offer Primer in Fake News |url=https://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham/sputnik-declassifications-offer-primer-fake-news/ |website=Fordham Newsroom |publisher=[[Fordham University]] |date=10 October 2017 |quote=\u201cIn 1954 . . . because they knew a lot of Soviet journalists, they flooded the Soviet media with speculative articles on space flight .. cited a lot in the Washington Post and New York Times.

In recognition of his contribution to the problems of defense Keldysh was awarded the [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] (1956) and the [[Lenin Prize]] (1957). In 1961 he received a second \u041d\u0435\u0433\u043e of Socialist Labor medal for his contribution to [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight into space, the first person to orbit the Earth.\n\nIn 1961 Keldysh was elected President of the Academy of Sciences and kept this position for 14 years. Concomitantly he became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. His last scientific works were devoted to creation of the [[Shuttle Buran]]. In 1962 he was elected a member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].\n\nKeldysh was 67 when he died. He was honoured with a [[state funeral]] and his ashes were buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] on [[Red Square]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nKeldysh was a member of many foreign academies of sciences, including the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] (1961), [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (1962), [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (1962), and [[Romanian Academy of Sciences]] (1965). He was also an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1966), [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] (1966), [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (1970), and [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1968), foreign corresponding member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]] (1966), and [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]] (1966).\n\nKeldysh was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] (1942, 1946), [[Lenin Prize]] (1957), six [[Order of Lenin|Orders of Lenin]], three other orders, numerous medals and four foreign orders.\n\nThe crater [[Keldysh (crater)|Keldysh]] on the [[Moon]], and a research vessel ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'' are named after him.

He was one of the key figures behind Soviet space program. Among scientific circles of USSR Keldysh was known with epithet \"the Chief Theoretician\"<ref>[[Boris Chertok]], Rockets and people [http://militera.lib.ru/explo/chertok_be/index.html Online version]</ref> in analogy with epithet \"the Chief Designer\" used for [[Sergey Korolyov]].\n\n==Family==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nKeldysh was born to a professional family of [[Russian nobility]]. His grandfather, Mikhail Fomich Keldysh (1839\u20131920), was a military [[physician]], who retired with the military rank of [[General]]. Keldysh's grandmother, Natalia Keldysh (n\u00e9e Brusilova), was a cousin of general [[Aleksei Brusilov]]. Keldysh's maternal grandfather, Alexander Nikolaevich Skvortsov, was a General of Infantry, and fought in the [[Caucasian War]].\n\nKeldysh's father, Vsevolod Mikhailovich Keldysh (1878\u20131965), was a [[civil engineer]], [[Major General]] of the Engineering Service, and a full professor, teaching at the [[Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy]] from 1918. He became a ''Distinguished Engineering Scientist of Soviet Union'' (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420) in 1944. He was one of the authors of contemporary methods for calculating the strength of [[reinforced concrete]], and a designer of the [[Moscow Canal]] and [[Moscow Metro]] projects.\n\nSeveral members of the Keldysh family were victims of political repressions. In the 1930s Keldysh's uncle was sent to a [[labor camp]] on the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]] construction site. In 1935 Keldysh's mother was arrested but was released after a few weeks. It was a part of the campaign of collecting gold from the population, but after Keldysh's father brought all the jewelry the family had, the unsatisfied [[NKVD]] officer returned \"all this garbage\" back.{{clarify|This sentence is completely incoherent|date=June 2018}} Keldysh's brother Mikhail, a historian who specialized in [[Medieval Germany]], was arrested in 1936 and executed in 1937 on suspicion of being a German spy. In 1938 another of Keldysh's brothers, Alexander, was arrested as a French spy. Alexander was spared because of the slight liberalization of the repressions during the transfer of the [[NKVD]] leadership from [[Nikolai Yezhov]] to [[Lavrentiy Beria]], and was acquitted in the court.\n\nThe strongest influence on Keldysh was his older sister, [[Lyudmila Keldysh]] (1904\u20131976), a mathematician and Keldysh's first teacher. Among her children are [[Leonid Keldysh]], director of [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] and [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], a mathematician.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}[[File:Mstislav Keldysh Moscow.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Statue of Mstislav Keldysh in [[Moscow]].]]\nKeldysh was born in 1911 in [[Riga]]. When he was four the family evacuated to [[Moscow]] during the [[First World War]]. In the first years of the [[Soviet Union]] he was refused entrance to an Institute of Civil Engineers because of his attachment to a noble family. Later, he managed to enter and graduate from the [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] department of the [[Moscow State University]].  He obtained employment at the [[TsAGI|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute]] (TsAGI) under [[Mikhail Lavrentyev]] and [[Sergey Chaplygin]].\n\nWorking in TsAGI he explained the auto-oscillation effects of [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]] (in-flight auto-induced oscillations and structural deformations), and [[speed wobble|shimmy]] (auto-oscillation in the nose-wheel of aircraft [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]s while on the ground). The effects were responsible for many aircraft catastrophes at the time.\n\nIn 1937 Keldysh became [[Doctor of Science]] with his dissertation entitled ''Complex Variable and Harmonic Functions Representation by Polynomial Series'', and was appointed a [[Professor]] of [[Moscow State University]].  In 1943 he became a Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  He got his first [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1946 for his works on aircraft auto-oscillations.  In 1943 he also became a full member of the Academy and the Director of NII-1 (Research Institute number 1) of the Department of the Aviation Industry. He also headed the Department of Applied Mechanics of the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]. In 1966 the department was named after him to become the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]].\n\nDuring the 1940s Keldysh became the leader of a group of applied mathematicians involved in almost all large scientific projects of the Soviet Union. Keldysh created the ''Calculation Bureau'' that carried most of the mathematical problems related to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The bureau is also credited with design of the first [[History of computer hardware in communist countries|Soviet computers]]. In 1947 he became a member of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].\n\nKeldysh's main efforts were devoted to [[jet propulsion]] and  [[rocket]]s including [[supersonic]] [[Fluid dynamics|gas dynamics]], [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[Mass transfer|mass]] exchange, and heat shielding. 1959 saw successful testing of the Soviet first [[cruise missile]] [[Burya]], which displayed better performance than the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navajo missile]] being designed in USA at the time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1954 Keldysh, [[Sergey Korolyov]] and [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] submitted a letter to the Soviet Government proposing development of an [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth. The letter was rejected, and the group filed exaggerated [[Vechernyaya Moskva|Soviet newspaper article]]s which influenced American authorities to start satellite programs. This in turn began the effort that culminated in the world's first satellite, [[Sputnik]] in October 1957, which marked the beginning of mankind's [[Space Age]].<ref name=Siddi2017>{{cite web |authorlink1=Asif Azam Siddiqi |title=Sputnik remembered: The first race to space (part 1) (page 1) |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3341/1 |website=www.thespacereview.com |publisher=[[The Space Review]] |date=October 2, 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190424223315/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3341/1 |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Harford 1997</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sixty Years Later, Sputnik Declassifications Offer Primer in Fake News |url=https://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham/sputnik-declassifications-offer-primer-fake-news/ |website=Fordham Newsroom |publisher=[[Fordham University]] |date=10 October 2017 |quote=\u201cIn 1954 . . . because they knew a lot of Soviet journalists, they flooded the Soviet media with speculative articles on space flight .. cited a lot in the Washington Post and New York Times.

In recognition of his contribution to the problems of defense Keldysh was awarded the [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] (1956) and the [[Lenin Prize]] (1957). In 1961 he received a second \u041d\u0435\u0433\u043e of Socialist Labor medal for his contribution to [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight into space, the first person to orbit the Earth.\n\nIn 1961 Keldysh was elected President of the Academy of Sciences and kept this position for 14 years. Concomittantly he became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. His last scientific works were devoted to creation of the [[Shuttle Buran]]. In 1962 he was elected a member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].\n\nKeldysh was 67 when he died. He was honoured with a [[state funeral]] and his ashes were buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] on [[Red Square]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nKeldysh was a member of many foreign academies of sciences, including the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] (1961), [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (1962), [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (1962), and [[Romanian Academy of Sciences]] (1965). He was also an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1966), [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] (1966), [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (1970), and [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1968), foreign corresponding member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]] (1966), and [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]] (1966).\n\nKeldysh was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] (1942, 1946), [[Lenin Prize]] (1957), six [[Order of Lenin|Orders of Lenin]], three other orders, numerous medals and four foreign orders.\n\nThe crater [[Keldysh (crater)|Keldysh]] on the [[Moon]], and a research vessel ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'' are named after him. A [[minor planet]], [[2186 Keldysh]] discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer [[Lyudmila Chernykh]], is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Springer Verlag]] | location = New York | url =https://books.google.com/books?q=2186+Keldysh+SQ4 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | page = 178}}</ref>\n\nA street (Akad\u0113mi\u0137a Mstislava Keldi\u0161a iela) has been named after Keldysh in the district of [[P\u013cavnieki]] in his native [[R\u012bga]], [[Latvia]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Keldysh bomber]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mstislav Keldysh}}\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=79963 }}\n*{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.keldysh.ru/ Keldysh Institute for Applied Mathematics]\n*[http://www.keldysh.ru/Eng/MVKeldysh/ M.

In 1957, he refused to comply with a unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1954 case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', and ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to prevent black students from attending [[Little Rock Central High School]]. This event became known as the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nOrval Eugene Faubus was born in the northwest corner of Arkansas near the village of [[Combs, Arkansas|Combs]] to [[Sam Faubus|John Samuel]] and Addie ([[n\u00e9e]] Joslen) Faubus.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Faubus's first political race was in 1936 when he contested a seat in the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]], which he lost. He was urged to challenge the result but declined, which earned him the gratitude of the Democratic Party. As a result, he was elected circuit clerk and recorder of Madison County, a post he held for two terms.<ref name=\"EAHC\">{{cite web| title=Oral Eugene Faubus (1910-1994)| work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas| date=22 September 2011 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=102 |\npublisher=Central Arkansas Library System| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\nWhen the United States entered [[World War II]], Faubus joined the United States Army and served as an intelligence officer with the [[US Third Army|Third Army]] of General [[George Patton]]. He rose to the rank of major and was in combat several times. His book, ''In This Faraway Land'', documents the military period of his life.  He was active in veterans' causes for the remainder of his life. When Faubus returned from the war, he cultivated ties with leaders of Arkansas' Democratic Party, particularly with progressive reform Governor [[Sid McMath]], leader of the post-war \"GI Revolt\" against corruption, under whom he served as director of the state's highway commission. Meanwhile, conservative Francis Cherry defeated McMath's bid for a third term in the 1952 Democratic primary. Cherry became unpopular with voters, and Faubus challenged him in the 1954 primary.\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1954==\nIn the 1954 campaign, Faubus was compelled to defend his attendance at the defunct northwest Arkansas [[Commonwealth College, Arkansas|Commonwealth College]] in [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]], as well as his early political upbringing. Commonwealth College had been formed by leftist academic and social activists, some of whom later were revealed to have had close ties with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States of America]]. Most of those who attended and taught there were idealistic young people who sought an education or, in the case of the faculty, a job which came with room and board.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\">Reed (1997).</ref>\n\n===Democratic primary===\nDuring the runoff, Cherry and his surrogates accused Faubus of having attended a \"communist\" school and implied that his sympathies remained leftist. Faubus at first denied attending, and then admitted enrolling \"for only a few weeks\". Later, it was shown that he had remained at the school for more than a year, earned good grades, and was elected student body president. Faubus led a group of students who testified on behalf of the college's accreditation before the state legislature. Nevertheless, efforts to paint the candidate as a communist sympathizer backfired in a climate of growing resentment against such allegations. Faubus narrowly defeated Cherry to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.  Relations were cool between the two men for years, but when Cherry died in 1965, Faubus put politics aside and was magnanimous in praising his predecessor.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\n===General election===\nIn the 1954 [[general election]] campaign against Little Rock [[Mayor]] [[Pratt C. Remmel]], Faubus secured the endorsement of the previous 1950 and 1952 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial nominee, [[Jefferson W. Speck]], a planter from [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi County]] in eastern Arkansas.<ref name=\"down\">{{cite book| title=Down from the Hills| author=Orval Faubus| publisher=Pioneer Press| year=1980| page=59}}</ref> Faubus defeated Remmel by a 63% to 37% percent margin. Remmel, a businessman and scion of a prominent Republican family, polled the strongest vote at the time for a GOP candidate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Faubus rejected his father's radicalism for the more mainline [[New Deal]], a pragmatic move. He was elected governor as a liberal Democrat. A moderate on racial issues, his political realism resurfaced as he adopted racial policies that were palatable to influential white voters in the [[Arkansas Delta|Delta]] region as part of a strategy to affect key social reforms and economic growth in Arkansas.<ref>Reed (2007)</ref>\n\n==Governor of Arkansas (1955-1967)==\nThe 1954 election made Faubus sensitive to attacks from the political right. It has been suggested that this sensitivity contributed to his later stance against integration when he was challenged by segregationist elements within his own party. He was known as a particularly effective one-on-one campaigner and was said to have never turned away anyone who sought to shake his hand, no matter how much time it took.\n\n==Little Rock crisis==\n{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}\n[[Image:Little Rock Nine protest.jpg|thumb|260px|Faubus speaking to a crowd protesting the integration of Little Rock schools]]\nFaubus' name became internationally known during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]] of 1957, when he used the Arkansas National Guard to stop [[African Americans]] from attending Little Rock Central High School as part of federally ordered racial desegregation.\n\nCritics have long charged that Faubus' fight in Little Rock against the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] that separate schools were inherently unequal was politically motivated. The ensuing battle helped to shield him from the political fallout from the tax increase and to diminish Johnson's appeal. Journalist [[Harry Ashmore]] (who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his columns on the subject) portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus. Ashmore said that Faubus used the Guard to keep blacks out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to arouse white voters.\n\nFaubus' decision led to a showdown with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and former Governor [[Sid McMath]]. On September 5, 1957, Eisenhower sent a telegram to Governor Orval E. Faubus in which he wrote \"The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.\" This was a response to Faubus' concerns about being taken into custody and his telephones being wired. Eisenhower did say in his telegram that the Department of Justice was collecting facts as to why there was a failure to comply with the courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Press_release_DDE_telegram_to_Faubus.pdf|title=The President Today Sent the Following Telegram to the Honorable Oral E.

The quoted \"friendly and constructive discussion\" led to the Governor claiming his desire to comply with his duty to the Constitution, personal opinions aside. The Governor did express his hope that the Department of Justice would be patient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Statements_by_DDE_and_Faubus.pdf|title=Press Release of Statement by the President and Governor Faubus|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 14, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Arkansas Governor did stay true to his word and on September 21, 1957 President Eisenhower released a statement which announced that the Governor withdrew his troops, the Little Rock School Board was carrying out desegregation plans, and local law was ready to keep order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_21_Statement_by_President.pdf|title=Press Release; Statement by the President|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 21, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> On September 23, 1957, however, Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann sent a telegram to Dwight Eisenhower stating a mob had formed at Central High School in Little Rock. State Police made efforts to control the mob, but for the safety of the newly enrolled children, they were sent home. The Mayor stressed how this was a planned act and that the principal agitator, Jimmy Karam, was an associate of Governor Faubus. The Mayor further explained how there was no way the Governor could not have been aware of this planned attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_23_Mann_to_DDE.pdf|title=Telegram from Mayor Mann to Eisenhower|last=Mann|first=Woodrow|date=September 23, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In October 1957, Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories which effectively removed them from Faubus' control. Eisenhower then sent elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Arkansas to protect the black students and enforce the Federal court order. The Arkansas National Guard later took over protection duties from the 101st Airborne Division. In retaliation, Faubus shut down Little Rock high schools for the 1958\u20131959 school year. This is often referred to as \"The Lost Year\" in Little Rock.<ref>Freyer (2007)</ref> In a 1985 interview with a Huntsville Arkansas student, Faubus stated that the Crisis was due to an \"Usurpation of power\" by the Federal Government. The State knew forced integration by the Federal Government was going to meet with unfavorable results from the Little Rock public. In his opinion, he was acting in his State's best interest at the time.\n\nThough Faubus later lost general popularity as a result of his stand against desegregation, at the time he was included among the \"Ten Men in the World Most Admired by Americans\", according to [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] for 1958. This dichotomy was later summed up as follows: Faubus was both the \"best loved\" and \"most hated\" of Arkansas politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Faubus-style politics===\nFaubus was elected governor to six two-year terms and hence served for twelve years. He maintained a defiant, populist image, while he shifted toward a less confrontational stance with the federal government, particularly during the administrations of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], with each of whom he remained cordial, and both of whom carried Arkansas.\n\nIn the 1956 general election, Faubus, having already eliminated Jim Johnson, overwhelmed GOP candidate Roy Mitchell, later the GOP state chairman from [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]],  321,797 (80.7%) to 77,215 (19.4%). In 1958, he defeated Republican George W. Johnson of [[Greenwood, Arkansas|Greenwood]] in Sebastian County by drawing 82.5% of the votes.\n\nIn 1960, Faubus defeated [[Attorney General]] [[Bruce Bennett (Arkansas politician)|Bruce Bennett]] in the Democratic gubernatorial primary for and then crushed the Republican choice, [[Henry M. Britt]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] from Hot Springs, to secure reelection. Faubus polled 292,064 votes (69.2%) to Britt's 129,921 (30.8%). In the presidential election contest, however, Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] won Arkansas over the Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]] by less than expected. Britt was later a circuit judge in [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]] from 1967 to 1983.\n\nIn 1962, Faubus broke with the [[White Citizens' Council]]s and other groups, who preferred, but did not officially endorse, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Dale Alford]] in that year's gubernatorial primary.<ref>{{cite book| first=Neil R| last=McMillen | title=The Citizens' Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction 1954\u201364| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-252-06441-8| page=285}}</ref> Faubus cast himself as a moderate, he completely ignored the race issue during the 1962 election campaign, and barely secured a majority over Alford, McMath, and three other candidates. He then handily defeated the Republican Willis Ricketts, a then 37-year-old pharmacist from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] in the general election.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nWhile Faubus was still an outcast from black leaders, he nevertheless won a large percent of the black vote. In 1964, when he defeated the Republican [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] by a 57-43 percent margin, Faubus secured 81 percent of the black vote. He even collected a share of the base Republican vote from the conservative party members who had sided with former Republican state chairman [[William L. Spicer]] of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], an intraparty rival of Rockefeller.\n\n==Presidential election of 1960==\nDuring the 1960 presidential election, at a secret meeting held in a rural lodge near Dayton, Ohio, the [[National States Rights Party]] (NSRP) nominated Orval Faubus for President and retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral [[John G. Crommelin]] of Alabama for Vice President. Faubus, however, did not campaign on this ticket actively, and won only 0.07% of the vote (best in his native Arkansas: 6.76%), losing to the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ticket.\n\n==Later life==\nFaubus chose not to run for re-election to a seventh term in what would likely have been a difficult race in 1966. Former gubernatorial candidate [[James D. Johnson]], by then an elected [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] Justice, narrowly won the Democratic nomination over another justice, the moderate Frank Holt. Johnson was then defeated in the general election by Winthrop Rockefeller, who became the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.  Years later, Johnson himself became a Republican and supported Governor [[Frank D. White]], later a benefactor of Faubus.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nIn [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], Faubus was among five people considered for the vice-presidential slot of third-party presidential candidate [[George Wallace]]. However, in light of the public perception of both as segregationists, Wallace ended up selecting retired General [[Curtis LeMay]]. During the 1969 season, Faubus was hired by new owner Jess Odom to be general manager of his [[Li'l Abner]] theme park in the [[Ozark Mountains]], [[Dogpatch USA]]. According to newspaper articles, Faubus was said to have commented that managing the park was similar to running state government because some of the same tricks applied to both{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.\n\nFaubus sought the governorship again in 1970, 1974, and 1986 but was defeated in the Democratic primaries by [[Dale Bumpers]], [[David Pryor]], and [[Bill Clinton]], respectively, each of whom went on to defeat Republican opponents. In the 1970 race, two other Democratic candidates in the running, [[Joe Purcell]] and [[Hayes McClerkin]], failed to make the runoff, and Bumpers barely edged Purcell for the chance to face Faubus directly. In his last race, 1986, he polled 174,402 votes (33.5 percent) to Clinton's 315,397 (60.6 percent).\n\nFaubus' decline occurred when the Democrats reformed their own party in response to public acceptance of the progressive policies followed by Rockefeller. Thus, a new generation of popular Democratic candidates easily contrasted themselves favorably in voters' minds with Faubus' old-style politics and a more conservative Republican Party which followed Rockefeller's tenure in the state. In 1976, a report surfaced that Arkansas Republican leaders had approached Faubus about running for governor that year against Pryor, but both Faubus and the GOP denied the claim. The GOP instead ran the 40-year-old [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]] [[plumber]] Leon Griffith as its sacrificial lamb candidate against Pryor, who won the second of his two gubernatorial terms with more than 80 percent of the ballots.<ref>''Ripon Forum'', XII (June 15, 1976), p. 2</ref>\n\nFaubus died of [[prostate cancer]] on December 14, 1994, and is interred at the Combs Cemetery in Combs, Arkansas.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| title=Orval Faubus, Segregation's Champion, Dies at 84| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/obituaries/orval-faubus-segregation-s-champion-dies-at-84.html| work=New York Times| author=Peter Applebome| date=15 December 1994| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n'''1954 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nFrancis Cherry (inc.) 47%\nOrval Faubus 34%\nGuy H. \"Mutt\" Jones 13%\nGus McMillan 6%\n\n'''1954 Democratic Primary Runoff for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus 51%\nFrancis Cherry 49%\n\n'''1954 General Election for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (D) 62%\nPratt Remmel (R) 38%\n\n'''1956 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (inc.) 58%\nJames D.

In 1957, he refused to comply with a unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1954 case ''[[Brown v.

He rose to the rank of major and was in combat several times. His book, ''In This Faraway Land'', documents the military period of his life.  He was active in veterans' causes for the remainder of his life.\n\nWhen Faubus returned from the war, he cultivated ties with leaders of Arkansas' Democratic Party, particularly with progressive reform Governor [[Sid McMath]], leader of the post-war \"GI Revolt\" against corruption, under whom he served as director of the state's highway commission. Meanwhile, conservative Francis Cherry defeated McMath's bid for a third term in the 1952 Democratic primary.

Remmel, a businessman and scion of a prominent Republican family, polled the strongest vote at the time for a GOP candidate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Faubus rejected his father's radicalism for the more mainline [[New Deal]], a pragmatic move. He was elected governor as a liberal Democrat. A moderate on racial issues, his political realism resurfaced as he adopted racial policies that were palatable to influential white voters in the [[Arkansas Delta|Delta]] region as part of a strategy to affect key social reforms and economic growth in Arkansas.<ref>Reed (2007)</ref>\n\n==Governor of Arkansas (1955-1967)==\nThe 1954 election made Faubus sensitive to attacks from the political right. It has been suggested that this sensitivity contributed to his later stance against integration when he was challenged by segregationist elements within his own party. He was known as a particularly effective one-on-one campaigner and was said to have never turned away anyone who sought to shake his hand, no matter how much time it took.\n\n==Little Rock crisis==\n{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}\n[[Image:Little Rock Nine protest.jpg|thumb|260px|Faubus speaking to a crowd protesting the integration of Little Rock schools]]\nFaubus' name became internationally known during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]] of 1957, when he used the Arkansas National Guard to stop [[African Americans]] from attending Little Rock Central High School as part of federally ordered racial desegregation.\n\nCritics have long charged that Faubus' fight in Little Rock against the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] that separate schools were inherently unequal was politically motivated. The ensuing battle helped to shield him from the political fallout from the tax increase and to diminish Johnson's appeal. Journalist [[Harry Ashmore]] (who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his columns on the subject) portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus. Ashmore said that Faubus used the Guard to keep blacks out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to arouse white voters.\n\nFaubus' decision led to a showdown with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and former Governor [[Sid McMath]]. On September 5, 1957, Eisenhower sent a telegram to Governor Orval E. Faubus in which he wrote \"The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.\" This was a response to Faubus' concerns about being taken into custody and his telephones being wired. Eisenhower did say in his telegram that the Department of Justice was collecting facts as to why there was a failure to comply with the courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Press_release_DDE_telegram_to_Faubus.pdf|title=The President Today Sent the Following Telegram to the Honorable Oral E.

The quoted \"friendly and constructive discussion\" led to the Governor claiming his desire to comply with his duty to the Constitution, personal opinions aside. The Governor did express his hope that the Department of Justice would be patient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Statements_by_DDE_and_Faubus.pdf|title=Press Release of Statement by the President and Governor Faubus|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 14, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Arkansas Governor did stay true to his word and on September 21, 1957 President Eisenhower released a statement which announced that the Governor withdrew his troops, the Little Rock School Board was carrying out desegregation plans, and local law was ready to keep order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_21_Statement_by_President.pdf|title=Press Release; Statement by the President|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 21, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> On September 23, 1957, however, Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann sent a telegram to Dwight Eisenhower stating a mob had formed at Central High School in Little Rock. State Police made efforts to control the mob, but for the safety of the newly enrolled children, they were sent home. The Mayor stressed how this was a planned act and that the principal agitator, Jimmy Karam, was an associate of Governor Faubus. The Mayor further explained how there was no way the Governor could not have been aware of this planned attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_23_Mann_to_DDE.pdf|title=Telegram from Mayor Mann to Eisenhower|last=Mann|first=Woodrow|date=September 23, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In October 1957, Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories which effectively removed them from Faubus' control. Eisenhower then sent elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Arkansas to protect the black students and enforce the Federal court order. The Arkansas National Guard later took over protection duties from the 101st Airborne Division. In retaliation, Faubus shut down Little Rock high schools for the 1958\u20131959 school year. This is often referred to as \"The Lost Year\" in Little Rock.<ref>Freyer (2007)</ref> In a 1985 interview with a Huntsville Arkansas student, Faubus stated that the Crisis was due to an \"Usurpation of power\" by the Federal Government. The State knew forced integration by the Federal Government was going to meet with unfavorable results from the Little Rock public. In his opinion, he was acting in his State's best interest at the time.\n\nThough Faubus later lost general popularity as a result of his stand against desegregation, at the time he was included among the \"Ten Men in the World Most Admired by Americans\", according to [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] for 1958. This dichotomy was later summed up as follows: Faubus was both the \"best loved\" and \"most hated\" of Arkansas politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Faubus-style politics===\nFaubus was elected governor to six two-year terms and hence served for twelve years. He maintained a defiant, populist image, while he shifted toward a less confrontational stance with the federal government, particularly during the administrations of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], with each of whom he remained cordial, and both of whom carried Arkansas.\n\nIn the 1956 general election, Faubus, having already eliminated Jim Johnson, overwhelmed GOP candidate Roy Mitchell, later the GOP state chairman from [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]],  321,797 (80.7%) to 77,215 (19.4%). In 1958, he defeated Republican George W. Johnson of [[Greenwood, Arkansas|Greenwood]] in Sebastian County by drawing 82.5% of the votes.\n\nIn 1960, Faubus defeated [[Attorney General]] [[Bruce Bennett (Arkansas politician)|Bruce Bennett]] in the Democratic gubernatorial primary for and then crushed the Republican choice, [[Henry M. Britt]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] from Hot Springs, to secure reelection. Faubus polled 292,064 votes (69.2%) to Britt's 129,921 (30.8%). In the presidential election contest, however, Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] won Arkansas over the Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]] by less than expected. Britt was later a circuit judge in [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]] from 1967 to 1983.\n\nIn 1962, Faubus broke with the [[White Citizens' Council]]s and other groups, who preferred, but did not officially endorse, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Dale Alford]] in that year's gubernatorial primary.<ref>{{cite book| first=Neil R| last=McMillen | title=The Citizens' Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction 1954\u201364| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-252-06441-8| page=285}}</ref> Faubus cast himself as a moderate, he completely ignored the race issue during the 1962 election campaign, and barely secured a majority over Alford, McMath, and three other candidates. He then handily defeated the Republican Willis Ricketts, a then 37-year-old pharmacist from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] in the general election.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nWhile Faubus was still an outcast from black leaders, he nevertheless won a large percent of the black vote. In 1964, when he defeated the Republican [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] by a 57-43 percent margin, Faubus secured 81 percent of the black vote. He even collected a share of the base Republican vote from the conservative party members who had sided with former Republican state chairman [[William L. Spicer]] of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], an intraparty rival of Rockefeller.\n\n==Presidential election of 1960==\nDuring the 1960 presidential election, at a secret meeting held in a rural lodge near Dayton, Ohio, the [[National States Rights Party]] (NSRP) nominated Orval Faubus for President and retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral [[John G. Crommelin]] of Alabama for Vice President. Faubus, however, did not campaign on this ticket actively, and won only 0.07% of the vote (best in his native Arkansas: 6.76%), losing to the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ticket.\n\n==Later life==\nFaubus chose not to run for re-election to a seventh term in what would likely have been a difficult race in 1966. Former gubernatorial candidate [[James D. Johnson]], by then an elected [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] Justice, narrowly won the Democratic nomination over another justice, the moderate Frank Holt. Johnson was then defeated in the general election by Winthrop Rockefeller, who became the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.  Years later, Johnson himself became a Republican and supported Governor [[Frank D. White]], later a benefactor of Faubus.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nIn [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], Faubus was among five people considered for the vice-presidential slot of third-party presidential candidate [[George Wallace]]. However, in light of the public perception of both as segregationists, Wallace ended up selecting retired General [[Curtis LeMay]]. During the 1969 season, Faubus was hired by new owner Jess Odom to be general manager of his [[Li'l Abner]] theme park in the [[Ozark Mountains]], [[Dogpatch USA]]. According to newspaper articles, Faubus was said to have commented that managing the park was similar to running state government because some of the same tricks applied to both{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.\n\nFaubus sought the governorship again in 1970, 1974, and 1986 but was defeated in the Democratic primaries by [[Dale Bumpers]], [[David Pryor]], and [[Bill Clinton]], respectively, each of whom went on to defeat Republican opponents. In the 1970 race, two other Democratic candidates in the running, [[Joe Purcell]] and [[Hayes McClerkin]], failed to make the runoff, and Bumpers barely edged Purcell for the chance to face Faubus directly. In his last race, 1986, he polled 174,402 votes (33.5 percent) to Clinton's 315,397 (60.6 percent).\n\nFaubus' decline occurred when the Democrats reformed their own party in response to public acceptance of the progressive policies followed by Rockefeller. Thus, a new generation of popular Democratic candidates easily contrasted themselves favorably in voters' minds with Faubus' old-style politics and a more conservative Republican Party which followed Rockefeller's tenure in the state. In 1976, a report surfaced that Arkansas Republican leaders had approached Faubus about running for governor that year against Pryor, but both Faubus and the GOP denied the claim. The GOP instead ran the 40-year-old [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]] [[plumber]] Leon Griffith as its sacrificial lamb candidate against Pryor, who won the second of his two gubernatorial terms with more than 80 percent of the ballots.<ref>''Ripon Forum'', XII (June 15, 1976), p. 2</ref>\n\nFaubus died of [[prostate cancer]] on December 14, 1994, and is interred at the Combs Cemetery in Combs, Arkansas.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| title=Orval Faubus, Segregation's Champion, Dies at 84| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/obituaries/orval-faubus-segregation-s-champion-dies-at-84.html| work=New York Times| author=Peter Applebome| date=15 December 1994| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n'''1954 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nFrancis Cherry (inc.) 47%\nOrval Faubus 34%\nGuy H. \"Mutt\" Jones 13%\nGus McMillan 6%\n\n'''1954 Democratic Primary Runoff for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus 51%\nFrancis Cherry 49%\n\n'''1954 General Election for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (D) 62%\nPratt Remmel (R) 38%\n\n'''1956 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (inc.) 58%\nJames D.

The exact coordinates of the armory are today unknown, but they are approximately at {{coord|38.9721|-95.2359}} . This armory was probably established in June 1863 to contain the muskets provided by the State of Kansas and all firearms owned by the individual residents of town. The city government had passed an ordinance forbidding anyone from keeping their weapons anywhere but the armory. Peter D. Ridenour, a local businessman, wrote later that the sixty muskets, to be used by the local militia to defend Lawrence, were old and rusty and not much good.<ref>William E. Connelley, ''Quantrill and the Border Wars'' (Cedar Rapids, Iowa: The Torch Press, 1910), pp. 330, 340.</ref><ref>Peter D. Ridenour, ''Quantrill's Raid: Aug. 21, 1863'' (Lawrence, Kans.: Douglas County Historical Society, n.d.), p. 1.</ref>\n\nOn August 21, 1863, [[William C. Quantrill]] and about 400 Confederate guerrillas and regular army recruits raided Lawrence. Quantrill came so fast that none of the town's defenders was able to reach the armory before the guerrillas took control of it. A few persons had kept their guns at home in defiance of the city ordinance, so a bit of scattered resistance occurred. Two camps of recruits also had no arms with them and were mercilessly gunned down. Ironically, of all the business structures on Massachusetts Street only the armory and one other building were left standing. Most of the armory's guns were left in the armory by the guerrillas.<ref>Connelley, pp. 337-40, 376-7, 388.</ref><ref>Richard Cordley, ''The Lawrence Massacre by a Band of Missouri Ruffians Under Quantrell'' (Lawrence, Kans.:  J. S. Broughton, 1865), in the Kansas Collection, at http://www.kancoll.org/books/cordley_massacre/quantrel.raid.html .</ref>\n\nJust two days later the guerrillas were rumored to be heading again toward Lawrence. This time a number of men went to the armory and armed themselves with the guns there. The rumor turned out to be false. In 1864 [[blockhouses]] were built to allow the local militia to defend Lawrence and by that time the use of the armory appeared to have ceased.<ref>Ridenour, pp. 14-5.</ref>\n\n==Lawrence Kansas Army National Guard Armory==\nThe coordinates of this armory are known, as it has existed for years, probably being built in the 1950s. The coordinates are {{coord|38.9798|-95.2599}}. The Lawrence Kansas Army National Guard Armory sits on a triangle of land bound on the north by West 2nd Street, on the west by Iowa Street and along the  east by McDonald Drive.  McDonald Drive runs from the northeast to the southwest of the armory, intersecting both 2nd and Iowa streets. The Kansas Army National Guard owns the entire triangle of land occupied by the armory buildings and parking area. McDonald connects the [[Kansas Turnpike]] from the north to [[U.S. Highway 40 (Kansas)|U.S. Highway 40]] to the south.

The exact coordinates of the armory are today unknown, but they are approximately at {{coord|38.9721|-95.2359}} . This armory was probably established in June 1863 to contain the muskets provided by the State of Kansas and all firearms owned by the individual residents of town. The city government had passed an ordinance forbidding anyone from keeping their weapons anywhere but the armory. Peter D. Ridenour, a local businessman, wrote later that the sixty muskets, to be used by the local militia to defend Lawrence, were old and rusty and not much good.<ref>William E. Connelley, ''Quantrill and the Border Wars'' (Cedar Rapids, Iowa: The Torch Press, 1910), pp. 330, 340.</ref><ref>Peter D. Ridenour, ''Quantrill's Raid: Aug. 21, 1863'' (Lawrence, Kans.: Douglas County Historical Society, n.d.), p. 1.</ref>\n\nOn August 21, 1863, [[William C. Quantrill]] and about 400 Confdederate guerrillas and regular army recruits raided Lawrence. Quantrill came so fast that none of the town's defenders was able to reach the armory before the guerrillas took control of it. A few persons had kept their guns at home in defiance of the city ordinance, so a bit of scattered resistance occurred. Two camps of recruits also had no arms with them and were mercilessly gunned down. Ironically, of all the business structures on Massachusetts Street only the armory and one other building were left standing. Most of the armory's guns were left in the armory by the guerrillas.<ref>Connelley, pp. 337-40, 376-7, 388.</ref><ref>Richard Cordley, ''The Lawrence Massacre by a Band of Missouri Ruffians Under Quantrell'' (Lawrence, Kans.:  J. S. Broughton, 1865), in the Kansas Collection, at http://www.kancoll.org/books/cordley_massacre/quantrel.raid.html .</ref>\n\nJust two days later the guerrillas were rumored to be heading again toward Lawrence. This time a number of men went to the armory and armed themselves with the guns there. The rumor turned out to be false. In 1864 [[blockhouses]] were built to allow the local militia to defend Lawrence and by that time the use of the armory appeared to have ceased.<ref>Ridenour, pp. 14-5.</ref>\n\n==Lawrence Kansas Army National Guard Armory==\nThe coordinates of this armory are known, as it has existed for years, probably being built in the 1950s. The coordinates are {{coord|38.9798|-95.2599}}. The Lawrence Kansas Army National Guard Armory sits on a triangle of land bound on the north by West 2nd Street, on the west by Iowa Street and along the  east by McDonald Drive.  McDonald Drive runs from the northeast to the southwest of the armory, intersecting both 2nd and Iowa streets. The Kansas Army National Guard owns the entire triangle of land occupied by the armory buildings and parking area. McDonald connects the [[Kansas Turnpike]] from the north to [[U.S. Highway 40 (Kansas)|U.S. Highway 40]] to the south. The armory can be located on satellite imagery.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Kansas]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lawrence, Kansas]]\n[[Category:1863 establishments in Kansas]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Confdederate->Confederate -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_armory_(Lawrence,_Kansas)"}
