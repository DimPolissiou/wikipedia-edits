The former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection. [[Egyptians]] in this era worshiped their Pharaoh as a god, believing that he ensured the annual flooding of the Nile that was necessary for their crops. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles, and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as a specially selected people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/history/herlin/textsup.htm|title=Ancient African Civilizations to ca. 1500: Pharaonic Egypt to Ca. 800 BC|last=Herlin|first=Susan J.|year=2003|page=27|accessdate=23 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823031522/http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/history/herlin/textsup.htm|archivedate=August 23, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Height of the Old Kingdom===\n{{Main|Fourth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Cairo, Gizeh, Sphinx and Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] in front of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Giza]].]]\nThe Old Kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2613\u20132494 BC), which began with [[Sneferu]] (2613\u20132589 BC). After Djoser, Pharaoh Snefru was the next great pyramid builder. Snefru commissioned the building of not one, but three pyramids. The first is called the [[Meidum pyramid]], named for its location in Egypt. Snefru abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid. The Meidum pyramid was the first to have an above-ground burial chamber.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.penfield.edu/webpages/jgiotto/onlinetextbook.cfm?subpage=1525828|title=Ancient Egypt - the Archaic Period and Old Kingdom|website=www.penfield.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Using more stones than any other Pharaoh, he built the three pyramids: a now collapsed pyramid in [[Meidum]], the [[Bent Pyramid]] at [[Dahshur]], and the [[Red Pyramid]], at North Dahshur. However, the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at Saqqara, but during the building of 'The Great Pyramids' at Giza.<ref>Carl Roebuck (1984), ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 57.</ref>\n\nSneferu was succeeded by his son, [[Khufu]] (2589\u20132566 BC), who built the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. After Khufu's death, his sons [[Djedefra]] (2566\u20132558 BC) and [[Khafra]] (2558\u20132532 BC) may have quarrelled. The latter built the second pyramid and (in traditional thinking) the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] in [[Giza]]. Recent re-examination of evidence has led Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev to propose that the Sphinx had been built by [[Djedefra]] as a monument to his father Khufu.<ref>Vassil Dobrev, French Institute, Cairo, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1478998/I-have-solved-riddle-of-the-Sphinx-says-Frenchman.html link 1], [http://documentarystorm.com/riddle-of-the-sphinx/ link 2]</ref> Alternatively, the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafra and Khufu himself.\n\nThere were military expeditions into Canaan and Nubia, with Egyptian influence reaching up the Nile into what is today the Sudan.<ref>p.5, ''The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History'' (4th edition, 1993), Dupuy & Dupuy.</ref> The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were king [[Menkaure]] (2532\u20132504 BC), who built the smallest pyramid in Giza, [[Shepseskaf]] (2504\u20132498 BC) and, perhaps, [[Djedefptah]] (2498\u20132496 BC).\n[[File:Khufu CEM.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Khufu]], the builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza.]]\n\n===Fifth Dynasty===\n{{Main|Fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (2494\u20132345 BC) began with [[Userkaf]] (2494\u20132487 BC) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god [[Ra]]. Consequently, fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the Fourth Dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in [[Abusir]]. Userkaf was succeeded by his son [[Sahure]] (2487\u20132475 BC) who commanded an expedition to [[Kingdom of Punt|Punt]]. Sahure was in turn succeeded by [[Neferirkare Kakai]] (2475\u20132455 BC) who was Sahure's son. Neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary. He was followed by two short-lived kings, his son [[Neferefre]] (2455\u20132453&nbsp;BC) and [[Shepseskare]], the latter of uncertain parentage.<ref>Miroslav Verner: ''Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology'', Archiv Orient\u00e1ln\u00ed, Volume 69: 2001</ref> Shepseskare may have been deposed by Neferefre's brother [[Nyuserre Ini]] (2445\u20132421 BC), a long lived pharaoh who built extensively in Abusir and restarted royal activity in Giza.\n\nThe last Pharaohs of the dynasty were [[Menkauhor Kaiu]] (2421\u20132414 BC), [[Djedkare Isesi]] (2414\u20132375 BC) and  [[Unas]] (2375\u20132345), the earliest ruler to have the [[Pyramid Texts|pyramid texts]] inscribed in his pyramid.\n\nEgypt's expanding interests in trade goods such as [[ebony]], incense such as [[myrrh]] and [[frankincense]], gold, copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea. They traded with Lebanon for [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] and travelled the length of the Red Sea to the [[Kingdom of Punt]]\u2014possibly modern day Somalia\u2014for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs ([[treenail]]s) or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.\n\n===Decline into the First Intermediate Period===\n{{Main|Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|First Intermediate Period}}\n\nDuring the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (2345\u20132181 BC) the power of pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful [[nomarch]]s (regional governors). These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the Pharaoh. However, Nile flood control was still the subject of very large works, including especially the canal to [[Lake Moeris]] around 2300 BC, which was likely also the source of water to the [[Giza pyramid complex]] centuries earlier.\n\nInternal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of [[Pepi II]] (2278\u20132184 BC) towards the end of the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles.  The country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\n\nThe final blow was the [[22nd century BC drought]] in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation. For at least some years between 2200 and 2150 BC, this prevented the normal flooding of the [[Nile]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jean-Daniel Stanley|year=2003 |title=Nile flow failure at the end of the Old Kingdom, Egypt: Strontium isotopic and petrologic evidence |journal=[[Geoarchaeology (journal)|Geoarchaeology]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=395\u2013402 |doi=10.1002/gea.10065 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhatever its cause, the collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife. An important inscription on the tomb of [[Ankhtifi]], a [[nomarch]] during the early [[First Intermediate Period]], describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land.\n\n==Art==\nThe most defining feature of [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian art]] is its function, as that was the entire purpose of creation. Art was not made for enjoyment in the strictest sense, but rather served a role of some kind in Egyptian religion and ideology.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=The Art of Ancient Egypt |last=Robins |first=Gay |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2008 |location=Cambridge}}</ref> This fact manifests itself in the artistic style, even as it evolved over the dynasties. The three primary principles of that style, frontality, composite composition, and hierarchy scale, illustrates this quite well.<ref name=\":2\" /> These characteristics, initiated in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]]<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |title=A Companion to Ancient Egypt |volume=I |last=Sourouzian |first=Hourig |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |year=2010 |pages=853\u2013881}}</ref> and solidified during the Old Kingdom, persisted with some adaptability throughout the entirety of ancient Egyptian history as the foundation of its art.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |title=When the Pyramids Were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom |last=Arnold|first=Dorothea |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Rizzoli International Publications Inc. |year=1999 |pages=7\u201317}}</ref>\n[[File:False door from the tomb of Metjetji MET DT259192.jpg|thumb|left|False Door from the Tomb of Metjetji. ca. 2353-2323&nbsp;BC, Dynasty&nbsp;5-6, Old Kingdom. Tomb of Metjetji at Saqqara.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/543907 |title=The Metropolitan Museum}}</ref>]]\nFrontality, the first principle, indicates that art was viewed directly from the front. One was meant to approach a piece as they would a living individual, for it was meant to be a place of manifestation. The act of interaction would bring forth the divine entity represented in the art.<ref name=\":2\"/> It was therefore imperative that whomever was represented be as identifiable as possible. The guide lines developed in the Old Kingdom and the later grid system developed in the Middle Kingdom ensured that art was axial, symmetrical, proportional, and most importantly reproducible and therefore recognizable.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book |title=Proportion and Style in Ancient Egyptian Art |last=Robins |first=Gay |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1994}}</ref> Composite composition, the second principle, also contributes to the goal of identification. Multiple perspective were used in order to ensure that the onlooker could determine precisely what they saw.<ref name=\":2\"/> Though Egyptian art almost always includes descriptive text, literacy rates were not high, so the art gave another method for communicating the same information. One of the best examples of composite composition is the human form. In most two-dimensional relief, the head, legs, and feet are seen in profile, while the torso faces directly front. Another common example is an aerial view of a building or location.<ref name=\":2\"/> The third principle, hierarchy of scale, illustrates relative importance in society. The larger the figure, the more important the individual. The king is usually the largest, aside from deities. Similarity in size equated similarity in position. However, this is not to say that physical differences weren't shown as well. Women, for example, are usually shown as smaller than men. Children retain adult features and proportions, but are substantially smaller in size.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nAside from the three primary conventions, there are several characteristics that can help date a piece to a particular time frame. Proportions of the human figure are one of the most distinctive, as they vary between kingdoms.<ref name=\":3\"/> Old Kingdom male figures have characteristically broad shoulders and a long torso, with obvious musculature. On the other hand, females are narrower in the shoulders and waist, with longer legs and a shorter torso.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, in the Sixth Dynasty, the male figures lose their muscularity and their shoulders narrow. Eye also tend to get much larger.<ref name=\":2\"/> In order to help maintain the consistency of these proportions, the Egyptians used a series of eight guidelines to divide the body. They occurred at the following locations: the top of the head, the hairline, the base of the neck, the underarms, the tip of the elbow or the bottom of the ribcage, the top of the thigh at the bottom of the buttocks, the knee, and the middle of the lower leg.<ref name=\":3\"/> From the soles of the feet to the hairline was also divided into thirds, one-third between the soles and the knee, another third between the knee and the elbow, and the final third from the elbow to the hairline. The broad shoulders that appeared in the Fifth Dynasty constituted roughly that one-third length as well.<ref name=\":3\"/> These proportions not only help with the identification of representations and the reproduction of art, but also tie into the Egyptian ideal of order, which tied into the solar aspect of their religion and the inundations of the Nile.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nThough the above concepts apply to most, if not all, figures in Egyptian art, there are additional characteristics that applied to the representations of the king. Their appearance was not an exact rendering of the king's visage, though kings are somewhat identifiable through looks alone. Identification could be supplied by inscriptions or context.<ref name=\":2\"/> A huge, more important part of a king's portrayal was about the ideal of the office of kingship,<ref name=\":2\"/> which were dependent on the time period. The Old Kingdom was considered a golden age for Egypt, a grandiose height to which all future kingdoms aspired. As such, the king was portrayed as young vital, with features that agreed with the standards of beauty of the time. The musculature seen in male figures was also applied to kings. A royal rite, the jubilee run which was established during the Old Kingdom, involved the king running around a group of markers that symbolized the geographic borders of Egypt. This was meant to be a demonstration of the king's physical vigor, which determined his capacity to continue his reign.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Egyptian Art |last=Malek |first=Jaromir |publisher=Phaidon Press Limited |year=1999 |location=London}}</ref> This idea of kingly youth and strength were pervasive in the Old Kingdom and thus shown in the art.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n[[File:Menkaura.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Menkaure]] with [[Hathor]] and [[Anput]] from the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo. Demonstrates a group statue of graywacke with Old Kingdom features and proportions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalegyptianmuseum.org/detail.aspx?id=14994 |title=Statue of Menkaure with Hathor and Cynopolis |website=The Global Egyptian Museum}}</ref>]]\nSculpture was a major product of the Old Kingdom. The position of the figures in this period was mostly limited to sitting or standing, either with feet together or in the striding pose. Group statues of the king with either gods or family members, typically his wife and children, were also common.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIt was not just the subject of sculpture that was important, but also the material: The use of hard stone, such as gneiss, graywacke, schist, and granite, was relatively common in the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Lyvia |date=2011 |title=Enlivening the Body: Color and Stone Statues in Old Kingdom Egypt |journal=Notes in the History of Art |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=4\u201311 |doi=10.1086/sou.30.3.23208555}}</ref> The color of the stone had a great deal of symbolism and was chosen deliberately.<ref name=\":2\"/> Four colors were distinguished in the ancient Egyptian language: black, green, red, and white.<ref name=\":6\"/> Black was associated with Egypt due to the color of the soil after the Nile flood, green with vegetation and rebirth, red with the sun and its regenerative cycle, and white with purity.<ref name=\":2\"/> The statue of [[Menkaure]] with [[Hathor]] and [[Anput]] is an example of a typical Old Kingdom sculpture.

While the Old Kingdom was a period of internal security and prosperity, it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the [[First Intermediate Period]].<ref>Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', pp. 55 & 60.</ref> During the Old Kingdom, the [[Lists of rulers of Egypt|king of Egypt]] (not called the [[Pharaoh]] until the New Kingdom) became a [[Divine right of kings|living god]] who ruled absolutely and could demand the services and wealth of his subjects.<ref name=\"Roebuck-56\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 56.</ref>\n\nUnder King [[Djoser]], the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the royal capital of Egypt was moved to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], where [[Djoser]] established his court. A new era of building was initiated at [[Saqqara]] under his reign. King Djoser's architect, [[Imhotep]], is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural form\u2014the [[step pyramid]].<ref name=\"Roebuck-56\" /> The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known for the large number of [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt's kings.\n\n==History==\n\n===Rise of the Old Kingdom===\n{{Main Article|Third Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Saqqara BW 5.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Pyramid of Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]].]]\nThe first King of the Old Kingdom was [[Djoser]] (sometime between 2691 and 2625 BC) of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]], who ordered the construction of a pyramid (the [[Pyramid of Djoser|Step Pyramid]]) in Memphis' necropolis, [[Saqqara]].

The former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection. [[Egyptians]] in this era worshiped their Pharaoh as a god, believing that he ensured the annual flooding of the Nile that was necessary for their crops. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles, and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as a specially selected people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/history/herlin/textsup.htm|title=Ancient African Civilizations to ca. 1500: Pharaonic Egypt to Ca. 800 BC|last=Herlin|first=Susan J.|year=2003|page=27|accessdate=23 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823031522/http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/history/herlin/textsup.htm|archivedate=August 23, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Height of the Old Kingdom===\n{{Main|Fourth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Cairo, Gizeh, Sphinx and Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] in front of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Giza]].]]\nThe Old Kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2613\u20132494 BC), which began with [[Sneferu]] (2613\u20132589 BC). After Djoser, Pharaoh Snefru was the next great pyramid builder. Snefru commissioned the building of not one, but three pyramids. The first is called the [[Meidum pyramid]], named for its location in Egypt. Snefru abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid. The Meidum pyramid was the first to have an above-ground burial chamber.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.penfield.edu/webpages/jgiotto/onlinetextbook.cfm?subpage=1525828|title=Ancient Egypt - the Archaic Period and Old Kingdom|website=www.penfield.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Using more stones than any other Pharaoh, he built the three pyramids: a now collapsed pyramid in [[Meidum]], the [[Bent Pyramid]] at [[Dahshur]], and the [[Red Pyramid]], at North Dahshur. However, the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at Saqqara, but during the building of 'The Great Pyramids' at Giza.<ref>Carl Roebuck (1984), ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 57.</ref>\n\nSneferu was succeeded by his son, [[Khufu]] (2589\u20132566 BC), who built the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. After Khufu's death, his sons [[Djedefra]] (2566\u20132558 BC) and [[Khafra]] (2558\u20132532 BC) may have quarrelled. The latter built the second pyramid and (in traditional thinking) the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] in [[Giza]]. Recent re-examination of evidence has led Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev to propose that the Sphinx had been built by [[Djedefra]] as a monument to his father Khufu.<ref>Vassil Dobrev, French Institute, Cairo, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1478998/I-have-solved-riddle-of-the-Sphinx-says-Frenchman.html link 1], [http://documentarystorm.com/riddle-of-the-sphinx/ link 2]</ref> Alternatively, the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafra and Khufu himself.\n\nThere were military expeditions into Canaan and Nubia, with Egyptian influence reaching up the Nile into what is today the Sudan.<ref>p.5, ''The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History'' (4th edition, 1993), Dupuy & Dupuy.</ref> The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were king [[Menkaure]] (2532\u20132504 BC), who built the smallest pyramid in Giza, [[Shepseskaf]] (2504\u20132498 BC) and, perhaps, [[Djedefptah]] (2498\u20132496 BC).\n[[File:Khufu CEM.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Khufu]], the builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza.]]\n\n===Fifth Dynasty===\n{{Main|Fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (2494\u20132345 BC) began with [[Userkaf]] (2494\u20132487 BC) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god [[Ra]]. Consequently, fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the Fourth Dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in [[Abusir]]. Userkaf was succeeded by his son [[Sahure]] (2487\u20132475 BC) who commanded an expedition to [[Kingdom of Punt|Punt]]. Sahure was in turn succeeded by [[Neferirkare Kakai]] (2475\u20132455 BC) who was Sahure's son. Neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary. He was followed by two short-lived kings, his son [[Neferefre]] (2455\u20132453&nbsp;BC) and [[Shepseskare]], the latter of uncertain parentage.<ref>Miroslav Verner: ''Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology'', Archiv Orient\u00e1ln\u00ed, Volume 69: 2001</ref> Shepseskare may have been deposed by Neferefre's brother [[Nyuserre Ini]] (2445\u20132421 BC), a long lived pharaoh who built extensively in Abusir and restarted royal activity in Giza.\n\nThe last Pharaohs of the dynasty were [[Menkauhor Kaiu]] (2421\u20132414 BC), [[Djedkare Isesi]] (2414\u20132375 BC) and  [[Unas]] (2375\u20132345), the earliest ruler to have the [[Pyramid Texts|pyramid texts]] inscribed in his pyramid.\n\nEgypt's expanding interests in trade goods such as [[ebony]], incense such as [[myrrh]] and [[frankincense]], gold, copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea. They traded with Lebanon for [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] and travelled the length of the Red Sea to the [[Kingdom of Punt]]\u2014possibly modern day Somalia\u2014for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs ([[treenail]]s) or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.\n\n===Decline into the First Intermediate Period===\n{{Main|Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|First Intermediate Period}}\n\nDuring the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (2345\u20132181 BC) the power of pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful [[nomarch]]s (regional governors). These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the Pharaoh. However, Nile flood control was still the subject of very large works, including especially the canal to [[Lake Moeris]] around 2300 BC, which was likely also the source of water to the [[Giza pyramid complex]] centuries earlier.\n\nInternal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of [[Pepi II]] (2278\u20132184 BC) towards the end of the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles.  The country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\n\nThe final blow was the [[22nd century BC drought]] in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation. For at least some years between 2200 and 2150 BC, this prevented the normal flooding of the [[Nile]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jean-Daniel Stanley|year=2003 |title=Nile flow failure at the end of the Old Kingdom, Egypt: Strontium isotopic and petrologic evidence |journal=[[Geoarchaeology (journal)|Geoarchaeology]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=395\u2013402 |doi=10.1002/gea.10065 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhatever its cause, the collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife. An important inscription on the tomb of [[Ankhtifi]], a [[nomarch]] during the early [[First Intermediate Period]], describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land.\n\n==Art==\nThe most defining feature of [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian art]] is its function, as that was the entire purpose of creation. Art was not made for enjoyment in the strictest sense, but rather served a role of some kind in Egyptian religion and ideology.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=The Art of Ancient Egypt |last=Robins |first=Gay |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2008 |location=Cambridge}}</ref> This fact manifests itself in the artistic style, even as it evolved over the dynasties. The three primary principles of that style, frontality, composite composition, and hierarchy scale, illustrates this quite well.<ref name=\":2\" /> These characteristics, initiated in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]]<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |title=A Companion to Ancient Egypt |volume=I |last=Sourouzian |first=Hourig |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |year=2010 |pages=853\u2013881}}</ref> and solidified during the Old Kingdom, persisted with some adaptability throughout the entirety of ancient Egyptian history as the foundation of its art.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |title=When the Pyramids Were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom |last=Arnold|first=Dorothea |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Rizzoli International Publications Inc. |year=1999 |pages=7\u201317}}</ref>\n[[File:False door from the tomb of Metjetji MET DT259192.jpg|thumb|left|False Door from the Tomb of Metjetji. ca. 2353-2323&nbsp;BC, Dynasty&nbsp;5-6, Old Kingdom. Tomb of Metjetji at Saqqara.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/543907 |title=The Metropolitan Museum}}</ref>]]\nFrontality, the first principle, indicates that art was viewed directly from the front. One was meant to approach a piece as they would a living individual, for it was meant to be a place of manifestation. The act of interaction would bring forth the divine entity represented in the art.<ref name=\":2\"/> It was therefore imperative that whomever was represented be as identifiable as possible. The guide lines developed in the Old Kingdom and the later grid system developed in the Middle Kingdom ensured that art was axial, symmetrical, proportional, and most importantly reproducible and therefore recognizable.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book |title=Proportion and Style in Ancient Egyptian Art |last=Robins |first=Gay |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1994}}</ref> Composite composition, the second principle, also contributes to the goal of identification. Multiple perspective were used in order to ensure that the onlooker could determine precisely what they saw.<ref name=\":2\"/> Though Egyptian art almost always includes descriptive text, literacy rates were not high, so the art gave another method for communicating the same information. One of the best examples of composite composition is the human form. In most two-dimensional relief, the head, legs, and feet are seen in profile, while the torso faces directly front. Another common example is an aerial view of a building or location.<ref name=\":2\"/> The third principle, hierarchy of scale, illustrates relative importance in society. The larger the figure, the more important the individual. The king is usually the largest, aside from deities. Similarity in size equated similarity in position. However, this is not to say that physical differences weren't shown as well. Women, for example, are usually shown as smaller than men. Children retain adult features and proportions, but are substantially smaller in size.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nAside from the three primary conventions, there are several characteristics that can help date a piece to a particular time frame. Proportions of the human figure are one of the most distinctive, as they vary between kingdoms.<ref name=\":3\"/> Old Kingdom male figures have characteristically broad shoulders and a long torso, with obvious musculature. On the other hand, females are narrower in the shoulders and waist, with longer legs and a shorter torso.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, in the Sixth Dynasty, the male figures lose their muscularity and their shoulders narrow. Eye also tend to get much larger.<ref name=\":2\"/> In order to help maintain the consistency of these proportions, the Egyptians used a series of eight guidelines to divide the body. They occurred at the following locations: the top of the head, the hairline, the base of the neck, the underarms, the tip of the elbow or the bottom of the ribcage, the top of the thigh at the bottom of the buttocks, the knee, and the middle of the lower leg.<ref name=\":3\"/> From the soles of the feet to the hairline was also divided into thirds, one-third between the soles and the knee, another third between the knee and the elbow, and the final third from the elbow to the hairline. The broad shoulders that appeared in the Fifth Dynasty constituted roughly that one-third length as well.<ref name=\":3\"/> These proportions not only help with the identification of representations and the reproduction of art, but also tie into the Egyptian ideal of order, which tied into the solar aspect of their religion and the inundations of the Nile.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nThough the above concepts apply to most, if not all, figures in Egyptian art, there are additional characteristics that applied to the representations of the king. Their appearance was not an exact rendering of the king's visage, though kings are somewhat identifiable through looks alone. Identification could be supplied by inscriptions or context.<ref name=\":2\"/> A huge, more important part of a king's portrayal was about the ideal of the office of kingship,<ref name=\":2\"/> which were dependent on the time period. The Old Kingdom was considered a golden age for Egypt, a grandiose height to which all future kingdoms aspired. As such, the king was portrayed as young vital, with features that agreed with the standards of beauty of the time. The musculature seen in male figures was also applied to kings. A royal rite, the jubilee run which was established during the Old Kingdom, involved the king running around a group of markers that symbolized the geographic borders of Egypt. This was meant to be a demonstration of the king's physical vigor, which determined his capacity to continue his reign.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Egyptian Art |last=Malek |first=Jaromir |publisher=Phaidon Press Limited |year=1999 |location=London}}</ref> This idea of kingly youth and strength were pervasive in the Old Kingdom and thus shown in the art.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n[[File:Menkaura.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Menkaure]] with [[Hathor]] and [[Anput]] from the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo. Demonstrates a group statue of graywacke with Old Kingdom features and proportions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalegyptianmuseum.org/detail.aspx?id=14994 |title=Statue of Menkaure with Hathor and Cynopolis |website=The Global Egyptian Museum}}</ref>]]\nSculpture was a major product of the Old Kingdom. The position of the figures in this period was mostly limited to sitting or standing, either with feet together or in the striding pose. Group statues of the king with either gods or family members, typically his wife and children, were also common.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIt was not just the subject of sculpture that was important, but also the material: The use of hard stone, such as gneiss, graywacke, schist, and granite, was relatively common in the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Lyvia |date=2011 |title=Enlivening the Body: Color and Stone Statues in Old Kingdom Egypt |journal=Notes in the History of Art |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=4\u201311 |doi=10.1086/sou.30.3.23208555}}</ref> The color of the stone had a great deal of symbolism and was chosen deliberately.<ref name=\":2\"/> Four colors were distinguished in the ancient Egyptian language: black, green, red, and white.<ref name=\":6\"/> Black was associated with Egypt due to the color of the soil after the Nile flood, green with vegetation and rebirth, red with the sun and its regenerative cycle, and white with purity.<ref name=\":2\"/> The statue of [[Menkaure]] with [[Hathor]] and [[Anput]] is an example of a typical Old Kingdom sculpture. The three figures display frontality and axiality, while fitting with the proportions of this time period. The graywacke came from the Eastern Desert in Egypt<ref>{{cite journal |last=Klemm |first=Dietrich |date=2001 |title=The Building Stones of Ancient Egypt: A Gift of its Geology |journal=African Earth Sciences |volume=33 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=631\u2013642 |doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)00085-9 |citeseerx=10.1.1.111.9099}}</ref> and is therefore associated with rebirth and the rising of the sun in the east.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Brewer, Douglas J.

The entire face of the community changed from a wilderness of Dutch and English properties to a planned suburban community of large stucco houses now affectionately known as \u201cLakers.\u201d During this single decade, the natural and architectural character of Mountain Lakes was developed. Hapgood was particularly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, at the height of its popularity in 1910 when he started building.\n\nThe Hapgood model homes were early forerunners of the modern development, but each house was modified to suit individual tastes. To the basic styles of these houses, Hapgood added colonial and craftsman features.  He reversed floor plans, and inter- changed architectural details. By the end of 1912, two hundred Hapgood homes were sold and occupied.  By 1923, approximately six hundred stucco houses were built to meet the overwhelming demand.

The entire face of the community changed from a wilderness of Dutch and English properties to a planned suburban community of large stucco houses now affectionately known as \u201cLakers.\u201d During this single decade, the natural and architectural character of Mountain Lakes was developed. Hapgood was particularly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, at the height of its popularity in 1910 when he started building.\n\nThe Hapgood model homes were early forerunners of the modern development, but each house was modified to suit individual tastes. To the basic styles of these houses, Hapgood added colonial and craftsman features.  He reversed floor plans, and inter- changed architectural details. By the end of 1912, two hundred Hapgood homes were sold and occupied.  By 1923, approximately six hundred stucco houses were built to meet the overwhelming demand. It became an independent town in 1924.<ref>[http://mtnlakes.org/about-mountain-lakes/our-history/ Our History], Borough of Mountain Lakes.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\">Ceduto durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Ceduto a stagione iniziata.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\">Acquistato durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=P}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.

She currently lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She has one daughter from her first marriage, Carmen Espinosa, a dancer and social worker. \n\n==Career==\nAt Harvard Espinosa studied with postmodern American novelist [[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]].  While at Columbia she sent several poems and sketches for critique to [[Anais Nin]], who was then a relatively unknown author.

She has taught at [[New College of California]], [[City College of San Francisco]], the [[University of Adelaide]], Australia, and [[Central New Mexico Community College]]. She has also led many informal writing workshops. Her poetry, articles, translations, and short fiction have appeared in numerous anthologies and periodicals.

The refractory business in Mount Union lasted from 1899 to about 1972, with limited production into the early 1990s.

The EBT maintained a large dual-gauge yard and coal cleaning plant in Mount Union and supplied coal to the Refractory plants. The EBT ceased operations in 1956 but the track is still in place and owned by the railroad.

It was at one time the world's largest producer of [[refractory]] material (silica brick), with three plants&nbsp;\u2013 General Refractories, United States Refractories, and Harbison Walker. The refractory business in Mount Union lasted from 1899 to about 1972, with limited production into the early 1990s. Other industries included two tanneries, a tanning extract plant, coal yards, an explosives and munitions plant (Aetna), and foundry and machine shops.\n\nMount Union was the northern terminus for the narrow gauge [[East Broad Top Railroad]], connecting to the Main Line of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Norfolk Southern). The EBT maintained a large dual-gauge yard and coal cleaning plant in Mount Union and supplied coal to the Refractory plants. The EBT ceased operations in 1956 but the track is still in place and owned by the railroad. From 1998 to 2010, the Mount Union Connecting Railroad attempted to reactivate the EBT main track through Mount Union and rehabilitated it, but only a couple cars were serviced and none moved over the EBT trackage.\n\nThe [[Mount Union Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994, with 300 significant historic structures, buildings, and homes.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> The population tally in 1900 was 1,086 which rose to 3,338 in 1910.\n\n==Today==\nThe culturally significant Thousand Steps of the [[Standing Stone Trail]] are located in the [[Jacks Narrows]] about 2 miles west of the town along [[U.S. Route 22]].

It was first opened in 1997 with the name of Pocono Mountain Elementary Center. The school changed its name to Clear Run to better reflect their local environment with Clear Run Creek behind the school. Clear Run originated with grades K through 6, but over the years it became K through 5, then ultimately split into two separate schools: Clear Run Elementary, grades K through 2, and Clear Run Intermediate, grades 3 to 6. Clear Run Intermediate was built right across the street in 2007.\n\nThe school's mascot is a panther and their colors are blue and gray. They chose their mascot because the vast woodlands and wetlands which surround the school were once home to panthers. In the gym there is a huge panther in the middle of the floor. Clear Run also had a huge panther teddy bear that was passed around from classmate to classmate based on good behavior. Students with the panther were allowed special privileges to carry around the bear everywhere that day and to sit on the stage part of the cafeteria, with four friends.\n                                                                                           \nThe schools colors were chosen to resemble the colors of the common panther. The school has over 800 students that attend grades k through 2 for \"Pocono Mountain School District is the largest, most diverse school district in northeast Pennsylvania\".\n\nClear Run is an environmental school where the teachers take care of the students\u2019 lives. On an everyday basis students and teachers create bonds where help is never far.  The school is also very multi-cultural. As the schools says \"All of the backgrounds and experiences that the students bring to our school make us a \"melting pot.\"  Clear Run for many years has had successful outcomes and statistics show that students that first enroll in Pocono Mountain Distinct usually graduate from it.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mt.

It was first opened in 1997 with the name of Pocono Mountain Elementary Center. The school changed its name to Clear Run to better reflect their local environment with Clear Run Creek behind the school. Clear Run originated with grades K through 6, but over the years it became K through 5, then ultimately split into two separate schools: Clear Run Elementary, grades K through 2, and Clear Run Intermediate, grades 3 to 6. Clear Run Intermediate was built right across the street in 2007.\n\nThe school's mascot is a panther and their colors are blue and gray. They chose their mascot because the vast woodlands and wetlands which surround the school were once home to panthers. In the gym there is a huge panther in the middle of the floor. Clear Run also had a huge panther teddy bear that was passed around from classmate to classmate based on good behavior. Students with the panther were allowed special privileges to carry around the bear everywhere that day and to sit on the stage part of the cafeteria, with four friends.\n                                                                                           \nThe schools colors were chosen to resemble the colors of the common panther. The school has over 800 students that attend grades k through 2 for \"Pocono Mountain School District is the largest, most diverse school district in northeast Pennsylvania\".  \n\nClear Run is an environmental school where the teachers take care of the students\u2019 lives. On an everyday basis students and teachers create bonds where help is never far.  The school is also very multi-cultural. As the schools says \"All of the backgrounds and experiences that the students bring to our school make us a \"melting pot.\"  Clear Run for many years has had successful outcomes and statistics show that students that first enroll in Pocono Mountain Distinct usually graduate from it.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mt.

Mount Pleasant Township is predominantly rural and adjoins the borough to the north.\n\nIn the past, Mount Pleasant was a center of an extensive [[coke (fuel)|coke]]-making industry.

However, the lives of coal miners in the outlying \"patch towns\" (company-owned mining towns) were arduous, and labor-management disputes became frequent.

It stands 45 miles (72&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Pittsburgh]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the borough's population was 4,454.\n\nThe Borough of Mount Pleasant, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with [[Mount Pleasant Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pleasant Township]], which is an entirely separate municipality. Mount Pleasant Township is predominantly rural and adjoins the borough to the north.\n\nIn the past, Mount Pleasant was a center of an extensive [[coke (fuel)|coke]]-making industry. Other products included flour, lumber, iron, glass, foundry products, etc.\n\n==History==\nThe year of Mount Pleasant's first non-Indian resident is not known, although one source states that at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], there was a settlement of \"not more than a half dozen houses.\"<ref name=\"Boucher\">{{cite book | last = Boucher | first = John N. | authorlink = | title = Old and New Westmoreland | publisher = American Historical Society | year = 1918 | location = New York, New York | pages = 485 | url = http://digital.library.pitt.edu/pittsburgh/ | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>  [[Braddock Road (Braddock expedition)]] passed through the western end of the future town in 1755, opening the area to settlement. In 1793 Michael Smith was licensed to operate an inn, which would have served traffic on Glades Road (sometimes spelled Glade Road), now [[Pennsylvania Route 31|Route 31]].<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> In 1797, Nathaniel Marshall sold land to Andrew McCready, who laid out the design of the town.<ref name=\"Boucher\"/>\n\n[[Jacob's Creek Bridge]], the first iron-chain suspension bridge built in the United States, was erected south of the town in 1801. It was demolished in 1833.\n\nUnfortunately, no pre-1800 structures remain within the borough limits. The borough's three oldest existing buildings all date from approximately 1812: The ''Shupe House'' at 201 Main Street, ''Hitchman House'' at 355 Main Street, and the ''Rupert Building'' at 642-644 Main Street.<ref name=\"MtPleasant-NRHP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/ |title=National Register of Historical Places \u2013 Mount Pleasant Historic District |accessdate=2008-05-10 |format=PDF |work=ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture & Archeology |publisher=Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission }}</ref>\n\nMount Pleasant became a borough on February 7, 1828.\n\nGlass manufacturing was a foundation of the local economy, with Bryce Brothers commencing operations in 1850, and L. E. Smith Glass<ref>[http://www.lesmithglass.com/ L. E. Smith Glass]</ref> in 1907.  The invention of the [[Bessemer process]] of steelmaking in 1859, which required [[coke (fuel)]], had a dramatic impact on the region.<ref name=\"MtPleasant-NRHP\"/> The town prospered as coal deposits were developed, from which coke was made. However, the lives of coal miners in the outlying \"patch towns\" (company-owned mining towns) were arduous, and labor-management disputes became frequent. The strike in Morewood, west of Mount Pleasant borough, was the most violent of the area's strikes, in which [[Morewood massacre|nine miners were killed by sheriff's deputies]] on April 3, 1891.<ref name=\"morewood-oldminer\">{{cite web |url=http://patheoldminer.rootsweb.ancestry.com/morewood2.html |title=Massacre at Morewood Mine & Coke Works, (Coal Miners Strike of 1891) |accessdate=2008-05-10 |last=Washlaski |first=Raymond A. |author2=Ryan P.
