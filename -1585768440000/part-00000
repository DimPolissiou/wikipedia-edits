Together with his backing group [[The Aces (Jamaican group)|The Aces]] (consisting of Wilson James and Easton Barrington Howard), he had one of the earliest international reggae hits with \"[[Israelites (song)|Israelites]]\" (1968). Other hits include \"[[007 (Shanty Town)]]\" (1967), \"[[It Miek]]\" (1969) and \"[[You Can Get It If You Really Want]]\" (1970).\n\n==Early life==\nDesmond Adolphus Dacres was born in [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish (Greater Kingston), Jamaica]], on 16 July 1941. Dekker spent his formative years in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. From a young age he regularly attended the local church with his grandmother and aunt. This early religious upbringing, as well as Dekker's enjoyment of singing hymns, led to a lifelong religious commitment. Following his mother's death, he moved to the parish of [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|St. Mary]] and later to [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas]]. While at St. Thomas, Dekker embarked on an apprenticeship as a tailor before returning to Kingston, where he became a [[welder]]. His workplace singing had drawn the attention of his co-workers, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2878/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Jo-Ann Greene |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref> In 1961 he auditioned for [[Coxsone Dodd]] ([[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]]) and [[Duke Reid]] (Treasure Isle), though neither audition was successful. The unsigned vocalist then auditioned for [[Leslie Kong]]'s [[Beverley's]] record label and was awarded his first recording contract.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Career==\nDespite achieving a record deal, it was two years before Dekker saw his first record released. Meanwhile, Dekker spotted the talent of one [[Bob Marley]], a fellow welder, and brought the youth to Kong's attention. In 1962 Judge Not and One Cup Of Coffee became the first recorded efforts of Marley, who retained gratitude, respect and admiration for Dekker for the rest of his life. Eventually in 1963 Kong chose \"Honour Your Mother and Father\" (written by Dekker and the song that Dekker had sung in his Kong audition two years earlier), which became a Jamaican hit and established Dekker's musical career. This was followed by the release of the tracks \"Sinners Come Home\" and \"Labour for Learning\". It was during this period that Desmond Dacres adopted the stage-name of Desmond Dekker. His fourth hit, \"King of Ska\" (backing vocals by The Cherrypies, also known as [[Toots & the Maytals|The Maytals]]), made him into one of the island's biggest stars. Dekker then recruited four brothers, Carl, Patrick, Clive and Barry Howard, as his permanent backing vocalists to perform with him under the name Desmond Dekker and The Aces.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nThe new group recorded a number of Jamaican hits, including \"Parents\", \"Get Up Edina\", \"This Woman\" and \"Mount Zion\". The themes of Dekker's songs during the first four years of his career dealt with the moral, cultural and social issues of mainstream Jamaican culture: respect for one's parents (\"Honour Your Mother and Father\"), religious morality (\"Sinners Come Home\") and education (\"Labour for Learning\"). In 1967 he appeared on [[Derrick Morgan]]'s \"Tougher Than Tough\", which helped begin a trend of popular songs commenting on the [[rude boy]] subculture which was rooted in Jamaican ghetto life where opportunities for advancement were limited and life was economically difficult. Dekker's own songs did not go to the extremes of many other popular rude boy songs, which reflected the violence and social problems associated with ghetto life, though he did introduce lyrics that resonated with the rude boys, starting with one of his best-known songs, \"[[007 (Shanty Town)]]\". The song established Dekker as a rude boy icon in Jamaica and also became a favourite dance track for the young working-class men and women of the United Kingdom's [[mod (subculture)|mod]] scene.<ref name=Telegraphobit>{{cite news|title=Desmond Dekker|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1519534/Desmond-Dekker.html|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 May 2006}}</ref> \"007 (Shanty Town)\" was a Top 15 hit in the UK and his UK concerts were attended by a large following of mods wherever he played.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nDekker continued to release rude boy songs such as \"Rude Boy Train\" and \"Rudie Got Soul\", as well as mainstream cultural songs like \"It's a Shame\", \"Wise Man\", \"Hey Grandma\", \"Unity\", \"If It Pays\", \"Mother's Young Girl\", \"Sabotage\" and \"Pretty Africa\".<ref>On the 22 August 1970 edition of American Top 40, Casey Kasem claimed that Dekker had more than 40 #1 records in Jamaica.</ref>  Many of the hits from this era came from his debut album, ''007 (Shanty Town)''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Dekker's \"[[Israelites (song)|Israelites]]\" was released, eventually topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April 1969 and peaking in the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 1969.  Dekker was the first Jamaican artist to have a hit record in the US with a form and style that was purely Jamaican.  That same year saw the release of \"Beautiful and Dangerous\", \"Writing on the Wall\", \"Music Like Dirt (Intensified '68)\" (which won the 1968 [[Jamaica Independence Festival#Popular Song Competition|Jamaica Independence Festival Song Contest]]), \"Bongo Girl\" and \"Shing a Ling\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> 1969 saw the release of \"[[It Mek]]\", which became a hit both in Jamaica and the UK.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/desmond%20dekker%20%26%20the%20aces \"UK Official Chart Hits for Desmond Dekker\"] Retrieved 26 January 2013.</ref> Dekker also released \"Problems\" and \"Pickney Gal\", both of which were popular in Jamaica, although only \"Pickney Gal\" managed to chart in the UK Top 50.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1969 Dekker took permanent residency in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desmond Dekker|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2006/06/desmond-dekker/|publisher=www.thestage.co.uk|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970 Dekker released \"You Can Get It If You Really Want\", written by [[Jimmy Cliff]], which reached No. 2 in the UK charts.  Dekker was initially reluctant to record the track but was eventually persuaded to do so by [[Leslie Kong]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Dekker's version uses the same backing track as Cliff's original.  Kong, whose music production skills had been a crucial part of both Dekker's and Cliff's careers, died in 1971, affecting the careers of both artists for a short period of time.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  In 1972 the rude boy film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' was released and Dekker's \"007 (Shanty Town)\" was featured on [[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] along with Cliff's version of \"You Can Get It...\", as well as other Jamaican artists' hits, giving reggae more international exposure and preparing the way for [[Bob Marley]].\n\nIn 1975 \"Israelites\" was re-released and became a UK Top 10 hit for a second time.  Dekker had also begun working on new material with the production duo Bruce Anthony in 1974.  In 1975 this collaboration resulted in the release of \"[[Sing a Little Song]]\", which charted in the UK Top Twenty; this was to be his last UK hit.\n\n===1980s and later===\nThe 1980s found Dekker signed to a new label, [[Stiff Records]], an independent label that specialized in [[punk rock|punk]] and new wave acts as well as releases associated with the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] label, whose acts instigated a short-lived but influential ska revival. He recorded an album called ''Black & Dekker'' (1980), which featured his previous hits backed by [[Graham Parker & the Rumour|The Rumour]], [[Graham Parker]]'s backing band and [[Akrylykz]] (featuring [[Roland Gift]], later of [[Fine Young Cannibals]]).<ref name=\"Albums\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r856772|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Black & Dekker > Credits )))}}</ref> A re-recorded version of \"Israelites\" was released in 1980 on the Stiff label, followed by other new recordings: Jimmy Cliff's \"[[Many Rivers to Cross]]\" and \"Book of Rules\". Dekker's next album, ''Compass Point'' (1981), was produced by [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]. Despite declining sales, Dekker remained a popular live performer and continued to tour with The Rumour.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1984 he was declared bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5018910.stm |title=Reggae legend Desmond Dekker dies |publisher=BBC News |date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/52152/pages/9831/page.pdf \"London Gazette Notice 29th May 1990\"].

The song established Dekker as a rude boy icon in Jamaica and also became a favourite dance track for the young working-class men and women of the United Kingdom's [[mod (subculture)|mod]] scene.<ref name=Telegraphobit>{{cite news|title=Desmond Dekker|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1519534/Desmond-Dekker.html|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 May 2006}}</ref> \"007 (Shanty Town)\" was a Top 15 hit in the UK and his UK concerts were attended by a large following of mods wherever he played.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nDekker continued to release rude boy songs such as \"Rude Boy Train\" and \"Rudie Got Soul\", as well as mainstream cultural songs like \"It's a Shame\", \"Wise Man\", \"Hey Grandma\", \"Unity\", \"If It Pays\", \"Mother's Young Girl\", \"Sabotage\" and \"Pretty Africa\".<ref>On the 22 August 1970 edition of American Top 40, Casey Kasem claimed that Dekker had more than 40 #1 records in Jamaica.</ref>  Many of the hits from this era came from his debut album, ''007 (Shanty Town)''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Dekker's \"[[Israelites (song)|Israelites]]\" was released, eventually topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April 1969 and peaking in the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 1969.  Dekker was the first Jamaican artist to have a hit record in the US with a form and style that was purely Jamaican.  That same year saw the release of \"Beautiful and Dangerous\", \"Writing on the Wall\", \"Music Like Dirt (Intensified '68)\" (which won the 1968 [[Jamaica Independence Festival#Popular Song Competition|Jamaica Independence Festival Song Contest]]), \"Bongo Girl\" and \"Shing a Ling\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> 1969 saw the release of \"[[It Mek]]\", which became a hit both in Jamaica and the UK.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/desmond%20dekker%20%26%20the%20aces \"UK Official Chart Hits for Desmond Dekker\"] Retrieved 26 January 2013.</ref> Dekker also released \"Problems\" and \"Pickney Gal\", both of which were popular in Jamaica, although only \"Pickney Gal\" managed to chart in the UK Top 50.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1969 Dekker took permanent residency in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desmond Dekker|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2006/06/desmond-dekker/|publisher=www.thestage.co.uk|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970 Dekker released \"You Can Get It If You Really Want\", written by [[Jimmy Cliff]], which reached No. 2 in the UK charts.  Dekker was initially reluctant to record the track but was eventually persuaded to do so by [[Leslie Kong]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Dekker's version uses the same backing track as Cliff's original.  Kong, whose music production skills had been a crucial part of both Dekker's and Cliff's careers, died in 1971, affecting the careers of both artists for a short period of time.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  In 1972 the rude boy film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' was released and Dekker's \"007 (Shanty Town)\" was featured on [[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] along with Cliff's version of \"You Can Get It...\", as well as other Jamaican artists' hits, giving Reggae more international exposure and preparing the way for [[Bob Marley]].\n\nIn 1975 \"Israelites\" was re-released and became a UK Top 10 hit for a second time.  Dekker had also begun working on new material with the production duo Bruce Anthony in 1974.  In 1975 this collaboration resulted in the release of \"[[Sing a Little Song]]\", which charted in the UK Top Twenty; this was to be his last UK hit.\n\n===1980s and later===\nThe 1980s found Dekker signed to a new label, [[Stiff Records]], an independent label that specialized in [[punk rock|punk]] and new wave acts as well as releases associated with the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] label, whose acts instigated a short-lived but influential ska revival. He recorded an album called ''Black & Dekker'' (1980), which featured his previous hits backed by [[Graham Parker & the Rumour|The Rumour]], [[Graham Parker]]'s backing band and [[Akrylykz]] (featuring [[Roland Gift]], later of [[Fine Young Cannibals]]).<ref name=\"Albums\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r856772|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Black & Dekker > Credits )))}}</ref> A re-recorded version of \"Israelites\" was released in 1980 on the Stiff label, followed by other new recordings: Jimmy Cliff's \"[[Many Rivers to Cross]]\" and \"Book of Rules\".

It is centred {{convert|7.2|mi}} south-west of [[Charing Cross]]. Originally a village in the county of [[Surrey]], today it is mainly a residential [[suburb]]. Localities within Mitcham include Mitcham Town Centre and [[Mitcham Common]]. Amenities include [[Mitcham Library]] and [[Mitcham Cricket Green]]. Nearby major districts are [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Streatham]], [[Croydon]], [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], [[Merton Park]], [[Tooting]], [[Morden]] and [[Sutton, London|Sutton]]. Mitcham, most broadly defined, had a population of 63,393 in 2011, formed from six wards including [[Pollards Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202755/http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nMitcham is in the east of the [[London Borough of Merton]]. Mitcham is close to [[Morden]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Croydon]], [[Streatham]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Tooting]]. The [[River Wandle]] bounds the town to the southwest. The original village lies in the west. [[Mitcham Common]] takes up the greater part of the boundary and area to the south.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Parish Church Mitcham (28833007202).jpg|thumb|Mitcham Parish Church, Church Road, dates in part to the Saxon era.]]\n[[File:Mitcham clock tower (geograph 1853146).jpg|thumb|Mitcham Clock tower]]\nThe [[Toponymy|toponym]] \"Mitcham\" is [[Old English]] in origin and means ''big settlement''. Before the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] and [[Saxons]] were present, stood a [[Britons (historical)|Celtic]] settlement, with evidence of a [[hill fort]] in the Pollards Hill area. The discovery of Roman-era graves and a well on the site of the Mitcham gasplant evince Roman settlement. The Anglo-Saxon graveyard on the north bank of the Wandle is the largest discovered to date, and many of the finds therein are on display in the [[British Museum]]. Scholars such as Myres have suggested that Mitcham and other Thames plain settlements were some of the first populated by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. What became the parish lands could have hosted the [[Battle of Merton]], 871, in which King [[Ethelred of Wessex]] was either mortally wounded or killed outright. The [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|St Peter and St Paul]] dates from the early [[Kingdom of England]]. Mostly rebuilt in 1819\u20131821, the current building retains the original Saxon tower. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 lists Mitcham as a small [[farming]] community, an implied estimate of 250 people, living in two [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]]: Mitcham, the area today being Upper Mitcham; and Whitford (Lower Green).\n\nThe area lay in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] county subdivision of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]].\n\nThe Domesday Book records Mitcham as ''Michelham''. It was held partly by the Canons of [[Bayeux]]; partly by William, son of Ansculf and partly by Osbert.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/surrey1.html#mitcham | title=Surrey | website=The Domesday Book online \u2013 Surrey}}</ref> Its domesday assets were: 8 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s and 1 [[virgate]]. It had \u00bd [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth \u00a31, 3\u00bd [[plough]]s, {{convert|56|acre}} of [[meadow]]. It rendered \u00a34 5s 4d, a time when a [[pound sterling]] still implied something similar to a pound of silver.\n\nDuring her reign [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] made at least five visits to the area. [[John Donne]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] also had residences here in this era. It was at this time that Mitcham became gentrified, as due to the abundance of [[lavender]] fields Mitcham became renowned for its soothing air. The air also led people to settle in the area during times of [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nWhen [[industrialisation]] occurred, Mitcham quickly grew to become a town and most of the farms were swallowed up in the expansion. Remnants of this farming history today include: Mitcham Common itself; Arthur's Pond on the corner of Watney's Road and Commonside East, and named for a local farmer; Alfred Mizen School (Garden Primary School), named after a local nurseryman charitable towards the burgeoning town; and the road New Barnes Avenue, replacing part of New Barn(e)s Farm.\n\n[[File:Potter&Moore.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Potter & Moore aftershave, made with Mitcham lavender]]\nMany lavender fields were in Mitcham, and [[peppermint]] and lavender oils were also [[distillation|distilled]]. In 1749 two local [[Herb garden|physic gardeners]], John Potter and William Moore, founded a company to make and market toiletries made from locally grown herbs and flowers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://potterandmoore.com/about-us/ | title=Potter and Moore \u2013 An Introduction | website=Potter & Moore}}</ref> Lavender features on Merton Council's coat of arms and the badge of the local football team, [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.]], as well as in the name of a local council ward, Lavender Field.\n\nMitcham was industrialised first along the banks of the Wandle, where [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[copper]], flour, [[iron]] and [[dye]] were all worked. Mitcham, along with nearby [[Merton Abbey, London|Merton Abbey]], became the [[Calico (fabric)|calico cloth]] printing centres of England by 1750. [[Asprey]], suppliers of luxury goods made from various materials, was founded in Mitcham as a [[silk]]-printing business in 1781. [[William Morris]] opened a factory on the River Wandle at Merton Abbey. Merton Abbey Mills were the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] silk-printing works. It is now a craft village and its waterwheel has been preserved.\n\nActivity along the Wandle led to the building of the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the world's first public railway, in 1803. The decline and failure of the railway in the 1840s also heralded a change in industry, as horticulture gradually gave way to [[manufacturing]], with [[paint]], [[varnish]], [[linoleum]] and [[firework]] manufacturers moving into the area. The work provided and migratory patterns eventually resulted in a doubling of the population between the years 1900 and 1910.\n\nIn 1829 Miss Mary Tate donated land and money to build almshouses on the site of the former Tate family home in Cricket Green. The buildings were designed in a Tudor style by John Butcher and established to accommodate twelve poor widows or spinsters of the parish. Miss Tate was the only surviving member of the Tate family, who had lived from about 1700 in a large mansion on the site of the almshouses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://photoarchive.merton.gov.uk/collections/buildings/almshouses/97774-mary-tate-alms|title=Mary Tate Almshouses \u2013 Merton Memories Photographic Archive|website=photoarchive.merton.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/0b39ce3f-0ca1-4300-ae4b-d651a8bf1892|title=MISS TATE'S ALMSHOUSES, MITCHAM|language=English}}</ref> The gardens at the rear of the property were originally provided for the use of residents, but later informally rented out as allotments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.php?ID=MER028|title=Mary Tate Almshouses|website=www.londongardensonline.org.uk|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nMitcham became a borough, within a two-tier council system, on 19 September 1934 with the charter of incorporation being presented to the 84-year-old mayor, Mr. R.M.

Mitcham is close to [[Morden]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Croydon]], [[Streatham]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Tooting]]. The [[River Wandle]] bounds the town to the southwest. The original village lies in the west. [[Mitcham Common]] takes up the greater part of the boundary and area to the south.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Parish Church Mitcham (28833007202).jpg|thumb|Mitcham Parish Church, Church Road, dates in part to the Saxon era.]]\n[[File:Mitcham clock tower (geograph 1853146).jpg|thumb|Mitcham Clock tower]]\nThe [[Toponymy|toponym]] \"Mitcham\" is [[Old English]] in origin and means ''big settlement''. Before the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] and [[Saxons]] were present, stood a [[Britons (historical)|Celtic]] settlement, with evidence of a [[hill fort]] in the Pollards Hill area. The discovery of Roman-era graves and a well on the site of the Mitcham gasplant evince Roman settlement. The Anglo-Saxon graveyard on the north bank of the Wandle is the largest discovered to date, and many of the finds therein are on display in the [[British Museum]]. Scholars such as Myres have suggested that Mitcham and other Thames plain settlements were some of the first populated by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. What became the parish lands could have hosted the [[Battle of Merton]], 871, in which King [[Ethelred of Wessex]] was either mortally wounded or killed outright. The [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|St Peter and St Paul]] dates from the early [[Kingdom of England]]. Mostly rebuilt in 1819\u20131821, the current building retains the original Saxon tower. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 lists Mitcham as a small [[farming]] community, an implied estimate of 250 people, living in two [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]]: Mitcham, the area today being Upper Mitcham; and Whitford (Lower Green).\n\nThe area lay in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] county subdivision of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]].\n\nThe Domesday Book records Mitcham as ''Michelham''. It was held partly by the Canons of [[Bayeux]]; partly by William, son of Ansculf and partly by Osbert.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/surrey1.html#mitcham | title=Surrey | website=The Domesday Book online \u2013 Surrey}}</ref> Its domesday assets were: 8 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s and 1 [[virgate]]. It had \u00bd [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth \u00a31, 3\u00bd [[plough]]s, {{convert|56|acre}} of [[meadow]]. It rendered \u00a34 5s 4d, a time when a [[pound sterling]] still implied something similar to a pound of silver.\n\nDuring her reign [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] made at least five visits to the area. [[John Donne]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] also had residences here in this era. It was at this time that Mitcham became gentrified, as due to the abundance of [[lavender]] fields Mitcham became renowned for its soothing air. The air also led people to settle in the area during times of [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nWhen [[industrialisation]] occurred, Mitcham quickly grew to become a town and most of the farms were swallowed up in the expansion. Remnants of this farming history today include: Mitcham Common itself; Arthur's Pond on the corner of Watney's Road and Commonside East, and named for a local farmer; Alfred Mizen School (Garden Primary School), named after a local nurseryman charitable towards the burgeoning town; and the road New Barnes Avenue, replacing part of New Barn(e)s Farm.\n\n[[File:Potter&Moore.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Potter & Moore aftershave, made with Mitcham lavender]]\nMany lavender fields were in Mitcham, and [[peppermint]] and lavender oils were also [[distillation|distilled]]. In 1749 two local [[Herb garden|physic gardeners]], John Potter and William Moore, founded a company to make and market toiletries made from locally grown herbs and flowers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://potterandmoore.com/about-us/ | title=Potter and Moore \u2013 An Introduction | website=Potter & Moore}}</ref> Lavender features on Merton Council's coat of arms and the badge of the local football team, [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.]], as well as in the name of a local council ward, Lavender Field.\n\nMitcham was industrialised first along the banks of the Wandle, where [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[copper]], flour, [[iron]] and [[dye]] were all worked. Mitcham, along with nearby [[Merton Abbey, London|Merton Abbey]], became the [[Calico (fabric)|calico cloth]] printing centres of England by 1750. [[Asprey]], suppliers of luxury goods made from various materials, was founded in Mitcham as a [[silk]]-printing business in 1781. [[William Morris]] opened a factory on the River Wandle at Merton Abbey. Merton Abbey Mills were the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] silk-printing works. It is now a craft village and its waterwheel has been preserved.\n\nActivity along the Wandle led to the building of the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the world's first public railway, in 1803. The decline and failure of the railway in the 1840s also heralded a change in industry, as horticulture gradually gave way to [[manufacturing]], with [[paint]], [[varnish]], [[linoleum]] and [[firework]] manufacturers moving into the area. The work provided and migratory patterns eventually resulted in a doubling of the population between the years 1900 and 1910.\n\nIn 1829 Miss Mary Tate donated land and money to build almshouses on the site of the former Tate family home in Cricket Green. The buildings were designed in a Tudor style by John Butcher and established to accommodate twelve poor widows or spinsters of the parish. Miss Tate was the only surviving member of the Tate family, who had lived from about 1700 in a large mansion on the site of the almshouses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://photoarchive.merton.gov.uk/collections/buildings/almshouses/97774-mary-tate-alms|title=Mary Tate Almshouses \u2013 Merton Memories Photographic Archive|website=photoarchive.merton.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/0b39ce3f-0ca1-4300-ae4b-d651a8bf1892|title=MISS TATE'S ALMSHOUSES, MITCHAM|language=English}}</ref> The gardens at the rear of the property were originally provided for the use of residents, but later informally rented out as allotments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.php?ID=MER028|title=Mary Tate Almshouses|website=www.londongardensonline.org.uk|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nMitcham became a borough, within a two-tier council system, on 19 September 1934 with the charter of incorporation being presented to the 84-year-old mayor, Mr. R.M.

In 2004, facing the imposition of flight limits at O'Hare by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], United and American agreed to modify their flight schedules to help reduce congestion caused by clustered arrivals and departures, mainly by adjusting the schedules of their regional carriers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hilkevitch|first1=Jon|title=Regional jets jam O'Hare|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-02-18/news/0402180332_1_regional-jet-regional-jets-american-airlines|website=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=March 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401075608/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-02-18/news/0402180332_1_regional-jet-regional-jets-american-airlines|archive-date=April 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhile reducing the practice of banking helped, the reality was that the airfield had remained unchanged since the addition of its last new runway (4R/22L) in 1971.<ref>Flightguide Vol. II,Revision 5/71, Airguide Publications/Monty Navarre, Monterrey CA</ref> O'Hare's three pairs of angled runways were meant to allow takeoffs into the wind, but they came at a cost: the various intersecting runways were both dangerous and inefficient.

Construction of the two new airfield layouts and the new cargo area, while the space-constrained airport continued full operations, presented significant time and capacity challenges. The north airfield gained runway 9L/27R in 2008, while the south airfield saw the opening of runway 10C/28C in 2013 and runway 10R/28L in 2015.

Construction of the two new airfield layouts and the new cargo area, while the space-constrained airport continued full operations, presented significant time and capacity challenges. The north airfield gained runway 9L/27R in 2008, while the south airfield saw the opening of runway 10C/28C in 2013 and runway 10R/28L in 2015.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe municipality of Bagamanoc is located at the north-eastern part of the province of Catanduanes directly facing the vast Pacific Ocean. Its total land is {{convert|80.74|km2}}, and is about {{convert|62|km}} north from the capital town of Virac. Its location is somewhat disadvantageous in its quest for development because of its distance form the capital town and most in particular it is open to the sea, whereby typhoon surge often wrought havoc to the shorelines particularly to the built-up areas during typhoons.\n\nBagamanoc is located between latitude 13*53\u201900\u201d and longitude 124*11\u201900\u201d to 124*23\u201900\u201d. It is bounded on the eastern side by the Pacific Ocean, on the north-western side by the municipality of Pandan, western side by the municipality of Caramoran, and on the south by the municipality of Panganiban.\n\n===Topography===\n\nAlmost 83% of the entire land area of the municipality are mountainous and hilly wherein 56% (43.65 square kilometers) of it is covered by thick forest and 44% or 34.30 square kilometers are planted with abaca, coconut, root crops and perennial trees. The lowland or plain area is about 17% of the total land are or 15.96 square kilometers which comprises the built-up areas, rice land, diversified agricultural lands and others. The mountainous area is located at the western part of the municipality and the hilly or rolling terrain lies eastward to the coastal areas, while the lowland or plain areas are situated along the coastal and river banks.\n\n===Geological features===\n\nThe structure of the earth's surface of the town is composed predominantly of upper Miocene-Pliocene (shale and sandstone sequence) located along the western and northern part of the municipality. Likewise Recent (Alluvium) layers is found along the coastal river bank areas and Cretaceous Paleocene (metamorphic rock) and Pliocene Pleistocene (conglomerate formation) are found at Late and Panay island.\n\n===Soil classification===\n\nThe municipal soil is composed of four (4) types, namely: Undifferential Mountain soil, Louisiana Clay, Hydrosol, Bantog Clay and traces of Beach Sand mostly along the coastal areas.\n\n===Climate===\n\nLike other municipalities of the eastern section of the province and province itself, the climate of the municipality is [[Climate of the Philippines|type II of the Coronas Classification]] for climatic zones, best described as having no distinct dry season with a very pronounced rainfall, usually heavy during the month from October to January. Typhoons are very much prevalent in this locality due to its geographical positioning fronting the Pacific Ocean.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Bagamanoc, Catanduanes\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 27\n| Jan low C  = 22\n| Feb high C = 27\n| Feb low C  = 22\n| Mar high C = 28\n| Mar low C  = 23\n| Apr high C = 30\n| Apr low C  = 24\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 25\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 25\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 28\n| Nov low C  = 24\n| Dec high C = 27\n| Dec low C  = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 138\n| Feb precipitation mm = 83\n| Mar precipitation mm = 74\n| Apr precipitation mm = 50\n| May precipitation mm = 108\n| Jun precipitation mm = 165\n| Jul precipitation mm = 202\n| Aug precipitation mm = 165\n| Sep precipitation mm = 190\n| Oct precipitation mm = 186\n| Nov precipitation mm = 188\n| Dec precipitation mm = 183\n| Jan rain days        = 16.8\n| Feb rain days        = 11.9\n| Mar rain days        = 13.5\n| Apr rain days        = 13.8\n| May rain days        = 20.5\n| Jun rain days        = 25.2\n| Jul rain days        = 27.4\n| Aug rain days        = 26.2\n| Sep rain days        = 26.1\n| Oct rain days        = 24.7\n| Nov rain days        = 20.7\n| Dec rain days        = 18.5\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/bagamanoc_philippines_1729195\n| title =  Bagamanoc, Catanduanes : Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 December 2018}}</ref>\n| date = 29 December 2018\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nBagamanoc is politically subdivided into 18 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|- \n!Barangay\n!Population<br><small>(2010)</small>{{PH census|2010}}\n!Population<br><small>(2007)</small>\n!Change\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Antipolo\n|{{change|invert=on|839|785}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bacak\n|{{change|invert=on|476|423}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bagatabao\n|{{change|invert=on|738|710}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bugao\n|{{change|invert=on|761|705}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Cahan\n|{{change|invert=on|241|254}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Hinipaan\n|{{change|invert=on|617|456}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Magsaysay\n|{{change|invert=on|715|616}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Poblacion\n|{{change|invert=on|931|779}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Quezon (''Pancayanan'')\n|{{change|invert=on|344|329}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Quigaray\n|{{change|invert=on|278|306}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Sagrada\n|{{change|invert=on|955|793}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Salvacion (''Panuto'')\n|{{change|invert=on|522|458}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Isidro\n|{{change|invert=on|834|760}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Rafael (''Mahantod'')\n|{{change|invert=on|547|458}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Vicente\n|{{change|invert=on|969|845}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Santa Mesa\n|{{change|invert=on|278|268}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Santa Teresa\n|{{change|invert=on|655|585}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Suchan\n|{{change|invert=on|670|653}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n\nAt what is known as Bagatabao, but more island of the swamp, Bagamanocnons now called Taraga, there was already a chicken raising settlement place on the inhospitable plateau of Panay Island (Catanduanes).\n\nThe settlement was bounded on the east and north by the sea, blocked by a swamp and a hostile hill on the south and pressed by the crocodile-infested mouth of what is now known as the Bagamanoc River on the west. Confined to a limited territory by natural forces, the settlement could hardly feed and shelter itself. Moreover, frequent raids by corsairs from Mindanao, Jolo or Borneo for slaves posed a serious problem to their existence.\n\nOne day, a daring and adventurous young man from the tribe forced his way across the mouth of the river to look for rattan needed for the repair of his future bride's family house. Going westward by the shoreline, he finally turned left for the business of venture but before he cut an uphill distance, he saw what appeared to be a chicken flying along just above the tallest leaves of pandan shrubs festooning the sea. Back in his tribe, he told the clan on what he saw of the beauty of the place, its abundance with food and building materials and the defense is offered from the pirate's raid. But as the place has no name to say when referring to that \u201cdiscovered land\u201d every time anybody talk of the place, they would call it \u201cBAGAMANOC\u201d which means the place was like a \u201cchicken\u201d the very meaning of Bagamanoc.\n\nTo detect the coming of the Moro raids, the people erected a watchtower where the sea laps at the shore nearest the present Municipal Hall. In spite of the tower, many Bagamanocnons still fell into the corsairs\u2019 hand. When the Spaniards came, they found the place a thriving community. They converted the people into Christianity and made a settlement into a municipality under a governadorcillo. Under Spain, the town people constructed a concrete church and municipal hall of stones, limes, molasses and eggs. However, even under the Spaniard rule, Bagamanocnons did not fully submit to the Spanish dominion, although fully sold out to Christianity. During the revolution of 1898-1901, the Bagamanocnon relied their support to the Filipino Revolutionist. In fact, a bloody skirmish took place at Mapulang Labo, where then Apolonio Cueva skillfully beheaded an American Officer mounted on a horse. When the Americans reorganized the municipal government, the town was reduced to a mere town of Viga, later of Payo, until Bagamanoc became a municipality again in 1950.\n\nBagamanoc is used to be called a small town of big people and properly so. She had produced a hundred of professionals scattered all over the archipelago who in their modest way are making a name for themselves and for their birthplace. The country's representative to the \u201cTokyo Olympic Games\u201d in 1924. in the discus throwing event came from this town and the second Catanduanes congressman under an independent Philippines hails from here. As of lately and during the time where the American Bases are still here in the Philippines,Bagamanoc has also been the site of the LORAN ( Long Range Navigation Facilities ) Station primarily installed to protect the country from external threats, among others.\n\nBagamanoc was created from barrios of Quigaray, Hinipagan, Sukhan in the island of Panay; Lati, in the island of Lati; Bacac, Hinipaan, Bugao, Minaili and Bagamanoc of the municipality of [[Panganiban, Catanduanes|Panganiban]] by virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 491 which was approved on June 12, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra491.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711025131/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra491.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=An act creating the municipality of Bagamanoc in the province of Catanduanes |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe municipal councils of Bagamanoc and Panganiban agreed on the boundary of the two towns on June 12, 1952.

Large parcel of riceland are situated at barangays Quezon, Santa Tersa, Antipolo and Bagatabao Magsaysay, and Bugao. Abaca and coconut plantation are found inn all barangay, except barangays Poblacion, Santa Mesa and Santa Teresa.\n\nThe municipality is not identified as a key Livestock Development Area but there are areas in some barangays which are conducive to livestock raising particularly [[carabao]] and cattle. These are barangays San Isidro and Suchan. Livestock raising in the municipality are mostly backyard and as work animals.\n\nIdentified fishing development areas are the barangays of Quezon, Batabao, Quigaray and Suchan. Most of these fishponds are now for family subsistence and not for commercial production due to its physical state. Asides from the fishponds, large fishing ground abounds in the locality being a coastal area. These are the Bagamanoc Bay. Loroman, Late and Quigaray Cove.\n\n===Commerce and Trade Sector===\n\nThe municipality does not have any big commercial establishment nor have much trade and commercial activities to speak of. Existing are about 96 locally registered and license commercial establishment throughout the municipality ranging from a small eatery to retail and wholesale stores. Most of the bigger stores are found at the municipal commercial strip or commercial business district.\n\nBesides from the commercial strip, the municipality has the Municipal Public Market, which is strategically located near the slaughterhouse, Municipal Training Hall and the Bus and Jeepney Terminal.\n\nAlmost all the commercial consumers products are being bought at commercial establishments at Virac, which are brought home daily loaded on a passenger's jeepney/bus or a cargo truck. Agricultural crops are sold directly to buying commercial establishment at Virac.\n\n===Tourism===\n\nThere is no specific tourism activities in the municipality, although there are potential areas endowed with natural attributes and resources that are conducive to recreation, leisure and other wholesome experiences which can provide the purpose for visitors, excursionist and vacationist.

There are also some river and falls where in anybody could have some picnic or excursion. There is also the former LORAN Station Buildings (US Coast Guard Station) located atop a hill and overlooking coastal strips of beaches and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAmong those potential sites are the falls at Paday along Panuto and Maragkiw River at Bacak, Pantalan at Caningan River, Quezon and Cagnipa at Barangay San Vicente overlooking the sea and a nsilet. Included are the strip of beaches like Bugao-Pogtangan Beach, Late Beach and Cabusiw-Dayhagan Beaches along the blue seas and corals where in one can do swimming and scuba diving.\n\n===Industry===\n\nThe municipality is an agricultural base community whereby necessary resources for agro-industrial undertakings are available. Abundant raw materials from the forest and other agricultural products could be utilized for a cottage or home industry. The vast seas could be tapped as source for raw materials for fish and marine processing business and other livelihood activities for the local fisher folks. Besides form the abundant raw materials, adequate labor force is readily available.\n\nThere are no established industry in the locality, what present are small scale rice mills, an off and on small home furniture, leather wear and nipa shingle making.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060516155544/http://www.bagamanoc-catanduanes.gov.ph/ Municipality of Bagamanoc]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n*[http://bagamanoc.blogspot.com/  Planet Bagamanoc]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Bagamanoc\n|North     = [[Pandan, Catanduanes|Pandan]]\n|East      = ''[[Philippine Sea]]''\n|South     = [[Panganiban, Catanduanes|Panganiban]]\n|West      = [[Caramoran, Catanduanes|Caramoran]]\n}}\n{{Catanduanes}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Catanduanes]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline          =  \n| image_caption          = \n| image_seal             =   \n| seal_size              = 100x80px\n| image_map              = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption            = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1             = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map            = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates            = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type        = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1      = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2      = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2      = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name          = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology              =  <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for              =  <!--named after (if person or place)-->\n| native_name            =\n| other_name             =\n| nickname               =\n| motto                  =\n| anthem                 =\n| subdivision_type3      = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Legislative district of Catanduanes|Lone district]]\n| established_title      = Founded\n| established_date       = June 12, 1950\n| parts_type             = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style            = para\n| p1                     = 18 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title           = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name            = Remegio B.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe municipality of Bagamanoc is located at the north-eastern part of the province of Catanduanes directly facing the vast Pacific Ocean. Its total land is {{convert|80.74|km2}}, and is about {{convert|62|km}} north from the capital town of Virac. Its location is somewhat disadvantageous in its quest for development because of its distance form the capital town and most in particular it is open to the sea, whereby typhoon surge often wrought havoc to the shorelines particularly to the built-up areas during typhoons.\n\nBagamanoc is located between latitude 13*53\u201900\u201d and longitude 124*11\u201900\u201d to 124*23\u201900\u201d. It is bounded on the eastern side by the Pacific Ocean, on the north-western side by the municipality of Pandan, western side by the municipality of Caramoran, and on the south by the municipality of Panganiban.\n\n===Topography===\n\nAlmost 83% of the entire land area of the municipality are mountainous and hilly wherein 56% (43.65 square kilometers) of it is covered by thick forest and 44% or 34.30 square kilometers are planted with abaca, coconut, root crops and perennial trees. The lowland or plain area is about 17% of the total land are or 15.96 square kilometers which comprises the built-up areas, rice land, diversified agricultural lands and others. The mountainous area is located at the western part of the municipality and the hilly or rolling terrain lies eastward to the coastal areas, while the lowland or plain areas are situated along the coastal and river banks.\n\n===Geological features===\n\nThe structure of the earth's surface of the town is composed predominantly of upper Miocene-Pliocene (shale and sandstone sequence) located along the western and northern part of the municipality. Likewise Recent (Alluvium) layers is found along the coastal river bank areas and Cretaceous Paleocene (metamorphic rock) and Pliocene Pleistocene (conglomerate formation) are found at Late and Panay island.\n\n===Soil classification===\n\nThe municipal soil is composed of four (4) types, namely: Undifferential Mountain soil, Louisiana Clay, Hydrosol, Bantog Clay and traces of Beach Sand mostly along the coastal areas.\n\n===Climate===\n\nLike other municipalities of the eastern section of the province and province itself, the climate of the municipality is [[Climate of the Philippines|type II of the Coronas Classification]] for climatic zones, best described as having no distinct dry season with a very pronounced rainfall, usually heavy during the month from October to January. Typhoons are very much prevalent in this locality due to its geographical positioning fronting the Pacific Ocean.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Bagamanoc, Catanduanes\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 27\n| Jan low C  = 22\n| Feb high C = 27\n| Feb low C  = 22\n| Mar high C = 28\n| Mar low C  = 23\n| Apr high C = 30\n| Apr low C  = 24\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 25\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 25\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 28\n| Nov low C  = 24\n| Dec high C = 27\n| Dec low C  = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 138\n| Feb precipitation mm = 83\n| Mar precipitation mm = 74\n| Apr precipitation mm = 50\n| May precipitation mm = 108\n| Jun precipitation mm = 165\n| Jul precipitation mm = 202\n| Aug precipitation mm = 165\n| Sep precipitation mm = 190\n| Oct precipitation mm = 186\n| Nov precipitation mm = 188\n| Dec precipitation mm = 183\n| Jan rain days        = 16.8\n| Feb rain days        = 11.9\n| Mar rain days        = 13.5\n| Apr rain days        = 13.8\n| May rain days        = 20.5\n| Jun rain days        = 25.2\n| Jul rain days        = 27.4\n| Aug rain days        = 26.2\n| Sep rain days        = 26.1\n| Oct rain days        = 24.7\n| Nov rain days        = 20.7\n| Dec rain days        = 18.5\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/bagamanoc_philippines_1729195\n| title =  Bagamanoc, Catanduanes : Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 December 2018}}</ref>\n| date = 29 December 2018\n}}\n\n==Barangays==\nBagamanoc is politically subdivided into 18 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|- \n!Barangay\n!Population<br><small>(2010)</small>{{PH census|2010}}\n!Population<br><small>(2007)</small>\n!Change\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Antipolo\n|{{change|invert=on|839|785}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bacak\n|{{change|invert=on|476|423}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bagatabao\n|{{change|invert=on|738|710}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Bugao\n|{{change|invert=on|761|705}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Cahan\n|{{change|invert=on|241|254}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Hinipaan\n|{{change|invert=on|617|456}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Magsaysay\n|{{change|invert=on|715|616}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Poblacion\n|{{change|invert=on|931|779}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Quezon (''Pancayanan'')\n|{{change|invert=on|344|329}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Quigaray\n|{{change|invert=on|278|306}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Sagrada\n|{{change|invert=on|955|793}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Salvacion (''Panuto'')\n|{{change|invert=on|522|458}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Isidro\n|{{change|invert=on|834|760}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Rafael (''Mahantod'')\n|{{change|invert=on|547|458}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|San Vicente\n|{{change|invert=on|969|845}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Santa Mesa\n|{{change|invert=on|278|268}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Santa Teresa\n|{{change|invert=on|655|585}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left; font-weight:bold;\"|Suchan\n|{{change|invert=on|670|653}}\n|}\n\n==History==\n\nAt what is known as Bagatabao, but more island of the swamp, Bagamanocnons now called Taraga, there was already a chicken raising settlement place on the inhospitable plateau of Panay Island (Catanduanes).\n\nThe settlement was bounded on the east and north by the sea, blocked by a swamp and a hostile hill on the south and pressed by the crocodile-infested mouth of what is now known as the Bagamanoc River on the west. Confined to a limited territory by natural forces, the settlement could hardly feed and shelter itself. Moreover, frequent raids by corsairs from Mindanao, Jolo or Borneo for slaves posed a serious problem to their existence.\n\nOne day, a daring and adventurous young man from the tribe forced his way across the mouth of the river to look for rattan needed for the repair of his future bride's family house. Going westward by the shoreline, he finally turned left for the business of venture but before he cut an uphill distance, he saw what appeared to be a chicken flying along just above the tallest leaves of pandan shrubs festooning the sea. Back in his tribe, he told the clan on what he saw of the beauty of the place, its abundance with food and building materials and the defense is offered from the pirate's raid. But as the place has no name to say when referring to that \u201cdiscovered land\u201d every time anybody talk of the place, they would call it \u201cBAGAMANOC\u201d which means the place was like a \u201cchicken\u201d the very meaning of Bagamanoc.\n\nTo detect the coming of the Moro raids, the people erected a watchtower where the sea laps at the shore nearest the present Municipal Hall. In spite of the tower, many Bagamanocnons still fell into the corsairs\u2019 hand. When the Spaniards came, they found the place a thriving community. They converted the people into Christianity and made a settlement into a municipality under a governadorcillo. Under Spain, the town people constructed a concrete church and municipal hall of stones, limes, molasses and eggs. However, even under the Spaniard rule, Bagamanocnons did not fully submit to the Spanish dominion, although fully sold out to Christianity. During the revolution of 1898-1901, the Bagamanocnon relied their support to the Filipino Revolutionist. In fact, a bloody skirmish took place at Mapulang Labo, where then Apolonio Cueva skillfully beheaded an American Officer mounted on a horse. When the Americans reorganized the municipal government, the town was reduced to a mere town of Viga, later of Payo, until Bagamanoc became a municipality again in 1950.\n\nBagamanoc is used to be called a small town of big people and properly so. She had produced a hundred of professionals scattered all over the archipelago who in their modest way are making a name for themselves and for their birthplace. The country's representative to the \u201cTokyo Olympic Games\u201d in 1924. in the discus throwing event came from this town and the second Catanduanes congressman under an independent Philippines hails from here. As of lately and during the time where the American Bases are still here in the Philippines,Bagamanoc has also been the site of the LORAN ( Long Range Navigation Facilities ) Station primarily installed to protect the country from external threats, among others.\n\nBagamanoc was created from barrios of Quigaray, Hinipagan, Sukhan in the island of Panay; Lati, in the island of Lati; Bacac, Hinipaan, Bugao, Minaili and Bagamanoc of the municipality of [[Panganiban, Catanduanes|Panganiban]] by virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 491 which was approved on June 12, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra491.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711025131/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra491.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=An act creating the municipality of Bagamanoc in the province of Catanduanes |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe municipal councils of Bagamanoc and Panganiban agreed on the boundary of the two towns on June 12, 1952.
