Some [[semiconductor]] fabrication processes use its oxide for [[integrated circuit]]s at 45&nbsp;nm and smaller feature lengths. Some [[superalloy]]s used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with [[niobium]], [[titanium]], or [[tungsten]].\n\nHafnium's large [[neutron capture]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] makes it a good material for [[neutron]] absorption in [[control rod]]s in [[nuclear power plant]]s, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant [[zirconium alloy]]s used in [[nuclear reactor]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical characteristics===\n[[File:Hafnium bits.jpg|thumb|left|Pieces of hafnium]]\nHafnium is a shiny, silvery, [[ductility|ductile]] [[metal]] that is [[corrosion]]-resistant and chemically similar to zirconium<ref name=\"ASTM\"/> (due to its having the same number of [[valence electron]]s, being in the same group, but also to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]]; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the [[lanthanide contraction]]). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.<ref name=\"ASTM\"/>\n\nA notable physical difference between these metals is their [[density]], with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron capture cross section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more [[neutron]]s apiece.<ref name=\"ASTM\"/> In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors \u2013 especially the cladding of their [[nuclear fuel rod]]s.\n\n===Chemical characteristics===\n{{Category see also|Hafnium compounds}}\n[[File:Hafnium(IV) oxide.jpg|thumb|left|Hafnium dioxide]]\nHafnium reacts in air to form a [[Passivation (chemistry)|protective film]] that inhibits further [[corrosion]].  The metal is not readily attacked by acids but can be oxidized with [[halogen]]s or it can be burnt in air.  Like its sister metal zirconium, finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air. The metal is resistant to concentrated [[alkali]]s.\n\nThe chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated on the basis of differing chemical reactions.

Zircon also has an extremely low Lu/Hf ratio, making any correction for initial lutetium minimal. Although the Lu/Hf system can be used to calculate a \"[[Nd model ages|model age]]\", i.e. the time at which it was derived from a given isotopic reservoir such as the [[depleted-mantle model|depleted mantle]], these \"ages\" do not carry the same geologic significance as do other geochronological techniques as the results often yield isotopic mixtures and thus provide an average age of the material from which it was derived.\n\n[[Garnet]] is another mineral that contains appreciable amounts of hafnium to act as a geochronometer. The high and variable Lu/Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] events.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Albar\u00e8de|first1=F.|last2=Duch\u00eane|first2=S.|last3=Blichert-Toft|first3=J.|last4=Luais|first4=B.|last5=T\u00e9louk|first5=P.|last6=Lardeaux|first6=J.-M.|journal=Nature|title=The Lu\u2013Hf dating of garnets and the ages of the Alpine high-pressure metamorphism|date=5 June 1997|volume=387|issue=6633|pages=586\u2013589|doi=10.1038/42446|bibcode=1997Natur.387..586D}}</ref>\n\n===Other uses===\nDue to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and [[incandescent lamp]]s.

A pioneer in the field of [[quantum optics]], Stroud has carried out theoretical and experimental studies in most areas of the field from its beginnings in the late 1960s, studying the fundamentals of the quantum mechanics of atoms and light and their interaction. He has authored over 140 peer-reviewed papers and edited seven books. He is a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[Optical Society of America]], as well as a Distinguished Traveling Lecturer of the Division of Laser Science of the American Physical Society. In this latter position he travels to smaller colleges giving colloquia and public lectures.\n\n==Life and career ==\n\nCarlos Stroud grew up in [[Kentucky]] and graduated from [[Centre College]] in 1963, with degrees in mathematics and physics. In 1969 he earned a Ph.D. in physics from [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], under the mentorship of [[E. T. Jaynes]], with the thesis titled Quantum and Semiclassical Radiation Theory. In 1969 Stroud joined the faculty of The Institute of Optics at the [[University of Rochester]]. Over his 50-year career at the University of Rochester, Professor Stroud taught undergraduate and graduate courses in general and quantum physics and optics, while conducting groundbreaking research in several areas of quantum optics, graduating 30 Ph.D.s. He was named Professor of Optics in 1984 and Professor of Physics and Astronomy in 1991.\n\nIn 2004, Stroud collected and edited ''A Jewel in the Crown: Essays in Honor of the 75th Anniversary of the Institute of Optics'', a compilation of 75 essays on the history of the University of Rochester's Institute of Optics (19 of the essays were authored or co-authored by Stroud himself).\u00a0In 2019, Stroud and Gina Kern co-edited ''A Jewel in the Crown II: Essays in Honor of the 90th Anniversary of the Institute of Optics''.\u00a0For his contributions in gathering and documenting the Institute of Optics' history, on his retirement on July 1, 2019, Stroud was named Professor Emeritus of Optics and Optics Historian.\n\n==Professional contributions==\n\nSoon after joining the faculty of the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester, Stroud collaborated with Michael Hercher, developing the first single-mode tunable [[dye laser]] and using it to study its interaction with sodium atoms in an atomic beam. This work produced a series of groundbreaking experiments, including the study of the [[hyperfine structure]] of the D-lines, the isolation of a closed two-level resonance, power broadening, and [[resonance fluorescence]] in this system. This first observation of the Mollow sidebands in resonance fluorescence was fundamental to understanding of the nature of quantum correlations in a coherently pumped [[Two-state quantum system|two-level system]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schuda|first=F|last2=Stroud|first2=C R|last3=Hercher|first3=M|date=1974-05-11|title=Observation of the resonant Stark effect at optical frequencies|journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic and Molecular Physics|volume=7|issue=7|pages=L198\u2013L202|doi=10.1088/0022-3700/7/7/002|issn=0022-3700|bibcode=1974JPhB....7L.198S}}</ref> It is noteworthy that groups at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and the [[Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics|Max Planck Institute in Garching]] were also racing to be first to observe this spectrum, and did indeed confirm the initial results.\n\nThese experimental observations were soon followed by two-laser studies of three-level quantum systems.\u00a0The first cw study of the [[Autler\u2013Townes effect]], and the first experimental study of the extremely sharp resonance associated with coherent population trapping were made.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=H.

A pioneer in the field of [[quantum optics]], Stroud has carried out theoretical and experimental studies in most areas of the field from its beginnings in the late 1960s, studying the fundamentals of the quantum mechanics of atoms and light and their interaction. He has authored over 140 peer-reviewed papers and edited seven books. He is a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[Optical Society of America]], as well as a Distinguished Traveling Lecturer of the Division of Laser Science of the American Physical Society. In this latter position he travels to smaller colleges giving colloquia and public lectures.\n\n==Life and career ==\n\nCarlos Stroud grew up in [[Kentucky]] and graduated from [[Centre College]] in 1963, with degrees in mathematics and physics. In 1969 he earned a Ph.D. in physics from [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], under the mentorship of [[E. T. Jaynes]], with the thesis titled Quantum and Semiclassical Radiation Theory. In 1969 Stroud joined the faculty of The Institute of Optics at the [[University of Rochester]]. Over his 50-year career at the University of Rochester, Professor Stroud taught undergraduate and graduate courses in general and quantum physics and optics, while conducting groundbreaking research in several areas of quantum optics, graduating 30 Ph.D.s. He was named Professor of Optics in 1984 and Professor of Physics and Astronomy in 1991.\n\nIn 2004, Stroud collected and edited ''A Jewel in the Crown: Essays in Honor of the 75th Anniversary of the Institute of Optics'', a compilation of 75 essays on the history of the University of Rochester's Institute of Optics (19 of the essays were authored or co-authored by Stroud himself).\u00a0In 2019, Stroud and Gina Kern co-edited ''A Jewel in the Crown II: Essays in Honor of the 90th Anniversary of the Institute of Optics''.\u00a0For his contributions in gathering and documenting the Institute of Optics' history, on his retirement on July 1, 2019, Stroud was named Professor Emeritus of Optics and Optics Historian.\n\n==Professional contributions==\n\nSoon after joining the faculty of the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester, Stroud collaborated with Michael Hercher, developing the first single-mode tunable [[dye laser]] and using it to study its interaction with sodium atoms in an atomic beam. This work produced a series of groundbreaking experiments, including the study of the [[hyperfine structure]] of the D-lines, the isolation of a closed two-level resonance, power broadening, and [[resonance fluorescence]] in this system. This first observation of the Mollow sidebands in resonance fluorescence was fundamental to understanding of the nature of quantum correlations in a coherently pumped [[Two-state quantum system|two-level system]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schuda|first=F|last2=Stroud|first2=C R|last3=Hercher|first3=M|date=1974-05-11|title=Observation of the resonant Stark effect at optical frequencies|journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic and Molecular Physics|volume=7|issue=7|pages=L198\u2013L202|doi=10.1088/0022-3700/7/7/002|issn=0022-3700|bibcode=1974JPhB....7L.198S}}</ref> It is noteworthy that groups at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and the [[Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics|Max Planck Institute in Garching]] were also racing to be first to observe this spectrum, and did indeed confirm the initial results.\n\nThese experimental observations were soon followed by two-laser studies of three-level quantum systems.\u00a0The first cw study of the [[Autler\u2013Townes effect]], and the first experimental study of the extremely sharp resonance associated with coherent population trapping were made.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=H.

Through their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to Northwest Africa and Europe, where it was adopted by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. Later, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] adopted a modified version for their own use, which, in turn, was modified and adopted by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and became the Latin alphabet.<ref>Edward Clodd, ''Story of the Alphabet'' (Kessinger) 2003:192ff</ref>\n\nPunic colonisation spread Phoenician to the western Mediterranean, where the distinct [[Punic language]] developed.

The Punic form of the script gradually developed somewhat different and more cursive letter shapes; in the 3rd century BC, it also began to exhibit a tendency to mark the presence of vowels, especially final vowels, with an [[aleph]] or sometimes an [[ayin]]. Furthermore, around the time of the [[Second Punic War]], an even more cursive form began to develop,<ref>Jongeling, K. and Robert Kerr. Late Punic epigraphy.

Personal Names in the Phoenician and Punic Inscriptions. P.12-14</ref> Neo-Punic, in turn, tended to designate vowels with [[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (\"consonantal letters\") more frequently than the previous systems had and also began to systematically use different letters for different vowels,<ref name=benz/> in the way explained in more detail below. Finally, a number of late inscriptions from what is now [[Constantine, Algeria]] dated to the first century BC make use of the Greek alphabet to write Punic, and many inscriptions from [[Tripolitania]], in the third and fourth centuries AD use the Latin alphabet for that purpose.<ref>Jongeling, K. and Robert Kerr. Late Punic epigraphy. P.2.</ref>\n\nIn Phoenician writing, unlike that of abjads such as those of Aramaic, Biblical Hebrew and Arabic, even long vowels remained generally unexpressed, regardless of their origin (even if they originated from diphthongs, as in '''bt''' {{IPA|/be\u02d0t/}} 'house'; Hebrew spelling has '''byt'''). Eventually, Punic writers began to implement systems of marking of vowels by means of ''matres lectionis''. In the 3rd century BC appeared the practice of using final [[aleph|'\u0101lep]] [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] to mark the presence of any final vowel and, occasionally, of [[yodh|y\u014dd]] [[File:Phoenician_yodh.svg|10px]] to mark a final long {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}.\n\nLater, mostly after the destruction of Carthage in the so-called \"Neo-Punic\" inscriptions, that was supplemented by a system in which [[Waw (letter)|w\u0101w]] [[File:Phoenician waw.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[u]}}, y\u014dd [[File:Phoenician_yodh.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[i]}}, '\u0101lep [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}, [[ayin|\u02bfayin]] [[File:Phoenician_ayin.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[a]}}{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=85}} and [[he (letter)|h\u0113]] [[File:Phoenician_he.svg|10px]] and [[Heth|{{transl|sem|\u1e25\u0113t}}]] [[File:phoenician heth.png|10px]] could also be used to signify {{IPA|[a]}}.<ref>Jongeling, K., Robert M. Kerr. 2005. Late Punic epigraphy: an introduction to the study of Neo-Punic and Latino-Punic Inscriptions</ref> This latter system was used first with foreign words and was then extended to many native words as well.\n\nA third practice reported in the literature is the use of the consonantal letters for vowels in the same way as had occurred in the original adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet to Greek and Latin, which was apparently still transparent to Punic writers: h\u0113 [[File:Phoenician_he.svg|10px]] for {{IPA|[e]}} and '\u0101lep [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] for {{IPA|[a]}}.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=175}}\n\nLater, Punic inscriptions began to be written in the Latin alphabet, which also indicated the vowels.

Recent scholarship argues that {{transl|sem|\u0161}} was {{IPA|[s]}}, {{transl|sem|s}} was {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{transl|sem|z}} was {{IPA|[dz]}}, and {{transl|sem|\u1e63}} was {{IPA|[ts\u02bc]}},{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=86}} against the traditional sound values of {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}, and {{IPA|[s\u02e4]}} as reflected in the transcription.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=59}}\n\nOn the other hand, it is debated whether [[shin (letter)|\u0161\u012bn]] [[File:Phoenician_sin.svg|10px]] and [[samekh|s\u0101mek]] [[File:Phoenician_samekh.svg|10px]], which are mostly well distinguished by the Phoenician orthography, also eventually merged at some point, either in Classical Phoenician or in Late Punic.<ref>Kerr, Robert M. 2010.

Neither these nor the emphatics could be adequately represented by the Latin alphabet, but there is also evidence to that effect from Punic script transcriptions.\n\n==== Lenition ====\nThere is no consensus on whether Phoenician-Punic ever underwent the [[lenition]] of [[stop consonant]]s that happened in most other Northwest Semitic languages such as Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (cf.

During most of its existence, Phoenician writing showed no vowels at all, and even as vowel notation systems did eventually arise late in its history, they never came to be applied consistently to native vocabulary. It is thought that Phoenician had the short vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and the long vowels {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=87}}{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=60}} The Proto-Semitic diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} are realized as {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}. That must have happened earlier than in Biblical Hebrew since the resultant long vowels are not marked with the semivowel letters (''b\u0113t'' \"house\" was written {{Script|Phnx|\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd15}} '''bt''', in contrast to Biblical Hebrew {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea}} '''byt''').\n\nThe most conspicuous vocalic development in Phoenician is the so-called [[Canaanite shift]], partly shared by Biblical Hebrew, but going further in Phoenician. The Proto-Northwest Semitic {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} became not merely {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} as in [[Tiberian Hebrew]], but {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Stressed Proto-Semitic {{IPA|/a/}} became Tiberian Hebrew {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} ({{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} in other traditions), but Phoenician {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}. The shift is proved by Latin and Greek transcriptions like ''r\u016bs'' for \"head, cape\" (Tiberian Hebrew ''r\u014d\u0161'', {{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9}}), ''sam\u014d'' for \"he heard\" (Tiberian Hebrew ''\u0161\u0101m\u0101\u02bb'', {{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05de\u05e2}}); similarly the word for \"eternity\" is known from Greek transcriptions to have been ''\u02bb\u016bl\u014dm'', corresponding to Biblical Hebrew ''\u02bb\u014dl\u0101m'' and Proto-Semitic ''\u02bb\u0101lam''. The letter Y used for words such as ''ys'' \"which\" and ''yth'' (definite accusative marker) in Greek and Latin alphabet inscriptions can be interpreted as denoting a reduced [[schwa]] vowel{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=175}} that occurred in pre-stress syllables in verbs and two syllables before stress in nouns and adjectives,{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}} while other instances of Y as in ''chyl'' and even ''chil'' for /kull/ \"all\" in ''[[Poenulus]]'' can be interpreted as a further stage in the vowel shift resulting in fronting ({{IPA|[y]}}) and even subsequent delabialization of {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}}{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=61}} Short {{IPA|/*i/}} in originally-open syllables was lowered to {{IPA|[e]}} and was also lengthened if it was accented.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}}\n\n===Suprasegmentals===\n\nStress-dependent vowel changes indicate that stress was probably mostly final, as in Biblical Hebrew.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=89}} Long vowels probably occurred only in open syllables.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=63}}\n\n==Grammar==\nAs is typical for the Semitic languages, Phoenician words are usually built around consonantal roots and vowel changes are used extensively to express [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] distinctions. However, unlike most Semitic languages, Phoenician preserved numerous uniconsonantal and biconsonantal roots inherited from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afro-Asiatic]]: compare the verbs '''kn''' \"to be\" vs Arabic '''kwn''', '''mt''' \"to die\" vs Hebrew and Arabic '''mwt''' and '''sr''' \"to remove\" vs Hebrew '''srr'''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=i08KAQAAMAAJ&q=|title=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft|last=Stade|first=Bernhard|last2=Marti|first2=Karl|date=1970|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=|location=|pages=272|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===No<span class=\"ve-ce-branchNode-slug ve-ce-branchNode-inlineSlug\"></span>minal morphology===\nNouns are marked for gender (masculine and feminine), number (singular, plural and vestiges of the dual) and state (absolute and construct, the latter being nouns that are followed by their possessors) and also have the category definiteness. There is some evidence for remains of the Proto-Semitic genitive [[grammatical case]] as well. While many of the endings coalesce in the standard orthography, inscriptions in the Latin and Greek alphabet permit the reconstruction of the noun endings, which are also the adjective endings, as follows:<ref>Segert, Stanislav. 2007.

However, evidence has been found for a retention of the genitive case in the form of the first-singular possessive suffix: '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcby}}''' /{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}abiya/ \"of my father\" vs '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcb}}''' /{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}ab\u012b/ \"my father\". If true, this may suggest that cases were still distinguished to some degree in other forms as well.\n\nThe written forms and the reconstructed pronunciations of the personal pronouns are as follows:{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=85|loc=The description of the pronouns follows Hackett}}\n\nSingular: <br>\n1st: /{{transl|sem|\u02bcan\u014dk\u012b}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcnk}}''' (Punic sometimes '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcnky}}'''), also attested as /{{transl|sem|\u02bcanek}}/<br>\n2nd masc. /{{transl|sem|\u02bcatta(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bct}}'''<br>\n2nd fem. /{{transl|sem|\u02bcatti(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bct}}'''<br>\n3rd masc. /{{transl|sem|hu\u02bc}}/ '''{{transl|sem|h\u02bc}}''', also [{{transl|sem|hy}}] (?)

They appear in a slightly different form depending on whether or not they follow plural-form masculine nouns (and so are added after a vowel). The former is given in brackets with the abbreviation a.V.\n\nSingular: <br>\n1st: /{{transl|sem|-\u012b}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u2205}}''', also '''{{transl|sem|y}}''' (a.V. /{{transl|sem|-ayy}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''') <br>\n2nd masc. /{{transl|sem|-ka(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|k}}'''<br>\n2nd fem. /{{transl|sem|-ki(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|k}}'''<br>\n3rd masc. /{{transl|sem|-o\u02d0}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u2205}}''', Punic {{transl|sem|\u02bc}}, (a.V. /{{transl|sem|-\u0113yu(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''') <br>\n3rd fem. /{{transl|sem|-a\u02d0}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u2205}}''', Punic {{transl|sem|\u02bc}} (a.V. /{{transl|sem|-\u0113ya(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''')\n\nPlural: <br>\n1st: /{{transl|sem|-o(\u02d0)n}}/ '''{{transl|sem|n}}'''<br>\n2nd masc. unattested<br>\n2nd fem. unattested<br>\n3rd masc. /{{transl|sem|-o(\u02d0)m}}/ '''{{transl|sem|m}}''' (a.V. /{{transl|sem|-n\u014dm}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}''') <br>\n3rd fem. /{{transl|sem|-e(\u02d0)m}}/ '''{{transl|sem|m}}''' (a.V. /{{transl|sem|-n\u0113m}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}''')\n\nIn addition, according to some research, the same written forms of the enclitics that are attested after vowels are also found after a singular noun in what must have been the genitive case (which ended in {{IPA|/-i/}}, whereas the plural version ended in {{IPA|/-\u0113/}}). Their pronunciation can then be reconstructed somewhat differently: first-person singular /{{transl|sem|-iya(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''', third-person singular masculine and feminine /{{transl|sem|-iyu(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''' and /{{transl|sem|-iya(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}'''. The third-person plural singular and feminine must have pronounced the same in both cases, i.e. /{{transl|sem|-n\u014dm}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}''' and /{{transl|sem|-n\u0113m}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}'''.\n\nThese enclitic forms vary between the dialects. In the archaic [[Byblos|Byblian]] dialect, the third person forms are '''h''' and '''w''' /{{transl|sem|-\u014d}}/ for the masculine singular (a.V. '''w''' /{{transl|sem|-\u0113w}}/), '''h''' /{{transl|sem|-aha(\u02d0)}}/ for the feminine singular and '''hm''' /{{transl|sem|-hum(ma)}}/ for the masculine plural. In late Punic, the 3rd masculine singular is usually /{{transl|sem|-im}}/ '''{{transl|sem|m}}'''.\n\nThe same enclitic pronouns are also attached to verbs to denote direct objects. In that function, some of them have slightly divergent forms: first singular /{{transl|sem|-n\u012b}}/ '''{{transl|sem|n}}''' and probably first plural /{{transl|sem|-nu(\u02d0)}}/.\n\nThe near demonstrative pronouns (\"this\") are written, in standard Phoenician, '''z''' for the singular and '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcl}}''' for the plural. Cypriot Phoenician displays '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcz}}''' instead of '''z'''. Byblian still distinguishes, in the singular, a masculine '''{{transl|sem|zn}}''' / '''{{transl|sem|z}}''' from a feminine '''{{transl|sem|zt}}''' / '''{{transl|sem|z\u02bc}}'''. There are also many variations in Punic, including '''st''' and '''zt''' for both genders in the singular. The far demonstrative pronouns (\"that\") are identical to the independent third-person pronouns. The interrogative pronouns are {{IPA|/miya/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/mi/}} '''{{transl|sem|my}}''' \"who\" and {{IPA|/m\u016b/}} '''{{transl|sem|m}}''' \"what\". An indefinite pronoun \"anything\" is written '''mnm'''. The relative pronoun is a '''{{transl|sem|\u0161}}''', either followed or preceded by a vowel.\n\nThe definite article was {{IPA|/ha-/}}, and the first consonant of the following word was doubled. It was written '''h''' but in late Punic also '''{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}''' and '''{{transl|sem|\u02bb}}''' because of the weakening and coalescence of the gutturals. Much as in Biblical Hebrew, the initial consonant of the article is dropped after the prepositions '''b-''', '''l-''' and '''k'''; it could also be lost after various other particles and function words, such the direct object marker '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcyt}}''' and the conjunction '''w-''' \"and\".\n\nOf the cardinal numerals from 1 to 10, 1 is an adjective, 2 is formally a noun in the dual and the rest are nouns in the singular.

The old Semitic jussive, which originally differed slightly from the prefix conjugation, is no longer possible to separate from it in Phoenician with the present data.\n\nThe non-finite forms are the infinitive construct, the infinitive absolute and the active and passive participles. In the G-stem, the infinitive construct is usually combined with the preposition '''l-''' \"to\", as in {{transl|sem|/liqtul/}} \"to kill\"; in contrast, the infinitive absolute (qat\u014dl){{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=96}} is mostly used to strengthen the meaning of a subsequent finite verb with the same root: {{transl|sem|'''pt\u1e25 tpt\u1e25 '''}} \"you will indeed open!\",<ref name=segert82/> accordingly /{{transl|sem|*qat\u014dl tiqtul}}/ \"you will indeed kill!\".\n\nThe participles had, in the G-stem, the following forms: <br>\nActive: <br>\nMasculine singular /{{transl|sem|q\u016btel}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|q\u014dtil}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qotlim}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|q\u014dtil\u012bm}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}<br>\nFeminine singular {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}, plural *{{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}<br>\nPassive: <br>\nMasculine singular /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|qat\u012bl}}/<ref name=lyavd293/> {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl\u012bm}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtlm'''}}<br>\nFeminine singular {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl\u014dt}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}\n\nThe missing forms above can be inferred from the correspondences between the Proto-Northwest Semitic ancestral forms and the attested Phoenician counterparts: the PNWS participle forms are *{{transl|sem|/q\u0101til-, q\u0101til\u012bma, q\u0101til(a)t, q\u0101til\u0101t, qat\u016bl, qat\u016bl\u012bm, qatult or qat\u016blat, qat\u016bl\u0101t/}}.\n\nThe derived stems are:\n* the N-stem (functioning as a passive), e.g. '''nqtl''', the N-formant being lost in the prefix conjugation while assimilating and doubling the first root consonant ('''yqtl''').\n* the D-stem (functioning as a factitive): the forms must have been /qittil/ in the suffix conjugation, /yaqattil/ in the prefix conjugation, /qattil/ in the imperative and the infinitive construct, /qatt\u014dl/ in the infinitive absolute and /maqattil/ in the participle. The characteristic doubling of the middle consonant is only identifiable in foreign alphabet transcriptions.\n* the C-stem (functioning as a causative): the original *ha- prefix has produced *yi- rather than the Hebrew *hi-. The forms were apparently /yiqtil/ in the suffix conjugation ({{transl|sem|/\u02bciqtil}}/ in late Punic), /yaqtil/ in the prefix conjugation, and the infinitive is also /yaqtil/, while the participle was probably /maqtil/ or, in late Punic at least, /miqtil/.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=97}}\n\nMost of the stems apparently also had passive and reflexive counterparts, the former differing through vowels, the latter also through the infix '''-t-'''. The G stem passive is attested as '''qytl''', {{transl|sem|/qytal/}} < *{{transl|sem|/qutal/}}.;<ref name=segert82/> t-stems can be reconstructed as /yitqatil/ '''ytqtl''' (tG) and /yiqtattil/ (Dt) '''yqttl'''.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=99}}\n\n===Prepositions and particles===\nSome prepositions are always prefixed to nouns, deleting, if present, the initial {{IPA|/h/}} of the definite article: such are '''b-''' \"in\", '''l-''' \"to, for\", '''k-''' \"as\" and '''m-''' /{{transl|sem|min}}/ \"from\". They are sometimes found in forms extended through the addition of '''-n''' or '''-t'''. Other prepositions are not like that:{{transl|sem|'''\u02bbl'''}} \"upon\", .{{transl|sem|'''\u02bbd'''}} \"until\", {{transl|sem|'''\u02bc\u1e25r'''}} \"after\", {{transl|sem|'''t\u1e25t'''}} \"under\", {{transl|sem|'''b(y)n'''}} \"between\". New prepositions are formed with nouns: '''lpn''' \"in front of\", from '''l-''' \"to\" and '''pn''' \"face\". There is a special preposited marker of a definite object {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcyt'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bciyy\u016bt}}/?), which, unlike Hebrew, is clearly distinct from the preposition {{transl|sem|'''\u02bct'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bcitt}}/).\n\nThe most common negative marker is {{transl|sem|'''bl'''}} (/{{transl|sem|bal}}/), negating verbs but sometimes also nouns; another one is {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcy'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bc\u012b}}/), expressing both nonexistence and the negation of verbs. Negative commands or prohibitions are expressed with {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcl'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bcal}}/). \"Lest\" is {{transl|sem|'''lm'''}}. Some common conjunctions are {{transl|sem|'''w'''}} (originally perhaps /{{transl|sem|wa-?}}/, but certainly /{{transl|sem|u-}}/ in Late Punic), \"and\" {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcm'''}} ({{transl|sem|/\u02bcim/}}), \"when\", and {{transl|sem|'''k'''}} ({{transl|sem|/k\u012b/}}), \"that; because; when\". There was also a conjunction {{transl|sem|('''\u02bc''')'''p'''}} ({{transl|sem|/\u02bcap/}}\"also\". {{transl|sem|'''l-'''}} (/{{transl|sem|l\u016b, li}}/) could (rarely) be used to introduce desiderative constructions (\"may he do X!\"). {{transl|sem|'''l-'''}} could also introduce vocatives. Both prepositions and conjunctions could form compounds.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=98}}\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order is [[verb-subject-object]]. There is no verb \"to be\" in the present tense; in clauses that would have used a copula, the subject may come before the predicate. Nouns precede their modifiers, such as adjectives and possessors.\n\n==Vocabulary and word formation==\nMost nouns are formed by a combination of consonantal roots and vocalic patterns, but they can formed also with prefixes ({{IPA|/m-/}}, expressing actions or their results, and rarely {{IPA|/t-/}}) and suffixes {{IPA|/-\u016bn/}}. Abstracts can be formed with the suffix '''-t''' (probably {{IPA|/-\u012bt/}}, {{IPA|/-\u016bt/}}).<ref name=lyavd293>\u041b\u044f\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410.\u041a. 2009. \u0424\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430: \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0410.\u0413. \u0438 \u0434\u0440.

The Punic throughout its existence co-existed with the [[Berber language]] which is native to [[Tunisia]] (Including Carthage) and North Africa. Punic disappeared some time after the destruction of Carthage by the Romans and the Berbers. It is possible that Punic may have survived the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in some small isolated area: the geographer [[al-Bakri]] describes a people speaking a language that was not [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Latin]] or [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in the city of [[Sirte]] in rural [[Ifriqiya]], a region in which spoken Punic survived well past its written use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/vtw/jongeling/latpun/LPINTRO.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-25 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109091842/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/vtw/jongeling/LATPUN/LPINTRO.htm |archivedate=2005-11-09 |df= }}</ref> However, it is likely that arabization of the Punics was facilitated by their language belonging to the same group (both being [[Semitic languages]]) as that of the conquerors and thus having many grammatical and lexical similarities. Most Punic speakers may have been linguistically Berberized and/or Latinized after the fall of Carthage.\n\nThe ancient Libyco-Berber alphabet that is still in irregular use by modern Berber groups such as the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] is known by the native name [[Tifinagh]], possibly a derived form of a cognate of the name \"Punic\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Still, a direct derivation from the Phoenician-Punic script is debated and far from established since the two writing systems are very different. As far as language (not the script) is concerned, some borrowings from Punic appear in modern Berber dialects: one interesting example is ''agadir'' \"wall\" from Punic ''gader''.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting case of Punic influence is that of the name of [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], comprising [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), which, according to one of the theories, is derived from the Punic ''I-Shaphan'' meaning \"coast of [[hyrax]]es\", in turn a misidentification on the part of Phoenician explorers of its numerous [[rabbit]]s as hyraxes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Another case is the name of a tribe of hostile \"hairy people\" that [[Hanno the Navigator]] found in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The name given to those people by [[Hanno the Navigator]]'s interpreters was transmitted from Punic into Greek as ''gorillai'' and was applied in 1847 by [[Thomas S. Savage]] to the [[western gorilla]].\n\n==Surviving examples==\nPhoenician, together with Punic, is primarily known from approximately 10,000 surviving inscriptions,{{sfn|Lehmann|2013|p=209|ps=:Nearly two hundred years later the repertory of Phoenician-Punic epigraphy counts about 10.000 inscriptions from throughout the Mediterranean and its environs. Nevertheless, almost 150 years after Gesenius, Wolfgang R\u00f6llig bewailed once more that \"notwithstanding the welcome increase of textual material in the past decades, Phoenician probably remains the worst transmitted and least known of all Semitic languages.}} supplemented by occasional glosses in books written in other languages. In addition to their many inscriptions, the Phoenicians are believed to have left numerous other types of written sources, but most have not survived.{{quote|The Phoenician alphabetic script was easy to write on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] sheets, and the use of these materials explains why virtually no Phoenician writings \u2013 no history, no trading records \u2013 have come down to us. In their cities by the sea, the air and soil were damp, and papyrus and leather moldered and rotted away. Thus disappeared the literature of the people who taught a large portion of the earth's population to write. The only written documents of Phoenicians and [[Carthaginians]] are monumental inscriptions on stone, a few ephemeral letters or notes on pieces of broken pottery, and three fragmentary papyri. Thus, no Tyrian primary sources dating from [[Hiram I]]'s time are available.<ref>Lipi\u0144ski (1995), p.1321-1322</ref>}}\n\nRoman authors, such as [[Sallust]], allude to some books written in the [[Punic language]], but none have survived except occasionally in translation (e.g., Mago's treatise) or in snippets (e.g., in [[Plautus]]' plays). The [[Cippi of Melqart]], a [[bilingual inscription]] in Ancient Greek and Carthaginian discovered in [[Malta]] in 1694, was the key which allowed French scholar [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy]] to decipher and reconstruct the alphabet in 1758.{{sfn|Lehmann|2013}} Even as late as 1837 only 70 Phoenician inscriptions were known to scholars. These were compiled in [[Wilhelm Gesenius]]'s ''Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae monumenta'', which comprised all that was known of Phoenician by scholars at that time.{{quote|Basically, its core consists of the comprehensive edition, or re-edition of 70 Phoenician and some more non-Phoenician inscriptions... However, just to note the advances made in the nineteenth century, it is noteworthy that Gesenius\u2019 precursor Hamaker, in his Miscellanea Phoenicia of 1828, had only 13 inscriptions at his disposal. On the other hand only 30 years later the amount of Phoenician inscribed monuments had grown so enormously that Schr\u00f6der in his compendium ''Die ph\u00f6nizische Sprache. Entwurf einer Grammatik nebst Sprach- und Schriftproben'' of 1869 could state that Gesenius knew only a quarter of the material Schr\u00f6der had at hand himself.{{sfn|Lehmann|2013|p=240}}|sign=|source=}}\nSome key surviving inscriptions of Phoenician are:\n\n*[[Ahiram sarcophagus]]\n*[[Bodashtart]]\n*[[\u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription]]\n*[[Cippi of Melqart]]\n*[[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]]\n*[[Karatepe]]\n*[[Kilamuwa Stela]]\n*[[Nora Stone]]\n*[[Pyrgi Tablets]]\n*[[Temple of Eshmun]]\n\nSince [[Pyrgi Tablets|bilingual tablets]] with inscriptions in both [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and Phoenician dating from around 500 BC were found in 1964, more Etruscan has been deciphered through comparison to the more fully understood Phoenician.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Punic language]]\n*[[Phoenician alphabet]]\n*[[Emerald Tablet]]\n*[[Extinct language]]\n*[[List of extinct languages of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{NIE Poster|Ph\u0153nician Language}}\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Phoenician language\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n*Fox, Joshua. \"A Sequence of Vowel Shifts in Phoenician and Other Languages.\" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 55, no. 1 (1996): 37-47. https://www.jstor.org/stable/545378.\n* {{cite book |last=Hackett |first=Joe Ann |year=2008 |chapter=Phoenician and Punic |title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia |editor-first=Roger D. |editor-last=Woodard |url=https://e-learning.tsu.ge/pluginfile.php/5868/mod_resource/content/0/dzveli_armosavluri_enebi_-ugarituli_punikuri_arameuli_ebrauli_arabuli.pdf |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9780511486890 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511486890 |chapter-url=https://e-learning.tsu.ge/pluginfile.php/5868/mod_resource/content/0/dzveli_armosavluri_enebi_-ugarituli_punikuri_arameuli_ebrauli_arabuli.pdf#page=104 |ref=harv}}\n*Holmstedt, Robert D., and Aaron Schade.

Through their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to Northwest Africa and Europe, where it was adopted by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. Later, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] adopted a modified version for their own use, which, in turn, was modified and adopted by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and became the Latin alphabet.<ref>Edward Clodd, ''Story of the Alphabet'' (Kessinger) 2003:192ff</ref>\n\nPunic colonisation spread Phoenician to the western Mediterranean, where the distinct [[Punic language]] developed.

The Punic form of the script gradually developed somewhat different and more cursive letter shapes; in the 3rd century BC, it also began to exhibit a tendency to mark the presence of vowels, especially final vowels, with an [[aleph]] or sometimes an [[ayin]]. Furthermore, around the time of the [[Second Punic War]], an even more cursive form began to develop,<ref>Jongeling, K. and Robert Kerr. Late Punic epigraphy. P.10.</ref> which gave rise to a variety referred to as Neo-Punic and existed alongside the more conservative form and became predominant some time after the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|destruction of Carthage (c. 149 BC)]].<ref name=benz>Benz, Franz L. 1982. Personal Names in the Phoenician and Punic Inscriptions. P.12-14</ref> Neo-Punic, in turn, tended to designate vowels with [[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (\"consonantal letters\") more frequently than the previous systems had and also began to systematically use different letters for different vowels,<ref name=benz/> in the way explained in more detail below. Finally, a number of late inscriptions from what is now [[Constantine, Algeria]] dated to the first century BC make use of the Greek alphabet to write Punic, and many inscriptions from [[Tripolitania]], in the third and fourth centuries AD use the Latin alphabet for that purpose.<ref>Jongeling, K. and Robert Kerr. Late Punic epigraphy. P.2.</ref>\n\nIn Phoenician writing, unlike that of abjads such as those of Aramaic, Biblical Hebrew and Arabic, even long vowels remained generally unexpressed, regardless of their origin (even if they originated from diphthongs, as in '''bt''' {{IPA|/be\u02d0t/}} 'house'; Hebrew spelling has '''byt'''). Eventually, Punic writers began to implement systems of marking of vowels by means of ''matres lectionis''. In the 3rd century BC appeared the practice of using final [[aleph|'\u0101lep]] [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] to mark the presence of any final vowel and, occasionally, of [[yodh|y\u014dd]] [[File:Phoenician_yodh.svg|10px]] to mark a final long {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}.\n\nLater, mostly after the destruction of Carthage in the so-called \"Neo-Punic\" inscriptions, that was supplemented by a system in which [[Waw (letter)|w\u0101w]] [[File:Phoenician waw.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[u]}}, y\u014dd [[File:Phoenician_yodh.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[i]}}, '\u0101lep [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}, [[ayin|\u02bfayin]] [[File:Phoenician_ayin.svg|10px]] denoted {{IPA|[a]}}{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=85}} and [[he (letter)|h\u0113]] [[File:Phoenician_he.svg|10px]] and [[Heth|{{transl|sem|\u1e25\u0113t}}]] [[File:phoenician heth.png|10px]] could also be used to signify {{IPA|[a]}}.<ref>Jongeling, K., Robert M. Kerr. 2005. Late Punic epigraphy: an introduction to the study of Neo-Punic and Latino-Punic Inscriptions</ref> This latter system was used first with foreign words and was then extended to many native words as well.\n\nA third practice reported in the literature is the use of the consonantal letters for vowels in the same way as had occurred in the original adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet to Greek and Latin, which was apparently still transparent to Punic writers: h\u0113 [[File:Phoenician_he.svg|10px]] for {{IPA|[e]}} and '\u0101lep [[File:phoenician aleph.svg|10px]] for {{IPA|[a]}}.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=175}}\n\nLater, Punic inscriptions began to be written in the Latin alphabet, which also indicated the vowels.

Next, from Canaanite to Phoenician, the sibilants {{transl|sem|*\u015b}} and {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} were merged as {{transl|sem|*\u0161}}, {{transl|sem|*\u1e2b}} and {{transl|sem|*\u1e25}} were merged as {{transl|sem|\u1e25}}, and *{{transl|sem|\u02bb}} and *{{transl|sem|\u0121}} were merged as *{{transl|sem|\u02bb}}.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=87}}<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} These latter developments also occurred in Biblical Hebrew at one point or another.\n\n==== Sibilants ====\nThe original value of the [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] sibilants, and accordingly of their Phoenician counterparts, is disputed. Recent scholarship argues that {{transl|sem|\u0161}} was {{IPA|[s]}}, {{transl|sem|s}} was {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{transl|sem|z}} was {{IPA|[dz]}}, and {{transl|sem|\u1e63}} was {{IPA|[ts\u02bc]}},{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=86}} against the traditional sound values of {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}, and {{IPA|[s\u02e4]}} as reflected in the transcription.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=59}}\n\nOn the other hand, it is debated whether [[shin (letter)|\u0161\u012bn]] [[File:Phoenician_sin.svg|10px]] and [[samekh|s\u0101mek]] [[File:Phoenician_samekh.svg|10px]], which are mostly well distinguished by the Phoenician orthography, also eventually merged at some point, either in Classical Phoenician or in Late Punic.<ref>Kerr, Robert M. 2010.

Neither these nor the emphatics could be adequately represented by the Latin alphabet, but there is also evidence to that effect from Punic script transcriptions.\n\n==== Lenition ====\nThere is no consensus on whether Phoenician-Punic ever underwent the [[lenition]] of [[stop consonant]]s that happened in most other Northwest Semitic languages such as Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (cf. Hackett{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=87}} vs Segert{{sfn|Segert|1997}} and Lyavdansky).<ref name=\"lyavd\" /> The consonant {{IPA|/p/}} may have been ''generally'' transformed into {{IPA|/f/}} in Punic and in late Phoenician, as it was in Proto-Arabic.<ref name=\"lyavd\">\u041b\u044f\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410.\u041a. 2009. \u0424\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430: \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0410.\u0413. \u0438 \u0434\u0440.

P.105 ff.</ref> However, in Neo-Punic, *b lenited to v contiguous to a following consonant, as in the Latin transcription ''lifnim'' for {{Script|Phnx|\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0c}} *lbnm \"for his son\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Vowels===\nKnowledge of the vowel system is very imperfect because of the characteristics of the writing system. During most of its existence, Phoenician writing showed no vowels at all, and even as vowel notation systems did eventually arise late in its history, they never came to be applied consistently to native vocabulary. It is thought that Phoenician had the short vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and the long vowels {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=87}}{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=60}} The Proto-Semitic diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} are realized as {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}. That must have happened earlier than in Biblical Hebrew since the resultant long vowels are not marked with the semivowel letters (''b\u0113t'' \"house\" was written {{Script|Phnx|\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd15}} '''bt''', in contrast to Biblical Hebrew {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea}} '''byt''').\n\nThe most conspicuous vocalic development in Phoenician is the so-called [[Canaanite shift]], partly shared by Biblical Hebrew, but going further in Phoenician. The Proto-Northwest Semitic {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} became not merely {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} as in [[Tiberian Hebrew]], but {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Stressed Proto-Semitic {{IPA|/a/}} became Tiberian Hebrew {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} ({{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} in other traditions), but Phoenician {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}. The shift is proved by Latin and Greek transcriptions like ''r\u016bs'' for \"head, cape\" (Tiberian Hebrew ''r\u014d\u0161'', {{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9}}), ''sam\u014d'' for \"he heard\" (Tiberian Hebrew ''\u0161\u0101m\u0101\u02bb'', {{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05de\u05e2}}); similarly the word for \"eternity\" is known from Greek transcriptions to have been ''\u02bb\u016bl\u014dm'', corresponding to Biblical Hebrew ''\u02bb\u014dl\u0101m'' and Proto-Semitic ''\u02bb\u0101lam''. The letter Y used for words such as ''ys'' \"which\" and ''yth'' (definite accusative marker) in Greek and Latin alphabet inscriptions can be interpreted as denoting a reduced [[schwa]] vowel{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=175}} that occurred in pre-stress syllables in verbs and two syllables before stress in nouns and adjectives,{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}} while other instances of Y as in ''chyl'' and even ''chil'' for /kull/ \"all\" in ''[[Poenulus]]'' can be interpreted as a further stage in the vowel shift resulting in fronting ({{IPA|[y]}}) and even subsequent delabialization of {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}}{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=61}} Short {{IPA|/*i/}} in originally-open syllables was lowered to {{IPA|[e]}} and was also lengthened if it was accented.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=88}}\n\n===Suprasegmentals===\n\nStress-dependent vowel changes indicate that stress was probably mostly final, as in Biblical Hebrew.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=89}} Long vowels probably occurred only in open syllables.{{sfn|Segert|1997|p=63}}\n\n==Grammar==\nAs is typical for the Semitic languages, Phoenician words are usually built around consonantal roots and vowel changes are used extensively to express [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] distinctions. However, unlike most Semitic languages, Phoenician preserved numerous uniconsonantal and biconsonantal roots inherited from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afro-Asiatic]]: compare the verbs '''kn''' \"to be\" vs Arabic '''kwn''', '''mt''' \"to die\" vs Hebrew and Arabic '''mwt''' and '''sr''' \"to remove\" vs Hebrew '''srr'''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=i08KAQAAMAAJ&q=|title=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft|last=Stade|first=Bernhard|last2=Marti|first2=Karl|date=1970|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=|location=|pages=272|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===No<span class=\"ve-ce-branchNode-slug ve-ce-branchNode-inlineSlug\"></span>minal morphology===\nNouns are marked for gender (masculine and feminine), number (singular, plural and vestiges of the dual) and state (absolute and construct, the latter being nouns that are followed by their possessors) and also have the category definiteness. There is some evidence for remains of the Proto-Semitic genitive [[grammatical case]] as well. While many of the endings coalesce in the standard orthography, inscriptions in the Latin and Greek alphabet permit the reconstruction of the noun endings, which are also the adjective endings, as follows:<ref>Segert, Stanislav. 2007.

However, evidence has been found for a retention of the genitive case in the form of the first-singular possessive suffix: '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcby}}''' /{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}abiya/ \"of my father\" vs '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcb}}''' /{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}ab\u012b/ \"my father\". If true, this may suggest that cases were still distinguished to some degree in other forms as well.\n\nThe written forms and the reconstructed pronunciations of the personal pronouns are as follows:{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=85|loc=The description of the pronouns follows Hackett}}\n\nSingular: <br>\n1st: /{{transl|sem|\u02bcan\u014dk\u012b}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcnk}}''' (Punic sometimes '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcnky}}'''), also attested as /{{transl|sem|\u02bcanek}}/<br>\n2nd masc. /{{transl|sem|\u02bcatta(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bct}}'''<br>\n2nd fem. /{{transl|sem|\u02bcatti(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|\u02bct}}'''<br>\n3rd masc. /{{transl|sem|hu\u02bc}}/ '''{{transl|sem|h\u02bc}}''', also [{{transl|sem|hy}}] (?)

They appear in a slightly different form depending on whether or not they follow plural-form masculine nouns (and so are added after a vowel).

Their pronunciation can then be reconstructed somewhat differently: first-person singular /{{transl|sem|-iya(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''', third-person singular masculine and feminine /{{transl|sem|-iyu(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}''' and /{{transl|sem|-iya(\u02d0)}}/ '''{{transl|sem|y}}'''. The third-person plural singular and feminine must have pronounced the same in both cases, i.e. /{{transl|sem|-n\u014dm}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}''' and /{{transl|sem|-n\u0113m}}/ '''{{transl|sem|nm}}'''.\n\nThese enclitic forms vary between the dialects. In the archaic [[Byblos|Byblian]] dialect, the third person forms are '''h''' and '''w''' /{{transl|sem|-\u014d}}/ for the masculine singular (a.V. '''w''' /{{transl|sem|-\u0113w}}/), '''h''' /{{transl|sem|-aha(\u02d0)}}/ for the feminine singular and '''hm''' /{{transl|sem|-hum(ma)}}/ for the masculine plural. In late Punic, the 3rd masculine singular is usually /{{transl|sem|-im}}/ '''{{transl|sem|m}}'''.\n\nThe same enclitic pronouns are also attached to verbs to denote direct objects. In that function, some of them have slightly divergent forms: first singular /{{transl|sem|-n\u012b}}/ '''{{transl|sem|n}}''' and probably first plural /{{transl|sem|-nu(\u02d0)}}/.\n\nThe near demonstrative pronouns (\"this\") are written, in standard Phoenician, '''z''' for the singular and '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcl}}''' for the plural. Cypriot Phoenician displays '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcz}}''' instead of '''z'''. Byblian still distinguishes, in the singular, a masculine '''{{transl|sem|zn}}''' / '''{{transl|sem|z}}''' from a feminine '''{{transl|sem|zt}}''' / '''{{transl|sem|z\u02bc}}'''. There are also many variations in Punic, including '''st''' and '''zt''' for both genders in the singular. The far demonstrative pronouns (\"that\") are identical to the independent third-person pronouns. The interrogative pronouns are {{IPA|/miya/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/mi/}} '''{{transl|sem|my}}''' \"who\" and {{IPA|/m\u016b/}} '''{{transl|sem|m}}''' \"what\". An indefinite pronoun \"anything\" is written '''mnm'''. The relative pronoun is a '''{{transl|sem|\u0161}}''', either followed or preceded by a vowel.\n\nThe definite article was {{IPA|/ha-/}}, and the first consonant of the following word was doubled. It was written '''h''' but in late Punic also '''{{transl|sem|\u02bc}}''' and '''{{transl|sem|\u02bb}}''' because of the weakening and coalescence of the gutturals. Much as in Biblical Hebrew, the initial consonant of the article is dropped after the prepositions '''b-''', '''l-''' and '''k'''; it could also be lost after various other particles and function words, such the direct object marker '''{{transl|sem|\u02bcyt}}''' and the conjunction '''w-''' \"and\".\n\nOf the cardinal numerals from 1 to 10, 1 is an adjective, 2 is formally a noun in the dual and the rest are nouns in the singular.

The old Semitic jussive, which originally differed slightly from the prefix conjugation, is no longer possible to separate from it in Phoenician with the present data.\n\nThe non-finite forms are the infinitive construct, the infinitive absolute and the active and passive participles. In the G-stem, the infinitive construct is usually combined with the preposition '''l-''' \"to\", as in {{transl|sem|/liqtul/}} \"to kill\"; in contrast, the infinitive absolute (qat\u014dl){{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=96}} is mostly used to strengthen the meaning of a subsequent finite verb with the same root: {{transl|sem|'''pt\u1e25 tpt\u1e25 '''}} \"you will indeed open!\",<ref name=segert82/> accordingly /{{transl|sem|*qat\u014dl tiqtul}}/ \"you will indeed kill!\".\n\nThe participles had, in the G-stem, the following forms: <br>\nActive: <br>\nMasculine singular /{{transl|sem|q\u016btel}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|q\u014dtil}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qotlim}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|q\u014dtil\u012bm}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}<br>\nFeminine singular {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}, plural *{{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}<br>\nPassive: <br>\nMasculine singular /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl}}/<ref name=segert82/> or /{{transl|sem|qat\u012bl}}/<ref name=lyavd293/> {{transl|sem|'''qtl'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl\u012bm}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtlm'''}}<br>\nFeminine singular {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}, plural /{{transl|sem|qat\u016bl\u014dt}}/ {{transl|sem|'''qtlt'''}}\n\nThe missing forms above can be inferred from the correspondences between the Proto-Northwest Semitic ancestral forms and the attested Phoenician counterparts: the PNWS participle forms are *{{transl|sem|/q\u0101til-, q\u0101til\u012bma, q\u0101til(a)t, q\u0101til\u0101t, qat\u016bl, qat\u016bl\u012bm, qatult or qat\u016blat, qat\u016bl\u0101t/}}.\n\nThe derived stems are:\n* the N-stem (functioning as a passive), e.g. '''nqtl''', the N-formant being lost in the prefix conjugation while assimilating and doubling the first root consonant ('''yqtl''').\n* the D-stem (functioning as a factitive): the forms must have been /qittil/ in the suffix conjugation, /yaqattil/ in the prefix conjugation, /qattil/ in the imperative and the infinitive construct, /qatt\u014dl/ in the infinitive absolute and /maqattil/ in the participle. The characteristic doubling of the middle consonant is only identifiable in foreign alphabet transcriptions.\n* the C-stem (functioning as a causative): the original *ha- prefix has produced *yi- rather than the Hebrew *hi-. The forms were apparently /yiqtil/ in the suffix conjugation ({{transl|sem|/\u02bciqtil}}/ in late Punic), /yaqtil/ in the prefix conjugation, and the infinitive is also /yaqtil/, while the participle was probably /maqtil/ or, in late Punic at least, /miqtil/.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=97}}\n\nMost of the stems apparently also had passive and reflexive counterparts, the former differing through vowels, the latter also through the infix '''-t-'''. The G stem passive is attested as '''qytl''', {{transl|sem|/qytal/}} < *{{transl|sem|/qutal/}}.;<ref name=segert82/> t-stems can be reconstructed as /yitqatil/ '''ytqtl''' (tG) and /yiqtattil/ (Dt) '''yqttl'''.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=99}}\n\n===Prepositions and particles===\nSome prepositions are always prefixed to nouns, deleting, if present, the initial {{IPA|/h/}} of the definite article: such are '''b-''' \"in\", '''l-''' \"to, for\", '''k-''' \"as\" and '''m-''' /{{transl|sem|min}}/ \"from\". They are sometimes found in forms extended through the addition of '''-n''' or '''-t'''. Other prepositions are not like that:{{transl|sem|'''\u02bbl'''}} \"upon\", .{{transl|sem|'''\u02bbd'''}} \"until\", {{transl|sem|'''\u02bc\u1e25r'''}} \"after\", {{transl|sem|'''t\u1e25t'''}} \"under\", {{transl|sem|'''b(y)n'''}} \"between\". New prepositions are formed with nouns: '''lpn''' \"in front of\", from '''l-''' \"to\" and '''pn''' \"face\". There is a special preposited marker of a definite object {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcyt'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bciyy\u016bt}}/?), which, unlike Hebrew, is clearly distinct from the preposition {{transl|sem|'''\u02bct'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bcitt}}/).\n\nThe most common negative marker is {{transl|sem|'''bl'''}} (/{{transl|sem|bal}}/), negating verbs but sometimes also nouns; another one is {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcy'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bc\u012b}}/), expressing both nonexistence and the negation of verbs. Negative commands or prohibitions are expressed with {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcl'''}} (/{{transl|sem|\u02bcal}}/). \"Lest\" is {{transl|sem|'''lm'''}}. Some common conjunctions are {{transl|sem|'''w'''}} (originally perhaps /{{transl|sem|wa-?}}/, but certainly /{{transl|sem|u-}}/ in Late Punic), \"and\" {{transl|sem|'''\u02bcm'''}} ({{transl|sem|/\u02bcim/}}), \"when\", and {{transl|sem|'''k'''}} ({{transl|sem|/k\u012b/}}), \"that; because; when\". There was also a conjunction {{transl|sem|('''\u02bc''')'''p'''}} ({{transl|sem|/\u02bcap/}}\"also\". {{transl|sem|'''l-'''}} (/{{transl|sem|l\u016b, li}}/) could (rarely) be used to introduce desiderative constructions (\"may he do X!\"). {{transl|sem|'''l-'''}} could also introduce vocatives. Both prepositions and conjunctions could form compounds.{{sfn|Hackett|2008|p=98}}\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order is [[verb-subject-object]]. There is no verb \"to be\" in the present tense; in clauses that would have used a copula, the subject may come before the predicate. Nouns precede their modifiers, such as adjectives and possessors.\n\n==Vocabulary and word formation==\nMost nouns are formed by a combination of consonantal roots and vocalic patterns, but they can formed also with prefixes ({{IPA|/m-/}}, expressing actions or their results, and rarely {{IPA|/t-/}}) and suffixes {{IPA|/-\u016bn/}}. Abstracts can be formed with the suffix '''-t''' (probably {{IPA|/-\u012bt/}}, {{IPA|/-\u016bt/}}).<ref name=lyavd293>\u041b\u044f\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410.\u041a. 2009. \u0424\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430: \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0410.\u0413. \u0438 \u0434\u0440.

The Punic throughout its existence co-existed with the [[Berber language]] which is native to [[Tunisia]] (Including Carthage) and North Africa. Punic disappeared some time after the destruction of Carthage by the Romans and the Berbers. It is possible that Punic may have survived the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in some small isolated area: the geographer [[al-Bakri]] describes a people speaking a language that was not [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Latin]] or [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in the city of [[Sirte]] in rural [[Ifriqiya]], a region in which spoken Punic survived well past its written use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/vtw/jongeling/latpun/LPINTRO.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-25 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109091842/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/vtw/jongeling/LATPUN/LPINTRO.htm |archivedate=2005-11-09 |df= }}</ref> However, it is likely that arabization of the Punics was facilitated by their language belonging to the same group (both being [[Semitic languages]]) as that of the conquerors and thus having many grammatical and lexical similarities. Most Punic speakers may have been linguistically Berberized and/or Latinized after the fall of Carthage.\n\nThe ancient Libyco-Berber alphabet that is still in irregular use by modern Berber groups such as the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] is known by the native name [[Tifinagh]], possibly a derived form of a cognate of the name \"Punic\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Still, a direct derivation from the Phoenician-Punic script is debated and far from established since the two writing systems are very different. As far as language (not the script) is concerned, some borrowings from Punic appear in modern Berber dialects: one interesting example is ''agadir'' \"wall\" from Punic ''gader''.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting case of Punic influence is that of the name of [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], comprising [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), which, according to one of the theories, is derived from the Punic ''I-Shaphan'' meaning \"coast of [[hyrax]]es\", in turn a misidentification on the part of Phoenician explorers of its numerous [[rabbit]]s as hyraxes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Another case is the name of a tribe of hostile \"hairy people\" that [[Hanno the Navigator]] found in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The name given to those people by [[Hanno the Navigator]]'s interpreters was transmitted from Punic into Greek as ''gorillai'' and was applied in 1847 by [[Thomas S. Savage]] to the [[western gorilla]].\n\n==Surviving examples==\nPhoenician, together with Punic, is primarily known from approximately 10,000 surviving inscriptions,{{sfn|Lehmann|2013|p=209|ps=:Nearly two hundred years later the repertory of Phoenician-Punic epigraphy counts about 10.000 inscriptions from throughout the Mediterranean and its environs. Nevertheless, almost 150 years after Gesenius, Wolfgang R\u00f6llig bewailed once more that \"notwithstanding the welcome increase of textual material in the past decades, Phoenician probably remains the worst transmitted and least known of all Semitic languages.}} supplemented by occasional glosses in books written in other languages. In addition to their many inscriptions, the Phoenicians are believed to have left numerous other types of written sources, but most have not survived.{{quote|The Phoenician alphabetic script was easy to write on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] sheets, and the use of these materials explains why virtually no Phoenician writings \u2013 no history, no trading records \u2013 have come down to us. In their cities by the sea, the air and soil were damp, and papyrus and leather moldered and rotted away. Thus disappeared the literature of the people who taught a large portion of the earth's population to write. The only written documents of Phoenicians and [[Carthaginians]] are monumental inscriptions on stone, a few ephemeral letters or notes on pieces of broken pottery, and three fragmentary papyri. Thus, no Tyrian primary sources dating from [[Hiram I]]'s time are available.<ref>Lipi\u0144ski (1995), p.1321-1322</ref>}}\n\nRoman authors, such as [[Sallust]], allude to some books written in the [[Punic language]], but none have survived except occasionally in translation (e.g., Mago's treatise) or in snippets (e.g., in [[Plautus]]' plays). The [[Cippi of Melqart]], a [[bilingual inscription]] in Ancient Greek and Carthaginian discovered in [[Malta]] in 1694, was the key which allowed French scholar [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy]] to decipher and reconstruct the alphabet in 1758.{{sfn|Lehmann|2013}} Even as late as 1837 only 70 Phoenician inscriptions were known to scholars. These were compiled in [[Wilhelm Gesenius]]'s ''Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae monumenta'', which comprised all that was known of Phoenician by scholars at that time.{{quote|Basically, its core consists of the comprehensive edition, or re-edition of 70 Phoenician and some more non-Phoenician inscriptions... However, just to note the advances made in the nineteenth century, it is noteworthy that Gesenius\u2019 precursor Hamaker, in his Miscellanea Phoenicia of 1828, had only 13 inscriptions at his disposal. On the other hand only 30 years later the amount of Phoenician inscribed monuments had grown so enormously that Schr\u00f6der in his compendium ''Die ph\u00f6nizische Sprache. Entwurf einer Grammatik nebst Sprach- und Schriftproben'' of 1869 could state that Gesenius knew only a quarter of the material Schr\u00f6der had at hand himself.{{sfn|Lehmann|2013|p=240}}|sign=|source=}}\nSome key surviving inscriptions of Phoenician are:\n\n*[[Ahiram sarcophagus]]\n*[[Bodashtart]]\n*[[\u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription]]\n*[[Cippi of Melqart]]\n*[[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]]\n*[[Karatepe]]\n*[[Kilamuwa Stela]]\n*[[Nora Stone]]\n*[[Pyrgi Tablets]]\n*[[Temple of Eshmun]]\n\nSince [[Pyrgi Tablets|bilingual tablets]] with inscriptions in both [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and Phoenician dating from around 500 BC were found in 1964, more Etruscan has been deciphered through comparison to the more fully understood Phoenician.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Punic language]]\n*[[Phoenician alphabet]]\n*[[Emerald Tablet]]\n*[[Extinct language]]\n*[[List of extinct languages of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{NIE Poster|Ph\u0153nician Language}}\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Phoenician language\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n*Fox, Joshua. \"A Sequence of Vowel Shifts in Phoenician and Other Languages.\" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 55, no. 1 (1996): 37-47. https://www.jstor.org/stable/545378.\n* {{cite book |last=Hackett |first=Joe Ann |year=2008 |chapter=Phoenician and Punic |title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia |editor-first=Roger D. |editor-last=Woodard |url=https://e-learning.tsu.ge/pluginfile.php/5868/mod_resource/content/0/dzveli_armosavluri_enebi_-ugarituli_punikuri_arameuli_ebrauli_arabuli.pdf |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9780511486890 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511486890 |chapter-url=https://e-learning.tsu.ge/pluginfile.php/5868/mod_resource/content/0/dzveli_armosavluri_enebi_-ugarituli_punikuri_arameuli_ebrauli_arabuli.pdf#page=104 |ref=harv}}\n*Holmstedt, Robert D., and Aaron Schade.

Elverum & Sun. It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded it using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died. A departure from Elverum's previous work, ''A Crow Looked at Me'' features minimal production and sparse instrumentation alongside lyrics that tell of Castr\u00e9e's illness and death, and Elverum's ensuing grief.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively.

Elverum & Sun. It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded it using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died. A departure from Elverum's previous work, ''A Crow Looked at Me'' features minimal production and sparse instrumentation alongside lyrics that tell of Castr\u00e9e's illness and death, and Elverum's ensuing grief.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous year-end lists.
