It originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on May 1, 1999, following the television airing of the [[1999 Kids' Choice Awards]]. The episode follows the [[protagonist]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] young [[sea sponge]] named [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], attempting to get a job at a local restaurant called the [[Krusty Krab]]. However, he is tasked to find a seemingly rare high-caliber spatula because the owner, [[Mr. Krabs]], considers him unqualified for the position. Eventually, crowds of ravenous [[anchovy|anchovies]] stop by the Krusty Krab and demand meals. SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula. He utilizes the spatula to satisfy the anchovies' hunger. SpongeBob is then welcomed by Mr. Krabs as a Krusty Krab employee against the wishes of [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], the cashier of the Krusty Krab.\n\nSeries creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] initially conceived the show in 1994 and began to work on it shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' in 1996. To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached [[Tom Kenny]], who had worked with him on ''Rocko's Modern Life''. For the series [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]], Hillenburg originally wanted the idea of having SpongeBob and Squidward on a [[road trip]], inspired by the 1989 film ''[[Powwow Highway]]''. Hillenburg gave up the idea, and started new with the idea he and [[Derek Drymon]] came up for \"Help Wanted\" based on an experience Hillenburg had in the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]]. The original idea would be used for the later episode \"[[Pizza Delivery (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Pizza Delivery]]\".\n\nThe episode was written by Hillenburg who also functioned as storyboard director as well as storyboard artist, Derek Drymon, who also functioned as the credited [[storyboard artist]], and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]]. The animation was directed by the show's supervising director, [[Alan Smart]]. \"Help Wanted\" features a posthumous musical performance from [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] singing his song \"[[Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight]]\".\n\n\"Help Wanted\" was excluded in the series' first season DVD release because Nickelodeon did not want to pay Tiny Tim's [[estate (law)|estate]] for the DVD rights. It had since been released as a bonus feature to various series DVDs. \"Help Wanted\" gained an average of 6.9 million views, receiving positive reviews from media critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Help Wanted scene.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] ''(top)'' as seen in the episode with the mechanical spatula he utilized to satisfy the [[anchovy|anchovies]]' ''(bottom)'' hunger.]]\nIn the underwater, aquatic world known as [[Bikini Bottom]], a French narrator introduces [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], an ecstatic, hyperactive, optimistic, naive, annoying, but rather friendly young [[Yellow Tube Sponge]] preparing to fulfill a lifelong dream and passion by applying for a [[chef|fry cook]] job at a [[fast food restaurant]], The [[Krusty Krab]], much to the annoyance of the restaurant's cashier and SpongeBob's grumpy neighbor, an [[octopus]] named [[Squidward Tentacles]]. SpongeBob then becomes nervous and reconsiders applying for a job at the restaurant until his best friend, a [[starfish]] named [[Patrick Star]], convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, [[Mr. Krabs|Mr. Eugene Krabs]], a [[crab]] decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on [[snipe hunt|an impossible errand]] to purchase a seemingly rare high-caliber spatula.<ref name=Plot/>\n\nSoon after his anxious departure, five buses containing crowds of ravenous tourist [[Anchovy|anchovies]] stop at the Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Not before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat. The episode ends with Squidward calling for Mr. Krabs.<ref name=Plot/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Help Wanted (SpongeBoy Ahoy!).jpg|thumb|350px|right|An original storyboard for a scene from \"Help Wanted\" when the crew was going by the early working name ''SpongeBoy Ahoy!''.]]\n\"Help Wanted\" was written by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], [[Derek Drymon]], and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], and the animation was directed by the show's supervising director, [[Alan Smart]].<ref name=Plot/> Hillenburg also functioned as [[storyboard]] director, and Drymon worked as [[storyboard artist]].<ref name=Plot/> Hillenburg initially conceived the show in 1994 and began to work on it shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' in 1996.<ref name=\"Hillenburg\">{{cite video |people=Hillenburg, Stephen|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants.

It originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on May 1, 1999, following the television airing of the [[1999 Kids' Choice Awards]]. The episode follows the [[protagonist]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] young [[sea sponge]] named [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], attempting to get a job at a local restaurant called the [[Krusty Krab]]. However, he is tasked to find a seemingly rare high-caliber spatula because the owner, [[Mr. Krabs]], considers him unqualified for the position. Eventually, crowds of ravenous [[anchovy|anchovies]] stop by the Krusty Krab and demand meals. SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula. He utilizes the spatula to satisfy the anchovies' hunger. SpongeBob is then welcomed by Mr. Krabs as a Krusty Krab employee against the wishes of [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], the cashier of the Krusty Krab.\n\nSeries creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] initially conceived the show in 1994 and began to work on it shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' in 1996. To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached [[Tom Kenny]], who had worked with him on ''Rocko's Modern Life''. For the series [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]], Hillenburg originally wanted the idea of having SpongeBob and Squidward on a [[road trip]], inspired by the 1989 film ''[[Powwow Highway]]''. Hillenburg gave up the idea, and started new with the idea he and [[Derek Drymon]] came up for \"Help Wanted\" based on an experience Hillenburg had in the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]]. The original idea would be used for the later episode \"[[Pizza Delivery (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Pizza Delivery]]\".\n\nThe episode was written by Hillenburg who also functioned as storyboard director as well as storyboard artist, Derek Drymon, who also functioned as the credited [[storyboard artist]], and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]]. The animation was directed by the show's supervising director, [[Alan Smart]]. \"Help Wanted\" features a posthumous musical performance from [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] singing his song \"[[Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight]]\".\n\n\"Help Wanted\" was excluded in the series' first season DVD release because Nickelodeon did not want to pay Tiny Tim's [[estate (law)|estate]] for the DVD rights. It had since been released as a bonus feature to various series DVDs. \"Help Wanted\" gained an average of 6.9 million views, receiving positive reviews from media critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Help Wanted scene.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] ''(top)'' as seen in the episode with the mechanical spatula he utilized to satisfy the [[anchovy|anchovies]]' ''(bottom)'' hunger.]]\nIn the underwater, aquatic world known as [[Bikini Bottom]], a French narrator introduces [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], an ecstatic, hyperactive, optimistic, naive, annoying, but rather friendly young [[Yellow Tube Sponge]] preparing to fulfill a lifelong dream and passion by applying for a [[chef|fry cook]] job at a [[fast food restaurant]], The [[Krusty Krab]], much to the annoyance of the restaurant's cashier and SpongeBob's grumpy neighbor, an [[octopus]] named [[Squidward Tentacles]]. SpongeBob then becomes nervous and reconsiders applying for a job at the restaurant until his best friend, a [[starfish]] named [[Patrick Star]], convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, [[Mr. Krabs|Mr. Eugene Krabs]], a [[crab]] decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on [[snipe hunt|an impossible errand]] to purchase a seemingly rare high-caliber spatula.<ref name=Plot/>\n\nSoon after his anxious departure, five buses containing crowds of ravenous tourist [[Anchovy|anchovies]] stop at the Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Not before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.

Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal. In their second loss of the season against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 51\u201354, the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points. Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records. He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the 3rd to throw for 50 touchdowns. He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.

The Chiefs defeated the [[Houston Texans]] 51\u201331 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24\u20130 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns. The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed [[Tennessee Titans]]. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35\u201324 and advanced to [[Super Bowl LIV]]. This marked their first appearance in a Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl IV]], 50 years earlier. \n\nOn February 2, 2020, in [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]], the Chiefs played [[Super Bowl LIV]], against the NFC top seed, the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. With the game tied at 10 points each at halftime, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in the 3rd quarter, which enabled the 49ers to take a 20\u201310 lead to the fourth quarter. However, the Chiefs advanced down field, and Mahomes rebounded big-time, throwing 2 touchdowns, to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], respectively. With a 24\u201320 lead with under three minutes remaining, Williams had his second touchdown of the night, a 38-yard run, and the Chiefs lead 31\u201320. The game was sealed with a [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] interception with under a minute remaining. This marked the first time in NFL post-season history that a team faced 10 point deficits in 3 straight games, and won all 3 by 10 or more points.

Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal. In their second loss of the season against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 51\u201354, the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points. Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records. He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the 3rd to throw for 50 touchdowns. He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns. For his performance during the season, he was named [[Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award|AP NFL MVP]], the first Chief to win the award.\n\nIn the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 31\u201313 to move on to the AFC Championship Game. This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years. This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever. However, the following week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 31\u201337 overtime loss to the [[New England Patriots]].\n\nThe Chiefs finished the [[2019 NFL season|2019 regular season]] with a 12\u20134 record, winning the [[AFC West]] division title, and the AFC's second seed behind the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Chiefs defeated the [[Houston Texans]] 51\u201331 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24\u20130 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns. The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed [[Tennessee Titans]]. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35\u201324 and advanced to [[Super Bowl LIV]]. This marked their first appearance in a Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl IV]], 50 years earlier. \n\nOn February 2, 2020, in [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]], the Chiefs played [[Super Bowl LIV]], against the NFC top seed, the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. With the game tied at 10 points each at halftime, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in the 3rd quarter, which enabled the 49ers to take a 20\u201310 lead to the fourth quarter. However, the Chiefs advanced down field, and Mahomes rebounded big-time, throwing 2 touchdowns, to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], respectively. With a 24\u201320 lead with under three minutes remaining, Williams had his second touchdown of the night, a 38-yard run, and the Chiefs lead 31\u201320. The game was sealed with a [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] interception with under a minute remaining. This marked the first time in NFL post-season history that a team faced 10 point deficits in 3 straight games, and won all 3 by 10 or more points.

Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs have never worn an alternate jersey in a game, although custom jerseys are sold for retail.\n\nThe Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would be forced to wear their black uniforms on a day that forecasted for steamy temperatures.<ref>Ferrin, Reid.
