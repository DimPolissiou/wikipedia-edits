Schalke's style of play at the time  was described by a newspaper of the era as a \"wandering ball from man to man\" in a series of short, flat passes.[http://www.schalkeistdergeilsteclubderwelt.de/vereinschronik.htm]. The ''Schalker Kreisel'' (literally: \"Schalke spinning top\") was born. Schalke won all three matches played in the years 1925\u20131927.  The two teams did not meet again until the creation of the Gauliga in 1936.\n\n====Results====\n'''Schalke: 3 victories, 0 draws, 0 losses'''\n\n*3 May 1925:  Schalke 4:2 Dortmund (in [[Herne, Germany|Herne]])\n*24 October 1926:  Schalke 2:0 Dortmund \n*16 January 1927:  Dortmund 2:7 Schalke\n\n===1936\u20131944 (Gauliga Era)===\nWith the creation of the Gauliga in 1936, Dortmund developed its intense rivalry with Schalke.  Schalke was the most successful German club of the era, six of the club's to date seven German Championships and one Cup victory date back to the years of 1933 to 1945. Schalke dominated the early meetings, winning 14 matches, and losing only once, with one match played to a draw.  August Lenz's goal on 14 November 1943 secured Dortmund's first ever victory against Schalke.\n\n====Results====\n'''Schalke: 14 victories, 1 draw, 1 loss'''\n\n*'''Season 1936\u201337'''\n**20 December 1936:  Schalke 4:1 Dortmund \n**7 March 1937:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1937\u201338'''\n**30 January 1938:  Dortmund 3:3 Schalke\n**6 March 1938:  Schalke 4:0 Dortmund \n*'''Season 1938\u201339'''\n**18 September 1938:  Schalke 6:0 Dortmund \n**12 March 1939:  Dortmund 3:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1939\u201340'''\n**10 December 1939:  Schalke 9:0 Dortmund \n**4 February 1940:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1940\u201341'''\n**20 October 1940:  Schalke 10:0 Dortmund \n**2 February 1941:  Dortmund 0:2 Schalke \n*'''Season 1941\u201342'''\n**30 November 1941:  Dortmund 1:6 Schalke \n**22 March 1942:  Schalke 6:1 Dortmund \n*'''Season 1942\u201343'''\n**29 November 1942:  Schalke 2:0 Dortmund \n**26 December 1942:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1943\u201344'''\n**14 November 1943:  Dortmund 1:0 Schalke \n**27 February 1944:  Schalke 4:1 Dortmund\n\n===1945\u20131947 (Post-war Era)===\nDortmund win the Westphalia championship final 3\u20132 over Schalke, ending Schalke's domination in the region.\n\n====Results====\n'''Dortmund: 1 win, 0 draws, 0 losses'''\n\n*18 May 1947:  Dortmund 3:2 Schalke  (in [[Herne, Germany|Herne]])\n\n===1947\u20131963 (Oberliga Era)===\nThe years 1947\u201363 continued to be a reversal of fortune for Dortmund, winning 9 of the first 13 '''Revierderbies''' during this era, and losing only 7 of 32 overall.

After Dortmund's 0\u20133 defeat on 4 March 1972, and subsequent relegation from the league, the teams did not play each other again until 1975.\n\nAfter Dortmund's return to the [[Bundesliga]], [[Lothar Huber]]'s goal in the 87th minute on 5 November 1977 gave Dortmund their first victory over Schalke in nearly ten years.  The following years belonged to Dortmund, winning eleven matches to Schalke's six, culminating in a 3\u20132 victory in a [[German Cup]] match on 9 December 1988.  Schalke's relegation after the 1987\u201388 season resulted in these teams not playing again until the 1991\u201392 campaign.\n\nSchalke's next '''Revierderby''' was remarkable.  With Schalke managing only three goals in their first four matches after returning to the [[Bundesliga]], Dortmund seemed assured of continuing their success.  On 24 August 1991, in front of over 70,000 fans, former Dortmund midfielder [[Ingo Anderbr\u00fcgge]] scored in the 2nd minute to put Schalke ahead 1\u20130.  However, Dortmund equalized in the 36th and the 1st half finished with the scored tied 1\u20131.  In the 2nd half, Schalke exploded, stunning Dortmund 5\u20132. Dortmund's overall success that season eclipsed the defeat, winning the next '''Revierderby''' 2\u20130, and finishing the league in second place that year, tied in points, but losing out to [[VfB Stuttgart]] on goal differential.\n\n[[File:Arena Auf Schalke hosting Schalke 04 vs Dortmund in 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Borussia Dortmund]] against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] in 2009]]\nThe following years saw Schalke holding a slim advantage since 1991, winning 11, drawing 14, and losing 8 of the matches.  Despite Schalke's recent '''Revierderby''' success, including losing only five derbies since 1999 (until 14. April 2012), Dortmund holds the advantage in overall success during this era, winning five [[Bundesliga]] championships (1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 2001\u201302, 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312), one German Cup (2012), one [[UEFA Champions League]] competition (1997), and one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] (1997) since 1995, while Schalke won the [[UEFA Cup]] once (1997) and the [[German Cup]] three times (2001, 2002 and 2011).\n\nRecent years have seen the first-ever Bundesliga derby aired live on free TV (January 2004, shown on ARD), as well as two famous Dortmund victories. One of these, in 2005, ended a nearly seven-year undefeated streak for Schalke in the derby, while the other, in May 2007, took on almost traumatic proportions, as Schalke lost the derby and the league lead, which they had held for three months, on the penultimate day of the season in Dortmund. After each of these victories, Borussia Dortmund took the unprecedented step of selling specially-decorated replica shirts to commemorate the occasion. In 2008, Dortmund fan groups celebrated Schalke's fifty years without a league title.\n\n====Results in Bundesliga====\n'''Dortmund: 33 wins, 30 draws, 32

Schalke's style of play at the time  was described by a newspaper of the era as a \"wandering ball from man to man\" in a series of short, flat passes.[http://www.schalkeistdergeilsteclubderwelt.de/vereinschronik.htm]. The ''Schalker Kreisel'' (literally: \"Schalke spinning top\") was born. Schalke won all three matches played in the years 1925\u20131927.  The two teams did not meet again until the creation of the Gauliga in 1936.\n\n====Results====\n'''Schalke: 3 victories, 0 draws, 0 losses'''\n\n*3 May 1925:  Schalke 4:2 Dortmund (in [[Herne, Germany|Herne]])\n*24 October 1926:  Schalke 2:0 Dortmund \n*16 January 1927:  Dortmund 2:7 Schalke\n\n===1936\u20131944 (Gauliga Era)===\nWith the creation of the Gauliga in 1936, Dortmund developed its intense rivalry with Schalke.  Schalke was the most successful German club of the era, six of the club's to date seven German Championships and one Cup victory date back to the years of 1933 to 1945. Schalke dominated the early meetings, winning 14 matches, and losing only once, with one match played to a draw.  August Lenz's goal on 14 November 1943 secured Dortmund's first ever victory against Schalke.\n\n====Results====\n'''Schalke: 14 victories, 1 draw, 1 loss'''\n\n*'''Season 1936\u201337'''\n**20 December 1936:  Schalke 4:1 Dortmund \n**7 March 1937:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1937\u201338'''\n**30 January 1938:  Dortmund 3:3 Schalke\n**6 March 1938:  Schalke 4:0 Dortmund \n*'''Season 1938\u201339'''\n**18 September 1938:  Schalke 6:0 Dortmund \n**12 March 1939:  Dortmund 3:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1939\u201340'''\n**10 December 1939:  Schalke 9:0 Dortmund \n**4 February 1940:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1940\u201341'''\n**20 October 1940:  Schalke 10:0 Dortmund \n**2 February 1941:  Dortmund 0:2 Schalke \n*'''Season 1941\u201342'''\n**30 November 1941:  Dortmund 1:6 Schalke \n**22 March 1942:  Schalke 6:1 Dortmund \n*'''Season 1942\u201343'''\n**29 November 1942:  Schalke 2:0 Dortmund \n**26 December 1942:  Dortmund 0:7 Schalke \n*'''Season 1943\u201344'''\n**14 November 1943:  Dortmund 1:0 Schalke \n**27 February 1944:  Schalke 4:1 Dortmund\n\n===1945\u20131947 (Post-war Era)===\nDortmund win the Westphalia championship final 3\u20132 over Schalke, ending Schalke's domination in the region.\n\n====Results====\n'''Dortmund: 1 win, 0 draws, 0 losses'''\n\n*18 May 1947:  Dortmund 3:2 Schalke  (in [[Herne, Germany|Herne]])\n\n===1947\u20131963 (Oberliga Era)===\nThe years 1947\u201363 continued to be a reversal of fortune for Dortmund, winning 9 of the first 13 '''Revierderbies''' during this era, and losing only 7 of 32 overall.

After Dortmund's 0\u20133 defeat on 4 March 1972, and subsequent relegation from the league, the teams did not play each other again until 1975.\n\nAfter Dortmund's return to the [[Bundesliga]], [[Lothar Huber]]'s goal in the 87th minute on 5 November 1977 gave Dortmund their first victory over Schalke in nearly ten years.  The following years belonged to Dortmund, winning eleven matches to Schalke's six, culminating in a 3\u20132 victory in a [[German Cup]] match on 9 December 1988.  Schalke's relegation after the 1987\u201388 season resulted in these teams not playing again until the 1991\u201392 campaign.\n\nSchalke's next '''Revierderby''' was remarkable.  With Schalke managing only three goals in their first four matches after returning to the [[Bundesliga]], Dortmund seemed assured of continuing their success.  On 24 August 1991, in front of over 70,000 fans, former Dortmund midfielder [[Ingo Anderbr\u00fcgge]] scored in the 2nd minute to put Schalke ahead 1\u20130.  However, Dortmund equalized in the 36th and the 1st half finished with the scored tied 1\u20131.  In the 2nd half, Schalke exploded, stunning Dortmund 5\u20132. Dortmund's overall success that season eclipsed the defeat, winning the next '''Revierderby''' 2\u20130, and finishing the league in second place that year, tied in points, but losing out to [[VfB Stuttgart]] on goal differential.\n\n[[File:Arena Auf Schalke hosting Schalke 04 vs Dortmund in 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Borussia Dortmund]] against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] in 2009]]\nThe following years saw Schalke holding a slim advantage since 1991, winning 11, drawing 14, and losing 8 of the matches.  Despite Schalke's recent '''Revierderby''' success, including losing only five derbies since 1999 (until 14. April 2012), Dortmund holds the advantage in overall success during this era, winning five [[Bundesliga]] championships (1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 2001\u201302, 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312), one German Cup (2012), one [[UEFA Champions League]] competition (1997), and one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] (1997) since 1995, while Schalke won the [[UEFA Cup]] once (1997) and the [[German Cup]] three times (2001, 2002 and 2011).\n\nRecent years have seen the first-ever Bundesliga derby aired live on free TV (January 2004, shown on ARD), as well as two famous Dortmund victories. One of these, in 2005, ended a nearly seven-year undefeated streak for Schalke in the derby, while the other, in May 2007, took on almost traumatic proportions, as Schalke lost the derby and the league lead, which they had held for three months, on the penultimate day of the season in Dortmund. After each of these victories, Borussia Dortmund took the unprecedented step of selling specially-decorated replica shirts to commemorate the occasion. In 2008, Dortmund fan groups celebrated Schalke's fifty years without a league title.\n\n====Results in Bundesliga====\n'''Dortmund: 33 wins, 30 draws, 32

In his treatise ''Tajd\u012bd-o-Ahy\u0101-e-D\u012bn'' (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 31st Printing: 1999, p.&nbsp;76; English edition translated by Al-Ash`ari titled: ''A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam,'' Lahore: Islamic Publications, 9th edition: 2004, p.&nbsp;43), Mawdudi advances the following claim about the influence of Ibn Taymiyyah by appealing to the authority of the great scholar Goldziher:\n\n''\"... he had acquired such an insight into the Jewish and Christian literatures and the differences between their religious sects that, according to Goldziher, no scholar who wanted to deal with the characters of the Bible could lose sight of and set aside the researches of Ibn-i-Taimiyyah.\" ''\n\nAs a matter of fact Goldziher expressed his views and analyses about Ibn Taymiyyah's influence in his ''The Z\u0101hir\u012bs'' (Engl. tr. 2008, pp.&nbsp;173\u2013177) as well as in his article on Ibn Taymiyyah in the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' (Vol. 7, p.&nbsp;72). In neither of the mentioned writings does Goldziher say anything amounting to what Mawdudi attributed to him in his above-cited claim. What Goldziher did write was the following:\n\n''\" In his writings he [i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah] is a zealous adversary of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. By way of inciting the Muslims against them, he pointed to the Mongol invasion which had just swept over Syria, asserting that the visitation was in part due to the laxity of his co-religionists. He issued a fatwa demanding\nthat the Jewish synagogues in Cairo should be destroyed, and urging his people not to allow the chapels of other faiths to exist in their midst...\"''\n\n== Views ==\n=== God's Attributes ===\nIbn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.<ref name=\":2\" /> Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).<ref name=\":2\" /> Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, \"provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1299, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed.

The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]].

He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":17\" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi' al-Tabi'in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=\":2\" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden. He also praised and wrote a commentary on some speeches of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]].<ref name=\"qadiri\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.se/~m9783/n/itaysf_e.html |title=IBN TAYMIYYA ON FUTOOH AL-GHAYB AND SUFISM |author=G.

It is obligatory to take the initiative in fighting those people, as soon as the Prophet's summons with the reasons for which they are fought has reached them.

On the contrary, he explicitly states: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers.\"<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'', 1980, p. 603</ref> In this particular respect, he differed little from all his contemporaries; for just as practically all of the era's scholars believed that \"the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable\",<ref name=\"Josef W.

James Pavlin, for example, has argued: \"Ibn Taymiyya remains one of the most controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by ... [his] alleged supporters.\"<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Epistle on Worship: Risalat al-'Ubudiyya'', tr. James Pavlin (London: Islamic Text Society, 2015), intro.</ref> Additionally, Abdul Haq Ansari has argued that the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected [[Sufism]] outright is erroneous, for while \"the popular image of Ibn Taymiyyah [is] ... that he [criticized] Sufism indiscriminately ...

Abdul Haq-Ansari, \"Ibn Taymiyyah and Sufism\", ''Islamic Studies'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1985), pp. 1-12</ref> it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyyah actually considered Sufism an essential part of Islam, being on the whole \"sympathetic\"<ref name=\"M.

Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12\"/> Ibn Taymiyyah, according to the same author, seems to have wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a fundamental component at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived to be [[bidah|heretical innovations]] within them.<ref name=\"dx.doi.org\"/> Moreover, these scholars also point out that Ibn Taymiyyah had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi saints as [[Junayd]], [[Sahl al-Tustari]], [[Abu Talib al-Makki]], and even [[Bayazid Bastami]],<ref name=\"dx.doi.org\"/> and was part of the [[Qadiriyya]] Sufi order himself.<ref name=\"Makdisi, 1973 pp 118-28\"/><ref name=\"Arch91\"/><ref name=\"Rapoport 334\"/><ref name=\"Halverson 2010 48\u201349\"/>\n\n== Works ==\nIbn Taymiyyah left a considerable body of work, ranging from 350 according to his student [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/wasiti/taimiyah_3.html#HEADING3 |title=Ibn Taimiyah |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2010-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220150624/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/wasiti/taimiyah_3.html#HEADING3 |archive-date=2009-02-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to 500 according to his student [[al-Dhahabi]].<ref name=\":17\" /><ref>M.M.

In neither of the mentioned writings does Goldziher say anything amounting to what Mawdudi attributed to him in his above-cited claim. What Goldziher did write was the following:\n\n''\" In his writings he [i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah] is a zealous adversary of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. By way of inciting the Muslims against them, he pointed to the Mongol invasion which had just swept over Syria, asserting that the visitation was in part due to the laxity of his co-religionists. He issued a fatwa demanding\nthat the Jewish synagogues in Cairo should be destroyed, and urging his people not to allow the chapels of other faiths to exist in their midst...\"''\n\n== Views ==\n=== God's Attributes ===\nIbn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.<ref name=\":2\" /> Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).<ref name=\":2\" /> Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, \"provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1299, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed.

The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]].

He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":17\" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi' al-Tabi'in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=\":2\" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden.

On the contrary, he explicitly states: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars.

The other children, being too young ever to have seen it themselves, do not believe her. Led by a boy named William, they bully and antagonise her, and just before the sun comes out, William rallies the other children, and they lock her in a closet down a tunnel.\n\nAs the Sun is about to appear, their teacher arrives to take the class outside to enjoy their two hours of sunshine and, in their astonishment and joy, they all forget about Margot. They run, play, skip, jump, and prance about, savouring every second of their newly found freedoms. \"Oh, it's better than the [[sunlamp]]s, isn't it?\" one of them cries.\n\nSuddenly, a girl catches a raindrop in her hands. Thunder sounds, then the lightning comes, and the children run back inside as the sun disappears and it starts to pour again. At this point, one of them remembers Margot, who is still locked in the closet. Ashamed, they let her out of the closet, standing frozen, embarrassed over what they have done and unable to \"meet each other's glances.\"\n\nThe precious Sun has come and gone, and because of their despicable act, Margot, who loved the Sun the most, has missed it.\n\n==Adaptations==\nA 30-minute television adaptation, originally broadcast on the [[PBS]]' children's series ''[[WonderWorks]]'' in 1982.
