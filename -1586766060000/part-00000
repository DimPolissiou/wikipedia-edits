The number of teams in the competition has varied over the years from as high as 17 (1992\u201393 season) to as low as 11 (2012). As of 2019, the league includes 16 teams. Each team plays every other team twice during the course of the season. At the end of the season two teams are relegated to the [[Belarusian First League]], and two are promoted from the First League to replace them.\n\n[[FC Dinamo Brest|Dinamo Brest]] are the current champions, after winning their first title.\n\n==History==\nThe Belarusian Premier League was organized in [[1992 in association football|1992]]. The first participants were: [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]], the only Belarusian side in the former [[Soviet Top League]], five teams from the lower tiers of the Soviet league system, and ten teams who were previous competitors in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian SSR]] First League.\n\nAfter the league creation, it was decided to change its schedule from a Soviet-style summer season to a European-style winter season. To perform the transition, the first season was shortened, consisting of a single round-robin tournament between 16 teams, finishing in mid-summer. Due to the shortened season, no team was relegated from the Premier League and only one was promoted from the First League. The 1992\u201393 season had 17 teams, but was reduced back to 16 teams for the following season. In 1995, the winter season experiment was proven unsuccessful due to poor weather and field conditions in Belarus in the late autumn and early spring. The season was changed back to summer, and the 1995 championship was once again held as a single round-robin tournament. Every season since 1996 has been played in the summer.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the number of competing teams has changed several times. In 2001, the league was reduced to 14 teams, but expanded back to 16 in 2003. In 2005, after two teams withdrew before the start of the season, the league was once again reduced to 14 clubs, but expanded again to 16 teams in 2008. That same year, the decision was made to gradually reduce the number of teams even more, starting with 14 teams in 2009 and 12 in 2010 onwards. 2012 season was played with only 11 teams due to last minute withdrawal of [[FC Partizan Minsk|Partizan Minsk]].\n\nIn its earliest years, the league was dominated by [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]], who won the league five times in a row between 1992 and 1995. During the next ten seasons, seven different teams finished as champions: [[FC Slavia Mozyr|Slavia Mozyr]] (1996 as MPKC Mozyr, 2000), [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] (1997, 2004), [[FC Dnepr Mogilev|Dnepr-Transmash Mogilev]] (1998), [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] (1999, 2002), [[FC Belshina Bobruisk|Belshina Bobruisk]] (2001), [[FC Gomel|Gomel]] (2003), [[FC Shakhtyor Soligorsk|Shakhtyor Soligorsk]] (2005). Since 2006, BATE Borisov has dominated the league, winning 13 championships in a row (2006\u20132018), and becoming the first Belarusian team to reach the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] (2008) and the [[UEFA Europa League]] (2009) (feats that they have achieved repeatedly in the following years).\n\nIn March 2020, the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] led to all the other football leagues in Europe to be postponed, and by the end of the month, the Belarusian Premier League was the only top flight league in the continent that was still playing.<ref> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/soccer/soccer-belarus-coronavirus.html/</ref>Due to this, the league gained substantially increased viewership from abroad, with fans from all over the world watching the games online, due to the league being the only significant professional football available. British and other betting companies also offered odds for the various matches, as the league\u2019s profile, previously relatively unknown outside of the country, grew a larger audience due to sporting inactivity elsewhere.<ref> https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/52084121/</ref><ref>

The number of teams in the competition has varied over the years from as high as 17 (1992\u201393 season) to as low as 11 (2012). As of 2019, the league includes 16 teams. Each team plays every other team twice during the course of the season. At the end of the season two teams are relegated to the [[Belarusian First League]], and two are promoted from the First League to replace them.\n\n[[FC Dinamo Brest|Dinamo Brest]] are the current champions, after winning their first title.\n\n==History==\nThe Belarusian Premier League was organized in [[1992 in association football|1992]]. The first participants were: [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]], the only Belarusian side in the former [[Soviet Top League]], five teams from the lower tiers of the Soviet league system, and ten teams who were previous competitors in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian SSR]] First League.\n\nAfter the league creation, it was decided to change its schedule from a Soviet-style summer season to a European-style winter season. To perform the transition, the first season was shortened, consisting of a single round-robin tournament between 16 teams, finishing in mid-summer. Due to the shortened season, no team was relegated from the Premier League and only one was promoted from the First League. The 1992\u201393 season had 17 teams, but was reduced back to 16 teams for the following season. In 1995, the winter season experiment was proven unsuccessful due to poor weather and field conditions in Belarus in the late autumn and early spring. The season was changed back to summer, and the 1995 championship was once again held as a single round-robin tournament. Every season since 1996 has been played in the summer.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the number of competing teams has changed several times. In 2001, the league was reduced to 14 teams, but expanded back to 16 in 2003. In 2005, after two teams withdrew before the start of the season, the league was once again reduced to 14 clubs, but expanded again to 16 teams in 2008. That same year, the decision was made to gradually reduce the number of teams even more, starting with 14 teams in 2009 and 12 in 2010 onwards. 2012 season was played with only 11 teams due to last minute withdrawal of [[FC Partizan Minsk|Partizan Minsk]].\n\nIn its earliest years, the league was dominated by [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]], who won the league five times in a row between 1992 and 1995. During the next ten seasons, seven different teams finished as champions: [[FC Slavia Mozyr|Slavia Mozyr]] (1996 as MPKC Mozyr, 2000), [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] (1997, 2004), [[FC Dnepr Mogilev|Dnepr-Transmash Mogilev]] (1998), [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] (1999, 2002), [[FC Belshina Bobruisk|Belshina Bobruisk]] (2001), [[FC Gomel|Gomel]] (2003), [[FC Shakhtyor Soligorsk|Shakhtyor Soligorsk]] (2005). Since 2006, BATE Borisov has dominated the league, winning 13 championships in a row (2006\u20132018), and becoming the first Belarusian team to reach the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] (2008) and the [[UEFA Europa League]] (2009) (feats that they have achieved repeatedly in the following years).\n\nIn March 2020, the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] led to all the other football leagues in Europe to be postponed, and by the end of the month, the Belarusian Premier League was the only top flight league in the continent that was still playing.<ref> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/soccer/soccer-belarus-coronavirus.html/</ref>Due to this, the league gained substantially increased viewership from abroad, with fans from all over the world watching the games online, due to the league being the only significant professional football available. British betting companies also offered odds for the various matches, as the league\u2019s profile, previously relatively unknown outside of the country, grew a larger audience due to sporting inactivity elsewhere.<ref> https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/52084121/</ref><ref>

In [[2001 AFL season|2001]] he took out the Bulldogs' Best and Fairest award, the [[Charles Sutton Medal]], and continued to play well in the following seasons. in [[2002 AFL season|2002]] Luke and the [[Brisbane Lions]]'s [[Michael Voss]] were the first players to be awarded the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]] as the [[AFL Players Association]]'s Most Valuable Player (MVP)[[#Note|<sup>1</sup>]]. In [[2004 AFL season|2004]] he was the [[Western Bulldogs]]'s leading goalkicker. \n\nIn a [[2005 AFL season|2005]] match against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], Darcy suffered a season-ending knee injury when he twisted it, depriving the Bulldogs of a quality tall-forward option, something they missed during the year.\n\nOn 20 December 2005 during the final pre-season training session before the Christmas holidays, Luke re-injured the [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during a fall which dislocated his knee, which meant that he would miss the entire [[2006 AFL season|2006 season]].  The Bulldogs finished the season in eighth place, the first time the club had made the finals in six years. He had been part of a Bulldogs casualty list that included four ACL injuries during the season (up until only the Round 9 mark).\n\nDuring his time on the sidelines, he provided [[special comments]] for [[Network Ten]]'s AFL coverage, and continued to do so after his playing retirement which he announced on 2 August 2007, the end of the [[2007 AFL season]]. Luke was officially added to [[Network Ten]]'s AFL Commentary Team in 2007 (despite still playing football until the end of that season) and remained an Expert Commentator right up until the end of the [[2011 AFL season]], when the network lost broadcasting rights.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070920212633/http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/4112/Default.aspx?newsId=48473]</sup>.

In [[2001 AFL season|2001]] he took out the Bulldogs' Best and Fairest award, the [[Charles Sutton Medal]], and continued to play well in the following seasons. in [[2002 AFL season|2002]] Luke and the [[Brisbane Lions]]'s [[Michael Voss]] were the first players to be awarded the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]] as the [[AFL Players Association]]'s Most Valuable Player (MVP)[[#Note|<sup>1</sup>]]. In [[2004 AFL season|2004]] he was the [[Western Bulldogs]]'s leading goalkicker. \n\nIn a [[2005 AFL season|2005]] match against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], Darcy suffered a season-ending knee injury when he twisted it, depriving the Bulldogs of a quality tall-forward option, something they missed during the year.\n\nOn 20 December 2005 during the final pre-season training session before the Christmas holidays, Luke re-injured the [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during a fall which dislocated his knee, which meant that he would miss the entire [[2006 AFL season|2006 season]].  The Bulldogs finished the season in eighth place, the first time the club had made the finals in six years. He had been part of a Bulldogs casualty list that included four ACL injuries during the season (up until only the Round 9 mark).\n\nDuring his time on the sidelines, he provided [[special comments]] for [[Network Ten]]'s AFL coverage, and continued to do so after his playing retirement which he announced on 2 August 2007, the end of the [[2007 AFL season]]. Luke was officially added to [[Network Ten]]'s AFL Commentary Team in 2007 (despite still playing football until the end of that season) and remained an Expert Commentator right up until the end of the [[2011 AFL season]], when the network lost broadcasting rights.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070920212633/http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/4112/Default.aspx?newsId=48473]</sup>.

Texaco recently sponsored the #42 [[Dodge]] driven by Montoya. Havoline continuously sponsored a car from the early 1980s to 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Texaco / Havoline officially ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and [[Chip Ganassi Racing]]. This brought a 20+ year relationship with the sport to a close.\n\nTexaco has also been involved in [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]], sponsoring the [[Grand Prix of Houston|Texaco Grand Prix of Houston]] along with sponsoring drivers like [[Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Mario Andretti]] and his son [[Michael Andretti|Michael]].\n\nIn [[Formula One]], Texaco sponsored the [[Team Lotus]] in 1972 and 1973, and [[McLaren]] from 1974 to 1978. The company returned to Grand Prix racing at a smaller scale in 1997, with their brands appearing on the [[Stewart Grand Prix|Stewart]] [[Stewart SF01|SF01]] car. Their association with the team and its successor, [[Jaguar Racing]], continued until the end of 2001, in the same timeline they also sponsored [[ITV F1|ITV's Formula 1]] Coverage.\n\nTexaco sponsored the [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] [[Rover Vitesse]] factory team at the 1985 and 1986 [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC) under their Bastos brand, and the [[Ford Sierra RS500]] factory cars entered by [[Eggenberger Motorsport]] in the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|1987]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] (plus the 1988 ETCC and other European-based championships). Texaco also sponsored cars in the 1987 [[World Rally Championship]].\n\nFrom 1987-1993, Texaco was the major sponsor (through their Australian [[Caltex]] offshoot) [[Colin Bond Racing]] in Australian [[touring car racing]], first with the [[Alfa Romeo 75]] turbo in 1987, then the Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988-1992 and then [[Toyota]]'s in 1993. From [[2000 Australian Touring Car season|2000]] until [[2007 V8 Supercar season|2007]], it was title sponsor of [[Stone Brothers Racing]] with [[Russell Ingall]] winning the [[2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2005 championship]]. In [[2016 International V8 Supercars Championship|2016]], Caltex became title sponsor of the [[Triple Eight Race Engineering (Australia)|Triple Eight Race Engineering]] car of [[Craig Lowndes]], having previously been an associate sponsor of the team.\n\nTexaco was long associated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as sole sponsor of its radio broadcasts for 63 years. It was identified as well with such entertainment legends as [[Ed Wynn]], [[Fred Allen]] and [[Milton Berle]] (many of their shows were originally sponsored by Texaco \u2013 see [[Texaco Star Theatre]], which includes the sponsorship lyrics of the opening theme: \"We're the men of Texaco, We work from Maine to Mexico...\"). Berle's program was broadcast in the same time slot as [[Fulton J.

It has been accused of extensive environmental damage from these operations, and faces legal claims from both private plaintiffs and the government of Ecuador. The case has been widely publicized by environmental activists and is the subject of ''Crude'', a 2009 documentary film by Joe Berlinger.

Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron Corporation in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to the [[Shell Oil Company]]. It began as the '''Texas Fuel Company''', founded in 1901 in [[Beaumont, Texas]], by [[Joseph S. Cullinan]], Thomas J.

To accomplish this, Cullinan organized the Producers Oil Company in 1902, as a group of investors affiliated with The Texas Fuel Company. Men like John W. (\"Bet A Million\") Gates invested in \"certificates of interest\" to an amount of almost ninety thousand dollars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gish |first1=Elton N. |title=HISTORY of THE TEXAS COMPANY And PORT ARTHUR WORKS Refinery |url=https://www.texacohistory.com/History/ |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Future restructuring would merge Producers Oil Company and The Texas Fuel Company as Texaco when the company needed additional funding which J.W.

It was also one of the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]] which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.
