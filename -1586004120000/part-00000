This series saw Dec involved in an accident during filming of a game being pre-recorded for an episode's \"Ant vs. Dec\", in which the presenter was injured while attempting a motorbike stunt jump. The accident left him with a broken right thumb and broken left elbow, leaving him to have his left arm in a sling for a few weeks afterwards.

Whoever lost had to nominate a celebrity from their team who would be eliminated from future games. Ant's team consisted of: Paul Daniels' wife [[Debbie McGee]]; actress and singer [[Bonnie Langford]]; dancer [[Wayne Sleep]]; [[Jason \"J\" Brown]] from [[Five (band)|Five]]; and ex-[[Steps (group)|Steps]] member [[Lee Latchford-Evans]] (due to \"personal reasons\" Ant's initial choice of [[Lee Ryan]] from [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]] could not take part as planned). Dec's team consisted of: magician [[Paul Daniels]]; singer [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]]; ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' contestant [[Chico Slimani]]; TV presenter [[Melinda Messenger]]; and former footballer [[Lee Sharpe]]. The contest between the teams ended on a draw of 3-3, leading to a tie-breaker game of a basketball shoot-out to be held in the final episode to determine the winner. For this game, each presenter nominated a team member to play it, and was won by Dec's team, leading to the presenter winning this series' contest as a result.

This series is notable for two elements in its broadcast. The first was that its series finale took place outside the [[United Kingdom]], on the [[MV Britannia (2015)|MV Britannia]], while it was berthed in [[Barcelona]] - tickets for places on the cruise ship were offered during the other episodes as prizes, courtesy of the ship's operator [[P&O Cruises]] with tickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway|title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway 2016|publisher=ITV Press Centre|work=itv.com|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> The second was that it featured a live wedding in the sixth episode, between a couple who had written to the production team asking if they could be married on the programme.\n\nThe series introduced two new segments. The first, entitled \"Best Seats in the House\", offered places in the studio audience for the next episode, in a specially marked \"VIP\" section, with the exception of the first episode were the seats were given to selected members of the audience; for the penultimate episode, the viewers were given tickets for the cruise ship. The second involved a mini-serial \"whodunnit\" comedy drama entitled \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\", written by ''[[Broadchurch]]'' creator [[Chris Chibnall]], and starred [[Ant & Dec]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Louis Walsh]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], [[David Walliams]], [[Piers Morgan]], [[Olly Murs]], the late [[Caroline Flack]] and [[Ashleigh and Pudsey|Pudsey the Dog]] as themselves, and [[Kevin Whately]] and [[Emilia Fox]] as their respective characters from ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' and ''[[Silent Witness]]''. The mini-serial was later condensed into a single episode that was broadcast on 30 December 2017. Amongst the other segments for the show, the game \"Win the Ads\" received a minor change in its format, reducing the number of prizes that contestants could win in total, while final episode saw the game having the contestant chosen in the final episode was from those on the cruise ship, excluding anyone who won their place via ticket giveaway, and focusing on questions associated with being at sea.\n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured guest appearances by [[Kym Marsh]], [[Jane Danson]], [[Sally Dynevor]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Jack P. Shepherd]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Fleur East]], along with appearances by YouTubers [[Alfie Deyes]] and [[Marcus Butler]].

Like the previous series, the final episode took place outside of the United Kingdom, being broadcast live from [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], with tickets for places in that episode's audience being offered throughout the series. This series saw the introduction of two short-lived segments - \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and \"In For A Penny\" - while the segment \"Best Seat in the House\" was presented by [[Scarlett Moffatt]], after Roberts opted to not return to the show for a new series, and the stars of \"Little Ant & Dec\" now featured across the show and online, rather than in a dedicated segment. The game segment \"Win the Ads\" was also modified in this series, with it now featuring a viewer competition, in which those taking part competed against each other answered the same questions for a chance to win \u00a31,000; in the fourth and sixth episode, technical difficulties prevented the competition from being used.\n\nLike the previous series, a new mini-serial comedy drama was shown during this series broadcast, entitled \"The Missing Crown Jewels\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-01-26/ant-and-dec-reveal-details-of-saturday-night-takeaway-follow-up-to-who-shot-simon-cowell|title=Ant and Dec reveal details of Saturday Night Takeaway follow-up to Who Shot Simon Cowell?|publisher=}}</ref> starring [[Ant and Dec]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Cat Deeley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]], and which was later condensed into a single episode on 23 December 2017. [[Alfie Deyes]] & [[Marcus Butler]] didn\u2019t return after 1 series. This series also saw the introduction on an online game called \"Ant & Dec vs. YouTubers\", in which the presenters took on a pair of YouTubers on Wednesday during the series' broadcast, with filmed clips placed on the show's official [[YouTube]] channel. \n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured opening performances in a number of episodes by [[Robbie Williams]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Take That]], [[Louisa Johnson]], with the exception of the final episode in which the presenters performed a special rendition of the song ''[[Be Our Guest (Disney song)|Be Our Guest]]''. For \"Songalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Steps (group)|Steps]], [[Louisa Johnson]], [[CeeLo Green]], and was unique for a number of factors: one of the contestants who took part was [[Freddie Flintoff]], the episode's celebrity announcer, who was tasked with playing along in the game, with his success winning everyone in the studio audience tickets to the [[Steps (group)|Steps]]' comeback tour; for the sixth episode, the song used was \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", as a prize of a \"Place on the Plane\" for the series finale at Walt Disney World the following week was on offer in addition to the usual \u00a3500. This series' contest between the presenter was won by Ant with a score of 3-1. Sponsorship: [[Suzuki]].\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Episode !! Date !!

Like the previous series, the series finale took place outside of the UK at [[Universal Orlando|Universal Orlando Resort]] with tickets for places in this episode offered through the series, while it was the last series to be broadcast live from London Studios before its closure for redevelopment later in the year. This series saw \"Little Ant & Dec\" discontinued, owing to the production team deciding that the young actors for this segment had outgrown their roles and thus should be allowed to focus on their education, while \"Ant & Dec Undercover\" was restricted to just one episode, owing to the massive and complex amount of preparation done to film the segment. This series aired its 100th episode, which celebrated this milestone by featuring highlights from the last 99 episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', along with a one-off revival of the segment \"Home-Run\", and a special edition of \"Win the Ads\", hosted by [[Emma Willis]], in which the presenters tackled the game themselves on behalf of a studio audience member randomly chosen before the episode's broadcast.\n\nAs like the previous series, it features a mini-serial comedy drama entitled \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\", to be aired during the series' broadcast. The mini-serial features a large cast of celebrities: Ant & Dec, [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Olly Murs]], [[David Walliams]], [[Katie Price]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]].<!-- Add to this information on the mini-serial's cast, as it becomes available.--> Apart from the mini-serial, the series featured opening performances from [[Kylie Minogue]], [[George Ezra]], [[Paloma Faith]], as well as a special rendition of [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]] for the series finale. For \"Singalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[The Script]], and [[The Rembrandts]].<!-- Amend this line to focus on appearances for Opening Performances and Singalong Live respectively.-->\n\nThis series is notable for being affected greatly by the absence of [[Anthony McPartlin]] following the fourth episode, after he was involved in a traffic accident on 18 March 2018, connected to drink-driving, which led to him suspending further presenting duties the following day for the rest of the series and other programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463889|title= Ant McPartlin steps down from TV shows and seeks treatment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> As a direct result, it led to an episode that was planned for the 24 March 2018 to be cancelled by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and the discontinuation of \"Ant vs. Dec\" for the rest of the series. However, its most significant impact, was that it led to [[Declan Donnelly]] hosting the remaining two episodes by himself, the first time he had presented a programme in 30 years without McPartlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43487792|title=Dec to present Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> with his co-presenters [[Stephen Mulhern]] and [[Scarlett Moffatt]] receiving expanded roles in these episodes. Although absent, McPartlin appeared in these episodes but solely within the pre-recorded editions of the mini-serial \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\". The decision to continue the series after the incident had occurred was primarily down to the presenters and the production team choosing not to cancel tickets made out to people who had secured a place within the audience for the series finale in Florida.

It was also the first to be broadcast from their new home at [[Television Centre, London]] following the closure of [[The London Studios]] in 2018. [[Stephen Mulhern]] returned to host the ''Ant vs. Dec'' segment, which for this series had a \"global\" theme to all of the challenges. However, [[Scarlett Moffatt]] did not return to the show as she left to focus on other TV projects, and was not replaced.\n\nThis series saw a new mini-serial entitled ''Men in Brown'' starring Ant & Dec still serving as undercover agents for ''The Honoured'' and tasked with saving the world from an alien invasion. [[Phillip Schofield|Philip Schofield]], [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Emily Atack]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Love Island (2015 TV series, series 5)|Amber Gill]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Richard Ayoade]], [[Paddy McGuinness]], and [[Hugh Bonneville]] (replacing [[Emilia Fox]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] as the head of ''The Honoured'') are guest starring in the mini-serial.\n\nAnother new segment called ''Don't Feed the Pandas'', involved Ant & Dec dressing up in realistic prosthetic panda costumes in an attempt to fool school kids at [[London Zoo]]. Other features returning from the previous series include ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' and ''Undercover''. ''Win the Ads'' also returned with a minor tweak in its format, the viewers competition used in the previous two series was discontinued and instead, one of the 16 prizes on the board would be won not just by the contestant but for the entire studio audience as well.\n\nThe first ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' of the series was with American actor [[Mark Wahlberg]] at [[Wahlburgers|his London restaurant]] where he pranked members of the public with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The first \"End of the Show\" - Show marked the return of [[Ashley Roberts]] with [[The Pussycat Dolls]] to the show she left after Series 14 in 2017. The second ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was with British Boxer and \"[[List of world heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\" [[Anthony Joshua]] at his local boxing club where pranked three members of the public by saying that the were going to be his personal chief with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The third ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was done with British singer-songwriter and DJ [[Craig David]].  \n\n[[Andi Peters]] has been presenting the competition segment, which in the first episode was live from [[Bermuda, Warwickshire|Bermuda]], [[Nuneaton]], in the second episode was live from [[New York, Tyne and Wear|New York]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and in the fourth episode was live from [[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]], [[Derbyshire]]. He was back in the studio for episode five. In the second episode, [[Fleur East]] gave some tickets for a ''Place on the Plane'' to a winning family in [[Bristol]] and in the fourth episode Fleur East visited [[Kingston upon Hull]] where the family who guessed the restaurant correctly (which was Papas [[Fish and chip shop|Fish and Chips shop]] in Kingston upon Hull) won another ''Place on the Plane''. \n\nThe ''Place on the Plane'' giveaway was again announced on the first show of the series, with the series finale location revealed as [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] for the second time (having previously hosted the series finale in Series 14). It was also confirmed it would be the largest ever giveaway by a British television programme with 300 guests being invited to be the audience for the show this was done in partnership with [[Virgin Atlantic]]. However, on 13 March, it was announced that due to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] that the finale would be cancelled and the ticket holders would instead enjoy a 5-star hotel stay at the park at a later date. Following viewer complaints about the 14 March episode still having a live [[audience]] despite the coronavirus pandemic and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] advising against all [[Mass gathering|mass gatherings]] in an effort to slow down the spread, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] confirmed on 17 March that the remaining episodes of the series would be shot without a live audience and with a [[skeleton crew|reduced production crew]], with a shorter 60-minute running time for the 28 March episode.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/51918401|title=Coronavirus: Prime Minister advises against mass gatherings|date=2020-03-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2020-03-17|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/tv/437524-saturday-night-takeaway-crisis-talks-over-future-of-the-series-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Saturday Night Takeaway 'crisis talks' over future of the series amid coronavirus outbreak|last=Darvill|first=Josh|date=2020-03-17|website=TellyMix|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/17/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-continue-without-audience-12414416/|title=Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway to continue without an audience|last=Deen|first=Sarah|date=2020-03-18|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\nIt was later revealed on Twitter that the 28 March episode would take place live from their living rooms, whilst on a video call with each other.

This series saw Dec involved in an accident during filming of a game being pre-recorded for an episode's \"Ant vs. Dec\", in which the presenter was injured while attempting a motorbike stunt jump. The accident left him with a broken right thumb and broken left elbow, leaving him to have his left arm in a sling for a few weeks afterwards.

Whoever lost had to nominate a celebrity from their team who would be eliminated from future games. Ant's team consisted of: Paul Daniels' wife [[Debbie McGee]]; actress and singer [[Bonnie Langford]]; dancer [[Wayne Sleep]]; [[Jason \"J\" Brown]] from [[Five (band)|Five]]; and ex-[[Steps (group)|Steps]] member [[Lee Latchford-Evans]] (due to \"personal reasons\" Ant's initial choice of [[Lee Ryan]] from [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]] could not take part as planned). Dec's team consisted of: magician [[Paul Daniels]]; singer [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]]; ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' contestant [[Chico Slimani]]; TV presenter [[Melinda Messenger]]; and former footballer [[Lee Sharpe]]. The contest between the teams ended on a draw of 3-3, leading to a tie-breaker game of a basketball shoot-out to be held in the final episode to determine the winner.

For this series, \"Beat the Boys\" was replaced by a new segment entitled \"Escape from Takeaway Prison\", which involved celebrities competing against each other in a series of games.\n\nFor this series' contest between the presenters, each were once more joined by a team of celebrities. Ant's team consisted of: former British politician [[Lembit \u00d6pik]]; comedian [[Brian Conley]]; singer and TV presenter [[Liz McClarnon]]; singer and TV presenter [[Jonathan Wilkes]]; and actress and TV presenter [[Yvette Fielding]]. Dec's team consisted of: former [[boy band]] [[Blue (English band)|Blue]] member [[Antony Costa]]; former British politician [[Edwina Currie]]; singer [[Sinitta]]; comedian [[Bobby Davro]]; and hair stylise [[Nicky Clarke]]. The contest ended on a draw of 3-3, leading to a tie-breaker game of tincan alley to be held in the final episode to determine the winner. For this game, each team took it in turns to knock down as many cans as they could, with one ball thrown by each presenter and the two remaining members of their team. The game was won by Dec's team, leading to the presenter winning this series' contest as a result. This segment featured a guest appearance by [[Brian Blessed]] during the second and final challenges.\nSponsorship: [[Birds Eye]].\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Sponsorship: Morrison\u2019s.\n\nFor this series' contest between the presenters, retained when ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' returned from its break, the format dropped the use of teams, and incorporated an element of the format from \"What's Next\", in that the presenters competed against each in games they had no idea about and thus had no rehearsal or practice time to prepare for. The segment was now presented by American singer [[Ashley Roberts]], replacing Gallacher, was aired in only five episodes of the series, and ended with Ant winning the contest for the first time, on a score of 3-2.\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This series is notable for two elements in its broadcast. The first was that its series finale took place outside the [[United Kingdom]], on the [[MV Britannia (2015)|MV Britannia]], while it was berthed in [[Barcelona]] - tickets for places on the cruise ship were offered during the other episodes as prizes, courtesy of the ship's operator [[P&O Cruises]] with tickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway|title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway 2016|publisher=ITV Press Centre|work=itv.com|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> The second was that it featured a live wedding in the sixth episode, between a couple who had written to the production team asking if they could be married on the programme.\n\nThe series introduced two new segments. The first, entitled \"Best Seats in the House\", offered places in the studio audience for the next episode, in a specially marked \"VIP\" section, with the exception of the first episode were the seats were given to selected members of the audience; for the penultimate episode, the viewers were given tickets for the cruise ship. The second involved a mini-serial \"whodunnit\" comedy drama entitled \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\", written by ''[[Broadchurch]]'' creator [[Chris Chibnall]], and starred [[Ant & Dec]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Louis Walsh]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], [[David Walliams]], [[Piers Morgan]], [[Olly Murs]], the late [[Caroline Flack]] and [[Ashleigh and Pudsey|Pudsey the Dog]] as themselves, and [[Kevin Whately]] and [[Emilia Fox]] as their respective characters from ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' and ''[[Silent Witness]]''. The mini-serial was later condensed into a single episode that was broadcast on 30 December 2017. Amongst the other segments for the show, the game \"Win the Ads\" received a minor change in its format, reducing the number of prizes that contestants could win in total, while final episode saw the game having the contestant chosen in the final episode was from those on the cruise ship, excluding anyone who won their place via ticket giveaway, and focusing on questions associated with being at sea.\n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured guest appearances by [[Kym Marsh]], [[Jane Danson]], [[Sally Dynevor]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Jack P. Shepherd]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Fleur East]], along with appearances by YouTubers [[Alfie Deyes]] and [[Marcus Butler]].

Like the previous series, the final episode took place outside of the United Kingdom, being broadcast live from [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], with tickets for places in that episode's audience being offered throughout the series. This series saw the introduction of two short-lived segments - \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and \"In For A Penny\" - while the segment \"Best Seat in the House\" was presented by [[Scarlett Moffatt]], after Roberts opted to not return to the show for a new series, and the stars of \"Little Ant & Dec\" now featured across the show and online, rather than in a dedicated segment. The game segment \"Win the Ads\" was also modified in this series, with it now featuring a viewer competition, in which those taking part competed against each other answered the same questions for a chance to win \u00a31,000; in the fourth and sixth episode, technical difficulties prevented the competition from being used.\n\nLike the previous series, a new mini-serial comedy drama was shown during this series broadcast, entitled \"The Missing Crown Jewels\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-01-26/ant-and-dec-reveal-details-of-saturday-night-takeaway-follow-up-to-who-shot-simon-cowell|title=Ant and Dec reveal details of Saturday Night Takeaway follow-up to Who Shot Simon Cowell?|publisher=}}</ref> starring [[Ant and Dec]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Cat Deeley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]], and which was later condensed into a single episode on 23 December 2017. [[Alfie Deyes]] & [[Marcus Butler]] didn\u2019t return after 1 series. This series also saw the introduction on an online game called \"Ant & Dec vs. YouTubers\", in which the presenters took on a pair of YouTubers on Wednesday during the series' broadcast, with filmed clips placed on the show's official [[YouTube]] channel. \n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured opening performances in a number of episodes by [[Robbie Williams]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Take That]], [[Louisa Johnson]], with the exception of the final episode in which the presenters performed a special rendition of the song ''[[Be Our Guest (Disney song)|Be Our Guest]]''. For \"Songalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Steps (group)|Steps]], [[Louisa Johnson]], [[CeeLo Green]], and was unique for a number of factors: one of the contestants who took part was [[Freddie Flintoff]], the episode's celebrity announcer, who was tasked with playing along in the game, with his success winning everyone in the studio audience tickets to the [[Steps (group)|Steps]]' comeback tour; for the sixth episode, the song used was \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", as a prize of a \"Place on the Plane\" for the series finale at Walt Disney World the following week was on offer in addition to the usual \u00a3500.

Like the previous series, the series finale took place outside of the UK at [[Universal Orlando|Universal Orlando Resort]] with tickets for places in this episode offered through the series, while it was the last series to be broadcast live from London Studios before its closure for redevelopment later in the year. This series saw \"Little Ant & Dec\" discontinued, owing to the production team deciding that the young actors for this segment had outgrown their roles and thus should be allowed to focus on their education, while \"Ant & Dec Undercover\" was restricted to just one episode, owing to the massive and complex amount of preparation done to film the segment. This series aired its 100th episode, which celebrated this milestone by featuring highlights from the last 99 episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', along with a one-off revival of the segment \"Home-Run\", and a special edition of \"Win the Ads\", hosted by [[Emma Willis]], in which the presenters tackled the game themselves on behalf of a studio audience member randomly chosen before the episode's broadcast.\n\nAs like the previous series, it features a mini-serial comedy drama entitled \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\", to be aired during the series' broadcast. The mini-serial features a large cast of celebrities: Ant & Dec, [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Olly Murs]], [[David Walliams]], [[Katie Price]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]].<!-- Add to this information on the mini-serial's cast, as it becomes available.--> Apart from the mini-serial, the series featured opening performances from [[Kylie Minogue]], [[George Ezra]], [[Paloma Faith]], as well as a special rendition of [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]] for the series finale. For \"Singalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[The Script]], and [[The Rembrandts]].<!-- Amend this line to focus on appearances for Opening Performances and Singalong Live respectively.-->\n\nThis series is notable for being affected greatly by the absence of [[Anthony McPartlin]] following the fourth episode, after he was involved in a traffic accident on 18 March 2018, connected to drink-driving, which led to him suspending further presenting duties the following day for the rest of the series and other programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463889|title= Ant McPartlin steps down from TV shows and seeks treatment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> As a direct result, it led to an episode that was planned for the 24 March 2018 to be cancelled by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and the discontinuation of \"Ant vs. Dec\" for the rest of the series. However, its most significant impact, was that it led to [[Declan Donnelly]] hosting the remaining two episodes by himself, the first time he had presented a programme in 30 years without McPartlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43487792|title=Dec to present Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> with his co-presenters [[Stephen Mulhern]] and [[Scarlett Moffatt]] receiving expanded roles in these episodes. Although absent, McPartlin appeared in these episodes but solely within the pre-recorded editions of the mini-serial \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\". The decision to continue the series after the incident had occurred was primarily down to the presenters and the production team choosing not to cancel tickets made out to people who had secured a place within the audience for the series finale in Florida.

It was also the first to be broadcast from their new home at [[Television Centre, London]] following the closure of [[The London Studios]] in 2018. [[Stephen Mulhern]] returned to host the ''Ant vs. Dec'' segment, which for this series had a \"global\" theme to all of the challenges. However, [[Scarlett Moffatt]] did not return to the show as she left to focus on other TV projects, and was not replaced.\n\nThis series saw a new mini-serial entitled ''Men in Brown'' starring Ant & Dec still serving as undercover agents for ''The Honoured'' and tasked with saving the world from an alien invasion. [[Phillip Schofield|Philip Schofield]], [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Emily Atack]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Love Island (2015 TV series, series 5)|Amber Gill]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Richard Ayoade]], [[Paddy McGuinness]], and [[Hugh Bonneville]] (replacing [[Emilia Fox]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] as the head of ''The Honoured'') are guest starring in the mini-serial.\n\nAnother new segment called ''Don't Feed the Pandas'', involved Ant & Dec dressing up in realistic prosthetic panda costumes in an attempt to fool school kids at [[London Zoo]]. Other features returning from the previous series include ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' and ''Undercover''. ''Win the Ads'' also returned with a minor tweak in its format, the viewers competition used in the previous two series was discontinued and instead, one of the 16 prizes on the board would be won not just by the contestant but for the entire studio audience as well.\n\nThe first ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' of the series was with American actor [[Mark Wahlberg]] at [[Wahlburgers|his London restaurant]] where he pranked members of the public with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The first \"End of the Show\" - Show marked the return of [[Ashley Roberts]] with [[The Pussycat Dolls]] to the show she left after Series 14 in 2017. The second ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was with British Boxer and \"[[List of world heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\" [[Anthony Joshua]] at his local boxing club where pranked three members of the public by saying that the were going to be his personal chief with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The third ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was done with British singer-songwriter and DJ [[Craig David]].  \n\n[[Andi Peters]] has been presenting the competition segment, which in the first episode was live from [[Bermuda, Warwickshire|Bermuda]], [[Nuneaton]], in the second episode was live from [[New York, Tyne and Wear|New York]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and in the fourth episode was live from [[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]], [[Derbyshire]]. He was back in the studio for episode five. In the second episode, [[Fleur East]] gave some tickets for a ''Place on the Plane'' to a winning family in [[Bristol]] and in the fourth episode Fleur East visited [[Kingston upon Hull]] where the family who guessed the restaurant correctly (which was Papas [[Fish and chip shop|Fish and Chips shop]] in Kingston upon Hull) won another ''Place on the Plane''. \n\nThe ''Place on the Plane'' giveaway was again announced on the first show of the series, with the series finale location revealed as [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] for the second time (having previously hosted the series finale in Series 14).
