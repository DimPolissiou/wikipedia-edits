First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Working as a young man for French merchants in Syria, Diyab learned French and Italian; according to Galland, he also had a knowledge of Proven\u00e7al and Turkish; it is also possible that, as a Maronite, he knew some Aramaic. Diyab briefly joined a Maronite monastery on [[Mount Lebanon]] as a [[Novitiate|novice]], but left. As he proceeded home, around the beginning of 1707, he met the Frenchman [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], who was on an expedition in search of antiquities on behalf of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Lucas invited Diyab to return with him to France, working as a servant, assistant and interpreter, suggesting that he might find work at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|Royal Library]] in Paris. Leaving Syria in February 1707, they visited Egypt, Tripoli, Tunisia, Corsica, Livorno, Genoa and Marseille, arriving in Paris early in 1708. Diyab was received with some excitement in Paris, partly because Lucas had him wear national dress and carry a cage containing two [[jerboa]]s from Tunisia. He met the King at [[Versailles]]. However, he tired of seeking preferment and returned to Aleppo in 1710.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\">Alastair Hamilton, review of Hanna Dy\u00e2b, ''D\u2019Alep \u00e0 Paris: Les p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations d\u2019un jeune syrien au temps de Louis XIV'', ed. and trans. by Paule Fahm\u00e9-Thi\u00e9ry, Bernard Heyberger, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lentin (Sindbad, 2015), ''Erudition and the Republic of Letters'', 1.4 (2016), 497\u201398, {{DOI|10.1163/24055069-00104006}}.</ref><ref name=\":1\">John-Paul Ghobrial, review of Hanna Dy\u00e2b, ''D\u2019Alep \u00e0 Paris: Les p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations d\u2019un jeune syrien au temps de Louis XIV'', ed. and trans. by Paule Fahm\u00e9-Thi\u00e9ry, Bernard Heyberger, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lentin (Sindbad, 2015), ''The English Historical Review'', volume 132, issue 554 (February 2017), 147\u201349, {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew417}}.</ref><ref>Ruth B.

Working as a young man for French merchants in Syria, Diyab learned French and Italian; according to Galland, he also had a knowledge of Proven\u00e7al and Turkish; it is also possible that, as a Maronite, he knew some Aramaic. Diyab briefly joined a Maronite monastery on [[Mount Lebanon]] as a [[Novitiate|novice]], but left. As he proceeded home, around the beginning of 1707, he met the Frenchman [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], who was on an expedition in search of antiquities on behalf of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Lucas invited Diyab to return with him to France, working as a servant, assistant and interpreter, suggesting that he might find work at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|Royal Library]] in Paris. Leaving Syria in February 1707, they visited Egypt, Tripoli, Tunisia, Corsica, Livorno, Genoa and Marseille, arriving in Paris early in 1708. Diyab was received with some excitement in Paris, partly because Lucas had him wear national dress and carry a cage containing two [[Jerboa|jerboas]] from Tunisia. He met the King at [[Versailles]]. However, he tired of seeking preferment and returned to Aleppo in 1710.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\">Alastair Hamilton, review of Hanna Dy\u00e2b, ''D\u2019Alep \u00e0 Paris: Les p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations d\u2019un jeune syrien au temps de Louis XIV'', ed. and trans. by Paule Fahm\u00e9-Thi\u00e9ry, Bernard Heyberger, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lentin (Sindbad, 2015), ''Erudition and the Republic of Letters'', 1.4 (2016), 497\u201398, {{DOI|10.1163/24055069-00104006}}.</ref><ref name=\":1\">John-Paul Ghobrial, review of Hanna Dy\u00e2b, ''D\u2019Alep \u00e0 Paris: Les p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations d\u2019un jeune syrien au temps de Louis XIV'', ed. and trans. by Paule Fahm\u00e9-Thi\u00e9ry, Bernard Heyberger, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lentin (Sindbad, 2015), ''The English Historical Review'', volume 132, issue 554 (February 2017), 147\u201349, {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew417}}.</ref><ref>Ruth B.

Some destroy themselves in a fit of insanity, while others commit sins to fulfill their desires. They become trapped in a vicious cycle of suffering, reinforcing the theme of fate in Han's works.\n\nOne of Han's best-known works is the novella ''Hyebyeonui gilson'' (\ud574\ubcc0\uc758 \uae38\uc190 Wanderer on the Shore), which is loosely based on an ancient Korean hero myth. The book spans decades from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]] through the chaotic post-liberation period to the [[Korean War]], modernization, and finally the [[Gwangju Uprising]] in the 1980s. The turmoils of modern Korean history is reflected in the tragic life of the protagonist Hwang Du-pyo. In a storyline reminiscent of [[Cain and Abel]], the novel centers around the conflict between Hwang and his little brother, who is smarter and more loved by their parents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?nNewsNumb=201209100059|title=\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ub300\ud45c \ubb38\ud559\uc0c1 \uc218\uc0c1\uc791\uac00\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\uc11c \u2460 \u97d3\u52dd\u6e90|website=monthly.chosun.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-12-03}}</ref> Literary critic Wu Han-yong writes: \u201cThe tragedy of Hwang Du-pyo\u2019s family originates from his inferiority complex and is correlated to Korean modern history; the tragedy of an individual expands into that of the nation. Another way to understand the novel is to focus on the psychology of its characters. In this kind of reading, one sees how Hwang\u2019s bitter sense of inferiority grows as he experiences the tumults of history and how that compromises his integrity.\u201d<ref>Han-yong Wu, \u201c\ud574\uc124: \uc0dd\uba85\uacfc \uc790\uc720\uc758\uc9c0\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ud615\uc0c1,\u201d in ''\ud574\ubcc0\uc758 \uae38\uc190 \uc678'', Han Seung-won (Donga, 1995), 502.</ref>\n\nOften set in his coastal hometown of Jangheung County, Han's stories have a strong sense of place.

She was a visible [[lesbian]] [[political activism|political activist]], during an era when few who were unconnected to the [[lesbian community]] were aware of [[Homosexual|Gay]] and [[Lesbian]] issues. Williamson's music and insight has served as a catalyst for change in the creation of women-owned [[record companies]] in the 1970s. Using her musical talents, networking with other \nartists working in [[Women's music]], and her willingness to represent those who did not yet feel safe in speaking for themselves, Williamson is credited by many in the [[LGBT]] community for her contributions, both artistically, and politically, and continues to be a [[role model]] for a younger generation hoping to address concerns and obtain recognition for achievements specific to people who have historically been ignored.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nWilliamson was born in 1947 in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]],<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cris-williamson-p5964/biography |title=Cris Williamson |publisher=AllMusic |date=2005-12-15 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref> although her family moved to [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] when she was still young. Her musical idol at the time was [[Judy Collins]], and Williamson developed a musical style and sound that was similar to that of Collins. She released her first album, ''The Artistry of Cris Williamson'' in 1964, when she was sixteen.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> She became a local musical sensation in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], releasing two following [[LP album|LP]]s afterward.<ref name=\"glbtq\">[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/williams_on_c.html  Cris Williamson: Encyclopedia of Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418014338/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/williams_on_c.html |date=2008-04-18 }}</ref> Williamson graduated from the [[University of Denver]]. She supported herself initially as a [[schoolteacher|school teacher]],<ref name=\"Featured Performer\">May 12, 2007 [http://www.muuf.org/WomensFestival.html#Performer 17th Annual Morristown Women's Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108185754/http://muuf.org/WomensFestival.html#Performer#Performer |date=2012-11-08 }}</ref> while at the same time collaborating with other women who were also [[singing|singer]]-[[songwriters]] and performing artists, and began to network with [[Holly Near]], [[Meg Christian]], and [[Margie Adam]], all musicians who became women artists of stature, forming an entirely new [[genre]] of music, primarily about and for women.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Olivia Records===\nDuring a radio interview in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1973, Williamson suggested that a record label aimed at gay women would be a good idea. The [[Indie (music)|independent]] label [[Olivia Records]] was founded the next day.<ref name=allmusic /> Olivia Records released Williamson's ''The Changer and the Changed'' (1975), which became one of the best-selling independent releases of all time.<ref name=\"Garofalo\">Garofalo, Reebee (1992) ''Rockin' the Boat'', p. 245 [[South End Press]] {{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}</ref> ''The Changer and the Changed'' was also the first LP to be entirely produced by women, and is the all-time best-selling album to come out of the [[women's music]] genre. As William Ruhlmann of ''[[AllMusic]]'' writes:\n\n:\"''The Changer and the Changed'' was to [[women's music]] what [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' was to the music industry in general in the mid-'80s, an album that sold far beyond the perceived size of the market, more than 100,000 copies in its first year of release. Eventually, it reportedly sold more than 500,000 copies, which would make it a gold album, although it has not been certified as such by the RIAA. (That does not disprove the sales estimate, however. Albums are not certified automatically; a record company must request certification and pay for an audit.)\" <ref name=allmusic />\n\nWilliamson went on to record more than a dozen more albums with Olivia Records, then after its demise formed her own label, Wolf Moon Records. This helped to set the pace for other recording artists who found it difficult to work with the [[major record labels]].\n\nIn 1982, she collaborated with Estonian artist/author Viido Polikarpus on a science fiction/fantasy fable LP and book (with Polikarpos' artwork) entitled ''Lumiere'', which was released on Pacific Cascade Records.\n\n===Personal life===\n\nWilliamson recorded two albums with her long-time [[Record producer|producer]] and [[Sexual partner|lover]], [[Tret Fure]]. Williamson and Fure ended their 20-year relationship in 2000, and each now records as a solo artist.<ref name=\"Kort\">Kort, Michelle (accessed July 15, 2007) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2000_August_15/ai_63692919 Dated August 15, 2000 ''The Advocate'' \"The Changer and the Changed\"]</ref>\n\nWilliamson has worked as a [[session musician]] both to support herself and to lend assistance to other fellow artists.

She was a visible [[lesbian]] [[political activism|political activist]], during an era when few who were unconnected to the [[lesbian community]] were aware of [[Homosexual|Gay]] and [[Lesbian]] issues. Williamson's music and insight has served as a catalyst for change in the creation of women-owned [[record companies]] in the 1970s. Using her musical talents, networking with other \nartists working in [[Women's music]], and her willingness to represent those who did not yet feel safe in speaking for themselves, Williamson is credited by many in the [[LGBT]] community for her contributions, both artistically, and politically, and continues to be a [[role model]] for a younger generation hoping to address concerns and obtain recognition for achievements specific to people who have historically been ignored.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nWilliamson was born in 1947 in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]],<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cris-williamson-p5964/biography |title=Cris Williamson |publisher=AllMusic |date=2005-12-15 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref> although her family moved to [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] when she was still young. Her musical idol at the time was [[Judy Collins]], and Williamson developed a musical style and sound that was similar to that of Collins. She released her first album, ''The Artistry of Cris Williamson'' in 1964, when she was sixteen.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> She became a local musical sensation in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], releasing two following [[LP album|LP]]s afterward.<ref name=\"glbtq\">[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/williams_on_c.html  Cris Williamson: Encyclopedia of Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418014338/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/williams_on_c.html |date=2008-04-18 }}</ref> Williamson graduated from the [[University of Denver]].

The [[Indie (music)|independent]] label [[Olivia Records]] was founded the next day.<ref name=allmusic /> Olivia Records released Williamson's ''The Changer and the Changed'' (1975), which became one of the best-selling independent releases of all time.<ref name=\"Garofalo\">Garofalo, Reebee (1992) ''Rockin' the Boat'', p. 245 [[South End Press]] {{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}</ref> ''The Changer and the Changed'' was also the first LP to be entirely produced by women, and is the all-time best-selling album to come out of the [[women's music]] genre. As William Ruhlmann of ''[[AllMusic]]'' writes:\n\n:\"''The Changer and the Changed'' was to [[women's music]] what [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' was to the music industry in general in the mid-'80s, an album that sold far beyond the perceived size of the market, more than 100,000 copies in its first year of release. Eventually, it reportedly sold more than 500,000 copies, which would make it a gold album, although it has not been certified as such by the RIAA. (That does not disprove the sales estimate, however. Albums are not certified automatically; a record company must request certification and pay for an audit.)\" <ref name=allmusic />\n\nWilliamson went on to record more than a dozen more albums with Olivia Records, then after its demise formed her own label, Wolf Moon Records. This helped to set the pace for other recording artists who found it difficult to work with the [[major record labels]].\n\nIn 1982, she collaborated with Estonian artist/author Viido Polikarpus on a science fiction/fantasy fable LP and book (with Polikarpos' artwork) entitled ''Lumiere'', which was released on Pacific Cascade Records.\n\n===Personal life===\n\nWilliamson recorded two albums with her long-time [[Record producer|producer]] and [[Sexual partner|lover]], [[Tret Fure]]. Williamson and Fure ended their 20-year relationship in 2000, and each now records as a solo artist.<ref name=\"Kort\">Kort, Michelle (accessed July 15, 2007) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2000_August_15/ai_63692919 Dated August 15, 2000 ''The Advocate'' \"The Changer and the Changed\"]</ref>\n\nWilliamson has worked as a [[session musician]] both to support herself and to lend assistance to other fellow artists.

She wrote a four-volume best seller, ''Daughter of the Wind: Three and a Half Times Around the Globe on Foot,'' an account of her seven-year (1993\u20131999) travels around the world. Han had quit a profitable and high-status job at [[Burson-Marsteller]], a global public relations and communications firm, and jumped into what she liked most.<ref>{{cite web\n|author     = Seo Hyun-jin\n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Han Bi-ya embarks on new journey for refugee relief \n|url        = http://www.unhcr.or.kr/admin/Hicalsum/article_board/index.php?popup=&mode=content&num=55&readnum=1032&op_admin=&std_id=\n|publisher  = [[The Korea Herald]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nHan explored the world, especially many isolated regions, alone and on foot, rarely taking flights. Also, her explorations were not like ordinary trips in that she actually stayed in local people's home as many times as possible and truly experienced the local culture. In some countries like [[Afghanistan]], it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous, especially for a woman, to talk to a local man and stay in his home. In the book, Han states that she put herself in hazardous situations and was fortunate to survive. These adventurous and vivid stories fascinate readers.\n\nHer travel inspired her to devote her life to helping refugees as a volunteer worker. During her ventures to the world, Han Bi-ya experienced the awakening moment. She realized that the world is not a [[Global village (term)|Global Village]], but a \"Global House\".<ref>{{cite web\n|author  = Seo Hyun-jin \n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Han Bi-ya embarks on new journey for refugee relief \n|url        = http://www.unhcr.or.kr/admin/Hicalsum/article_board/index.php?popup=&mode=content&num=55&readnum=1032&op_admin=&std_id=\n|publisher  = [[The Korea Herald]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Han Bi-ya has said that she would no longer travel, even though travel led her to discover the meaning of her life.

She has been active in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central and South America. Han Bi-ya said that her refugee relief activities have helped her realize the urgent need to develop diverse mechanisms for preventing wars and conflicts around the world. She hopes she can come up with an idea to deal with international affairs in the future through the experiences in relief activities.\n\nHer book, ''March to the World, Off the Map'' explains several sadness and smiles upon her work around the world. Recently, she appeared on one TV show to explain her joy and life of work. At the show, she became the first person to explain the ceremony of [[circumcision]] to viewers of Korea, held widely in Africa as a rite of passage.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nHan Bi-ya has said that \"The happiest person is someone who is on the spot, doing what he or she really wants to do and braveness comes when you don't have fear in trying something, and the degree of braveness varies according to how eagerly you wish to do it.

She studied [[English literature]] at [[Hongik University]] and completed graduate studies at the [[University of Utah]].

She wrote a four-volume best seller, ''Daughter of the Wind: Three and a Half Times Around the Globe on Foot,'' an account of her seven-year (1993\u20131999) travels around the world. Han had quit a profitable and high-status job at [[Burson-Marsteller]], a global public relations and communications firm, and jumped into what she liked most.<ref>{{cite web\n|author     = Seo Hyun-jin\n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Han Bi-ya embarks on new journey for refugee relief \n|url        = http://www.unhcr.or.kr/admin/Hicalsum/article_board/index.php?popup=&mode=content&num=55&readnum=1032&op_admin=&std_id=\n|publisher  = [[The Korea Herald]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nHan explored the world, especially many isolated regions, alone and on foot, rarely taking flights. Also, her explorations were not like ordinary trips in that she actually stayed in local people's home as many times as possible and truly experienced the local culture. In some countries like [[Afghanistan]], it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous, especially for a woman, to talk to a local man and stay in his home. In the book, Han states that she put herself in hazardous situations and was fortunate to survive. These adventurous and vivid stories fascinate readers.\n\nHer travel inspired her to devote her life to helping refugees as a volunteer worker. During her ventures to the world, Han Bi-ya experienced the awakening moment. She realized that the world is not a [[Global village (term)|Global Village]], but a \"Global House\".<ref>{{cite web\n|author  = Seo Hyun-jin \n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Han Bi-ya embarks on new journey for refugee relief \n|url        = http://www.unhcr.or.kr/admin/Hicalsum/article_board/index.php?popup=&mode=content&num=55&readnum=1032&op_admin=&std_id=\n|publisher  = [[The Korea Herald]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Han Bi-ya has said that she would no longer travel, even though travel led her to discover the meaning of her life.

She has been active in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central and South America. Han Bi-ya said that her refugee relief activities have helped her realize the urgent need to develop diverse mechanisms for preventing wars and conflicts around the world. She hopes she can come up with an idea to deal with international affairs in the future through the experiences in relief activities.\n\nHer book, ''March to the World, Off the Map'' explains several sadness and smiles upon her work around the world. Recently, she appeared on one TV show to explain her joy and life of work. At the show, she became the first person to explain the ceremony of [[circumcision]] to viewers of Korea, held widely in Africa as a rite of passage.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nHan Bi-ya has said that \"The happiest person is someone who is on the spot, doing what he or she really wants to do and braveness comes when you don't have fear in trying something, and the degree of braveness varies according to how eagerly you wish to do it. If you find a thing which you think you can die for, nothing can stop you.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|author     = Seo Hyun-jin\n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Han Bi-ya embarks on new journey for refugee relief \n|url        = http://www.unhcr.or.kr/admin/Hicalsum/article_board/index.php?popup=&mode=content&num=55&readnum=1032&op_admin=&std_id=\n|publisher  = [[The Korea Herald]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}\n</ref>\n\nHan Bi-ya added that she followed her own \"timetable for life,\" without comparing it with others. She tries whatever she likes at any age.\n\nHan Bi-ya has been a very influential and heroic figure for young people in Korea. Many young women have started to go on backpacking trips, following her routes.<ref>{{cite web\n|author     = Kim Gi-Cheol\n|date       = 20 February 2002\n|title      = Editor's letter- The Daughter of Wind, Han Bi-ya\n|url        = http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/10/26/2007102601321.html\n|publisher  = [[Chosun Ilbo]]\n|accessdate = 28 May 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nHan gives a valuable lesson to the young on helping others in the world, and making a better world together.
