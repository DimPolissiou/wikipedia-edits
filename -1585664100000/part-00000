It consists of two [[metal]] plates separated by granules of [[carbon]]. One plate is very thin and faces toward the speaking person, acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]].  [[Sound wave]]s striking the diaphragm cause it to vibrate, exerting a varying [[pressure]] on the granules, which in turn changes the [[electrical resistance]] between the plates.  Higher pressure lowers the resistance as the granules are pushed closer together.  A steady [[direct current]] is passed between the plates through the granules.  The varying resistance results in a [[modulation]] of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.  In [[telephony]], this undulating current is directly passed through the telephone wires to the [[telephone exchange|central office]]. In [[public address]] systems it is amplified by an [[audio amplifier]].  The [[frequency response]] of most carbon microphones, however, are limited to a narrow range, and the device produces significant [[electrical noise]].\n\nBefore the proliferation of [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers in the 1920s, carbon microphones were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals. They were widely used in telephone systems until the 1980s, while other applications used different microphone designs much earlier. Their low cost, inherently high output and frequency response characteristic were well suited for telephony. For [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS), carbon-microphone based telephones can still be used without modification. Carbon microphones, usually modified telephone transmitters, were widely used in early [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] systems, but their limited frequency response, as well as a fairly high noise level, led to their abandonment in those applications by the late 1920s.

In the first long-distance [[sound|audio]] transmissions by [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1906, a [[continuous wave]] from an [[Alexanderson alternator]] was fed directly to the transmitting antenna through a water-cooled carbon microphone.

This can readily be demonstrated by connecting a battery, microphone and earphone in series. If the microphone and earphone are brought in contact the system will oscillate. This is only possible if the power gain around the loop is greater than unity. \nThe microphone's low-voltage performance is particularly useful in remote locations served by very long telephone lines, where the electrical resistance of the wires can lead to severe DC voltage drop.  Most all-electronic telephones need at least three volts DC to work, and so will often become useless in such situations, whereas carbon transmitter telephones will continue to work down to a fraction of a volt.  Even where they do work, electronic telephones also suffer from the so-called \"[[cliff effect]]\", whereby they abruptly stop working when the line voltage falls below the critical level.  In particular, this means that one telephone on a \"[[Party line (telephony)|party line]]\" may tend to \"hog\" all the [[electrical current|line current]], cutting the others off.  With carbon microphones, all receivers on the same line will still operate, albeit with [[current divider|reduced output]].\n\nCarbon microphones are also widely used in safety-critical applications such as [[mining]] and [[chemical manufacturing]], where higher line voltages cannot be used, due to the risk of sparking and consequent [[explosion]]s. Carbon-based telephone systems are also resistant to damage from high-[[voltage transient]]s, such as those produced by [[lightning]] strikes, and [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of the type generated by [[nuclear explosion]]s, and so are still maintained as backup communication systems in critical military installations.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Josephson, Matthew, ''Edison: A Biography'', Wiley, 1992, {{ISBN|0-471-54806-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Carbon microphones}}\n* [https://archive.is/20130416122912/http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/biography/Edison/chap36.html Edison's invention of the carbon (graphite) microphone] by Frank Dyer\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0474230}} ''Speaking Telegraph'' (graphite microphone), filed April 1877, issued May 1892\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0203016}} ''Improvement in Speaking Telephones'' (compressed lamp black button insulated from diaphragm), filed March 1878, issued  April, 1878\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0222390}} ''Carbon Telephone'' (carbon granules microphone), filed Nov 1878, issued Dec 1879\n* E.

Keller was frustrated, at first, because she did not understand that every object had a word uniquely identifying it. In fact, when Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for \"mug\", Keller became so frustrated she broke the mug.<ref name=\"Wilkie\">{{cite book| last=Wilkie| first=Katherine E.| title=Helen Keller: Handicapped Girl| publisher=Atheneum| date=January 1969| isbn=978-0-672-50076-3}}</ref> But soon she began imitating Sullivan's hand gestures. \u201cI did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed,\u201d Keller remembered. \u201cI was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Helen Keller\u2019s Moment|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/11/29/helen-kellers-moment |website=The Attic|accessdate=1  February 2019}}</ref>\n\nKeller's breakthrough in communication came the next month, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of \"water\". Writing in her autobiography, ''The Story of My Life,'' Keller recalled the moment: \"I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten \u2014 a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me.

It was the beginning of a nearly 50-year-long relationship during which Sullivan evolved into Keller's [[governess]] and eventually her [[lady's companion|companion]].<ref name=\"mylife\"/>\n\nSullivan arrived at Keller's house on March 5, 1887, a day Keller would forever remember as ''my soul's birthday.''<ref name=\"Helen Keller's Moment\"/>  Sullivan immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with \"d-o-l-l\" for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller was frustrated, at first, because she did not understand that every object had a word uniquely identifying it. In fact, when Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for \"mug\", Keller became so frustrated she broke the mug.<ref name=\"Wilkie\">{{cite book| last=Wilkie| first=Katherine E.| title=Helen Keller: Handicapped Girl| publisher=Atheneum| date=January 1969| isbn=978-0-672-50076-3}}</ref> But soon she began imitating Sullivan's hand gestures. \u201cI did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed,\u201d Keller remembered. \u201cI was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Helen Keller\u2019s Moment|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/11/29/helen-kellers-moment |website=The Attic|accessdate=1  February 2019}}</ref>\n\nKeller's breakthrough in communication came the next month, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of \"water\". Writing in her autobiography, ''The Story of My Life,'' Keller recalled the moment: \"I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten \u2014 a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me.
