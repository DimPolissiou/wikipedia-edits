{"title_page": "Terminator (character concept)", "text_new": "{{About|the character concept|the eponymous character|Terminator (character)}}\n{{In-universe|date = November 2019}}\n[[File:terminator1001.jpg|thumb|300px|A Terminator endoskeleton seen in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.]]\n\nIn the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' film series]], a '''Terminator''' is an autonomous [[cyborg]], typically humanoid, originally conceived as a virtually indestructible [[soldier]], [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrator]], and [[Assassination|assassin\n\nAccording to the first two films, Terminators were Cyberdyne Systems models created after the war between man and machines started. In the altered timeline of ''Terminator 3'' created by the destruction of Cyberdyne in ''Terminator 2'', Terminators were created by [[Cyber Research Systems]] (CRS), starting with the T-1.\n\nA scene shot for the ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (video game)|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' video game explains the origins of the Terminators as a project by CRS, which obtained patents from Cyberdyne. According to the scene, a [[Chief Master Sergeant]] named William Candy (played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) was chosen to be the model for the Terminator project, although his thick [[Southern American English|Southern US accent]] would later be replaced by one sounding like Schwarzenegger's. The scene is also included on the ''Terminator 3'' DVD as a deleted scene.\n\n===Construction===\nAs seen in the movies, a Terminator can withstand standard 20th century firearms, crash through walls intact, and survive explosions to some degree. Repeated shotgun blasts have enough force to knock it down and temporarily disable it, while heavy amounts of automatic fire are able to compromise the organic disguise layer. In the second film, the Terminator says it can run for 120 years on its existing power cells. Near the end of ''Terminator 2'', its power source is damaged, but is able to find an alternate source, described on the DVD commentary as [[heat sink]]s, harnessing the thermal energy from the hot surroundings. In the third film, the T-101 Terminator operates on two hydrogen cells and discards one of them early due to damage. It explodes shortly thereafter with enough force to produce a small [[mushroom cloud]]; the fact that many of them are powered by nuclear fuel cells (miniaturized [[fusion reactor]]s) is confirmed by the [[Terminator Salvation|fourth film]].\n\nThe [[endoskeleton]] is actuated by a powerful network of electric [[servomechanism]]s, making Terminators [[superhuman strength|superhumanly strong]]. For instance, in the third movie, Schwarzenegger's character was able to break through a cement wall, while being able to handle firing a [[machine gun]] from the hip with one hand, while holding a coffin containing John Connor and a heavy cache of weapons, showing no signs of the extra weight being any real concern; in the second film, Schwarzenegger's character was able to resist the recoil of firing a [[minigun]] without any noticeable difficulty. Late in the first film, the Terminator is stripped of its organic elements by fire. What remains is the machine itself, in James Cameron's own words \"a chrome skeleton\", \"like [[Death (personification)|Death]] rendered in steel.\" In the later ''Terminator'' films, armies of endoskeleton-only Terminators are seen. They are visually identical to the one in the first film, and feature prominently in the \"future war\" sequences of those films. In the television series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'', [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]] establishes that modern Terminators are made of [[coltan]] for heat resistance, while previous models were made of [[titanium]].\n\nDespite Kyle Reese's claim in the first film that \"cyborgs do not feel pain,\" it is said in the second film that they are capable of sensing injuries and that \"the data could be called pain\", according to the Model 101. In an episode of ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', \"Mr. Ferguson Is Ill Today,\" another android, Cameron, is revealed to have an intolerance to some degrees of temperature in its surrounding, as humans do. Unlike humans, however, being machines, they are capable of resisting or shutting off this sense of discomfort. In the following episode, \"Complications\", Cameron elaborates that Terminators can appreciate physical sensations such as the wind blowing through its hair and toes, and process them in a psychological manner.\n\n''Terminator Genisys'' reveals that a Terminator's endoskeleton's efficiency will deteriorate due to age, therefore, eventually the android will encounter physical limitations.\n\nA trait persistent throughout the series is the faint red glow of the \"robotic eyes\" when online, which fade out when a Terminator shuts down. In all five movies, the lack of the glow has been used to show when one is out of action. The trait is so characteristic that light-up eyes are often found on ''Terminator'' merchandise,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hottoys.com.hk/product.php?cat=22&pid=259 |title=The Terminator - Endoskeleton |publisher=HotToys |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421002348/http://www.hottoys.com.hk/product.php?cat=22&pid=259 |archivedate=2009-04-21}}</ref> with some even replicating the dimming/reillumination effect that occurs during shut down or start up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=8333 |title=T-800 Endoskeleton |publisher=Sideshowtoy.com |accessdate=2011-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807082556/https://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=8333 |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[T-X]] Terminator has blue glowing eyes instead of red.\n\n===CPU and programming===\nThe Terminator [[Central processing unit|CPU]] is a [[room-temperature superconductor|room-temperature superconducting]] [[artificial neural network]] with [[machine learning|the ability to learn]].<ref>'''Tarisa:''' \"It's a neural-net processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature.\" ''[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Terminator-2-Judgement-Day.html (Terminator 2: Judgment Day Script)]''</ref> In ''Terminator 2'', The Terminator states that \"the more contact [it] has with humans, the more [it] learns.\" In the Special Edition, he says that Skynet \"presets the switch to '[[read-only memory|read-only]]' when [terminators] are sent out alone\", to prevent them from \"thinking too much\" (In ''Terminator Genisys'', Skynet tells John Connor that the Human Resistance only \"defeated an army of slaves\"). Sarah and John activate his learning ability, after which it becomes more curious and begins trying to understand and imitate human behavior. This leads to his use of the [[catch phrase]] \"[[Hasta la vista, baby]].\" At the end of ''Terminator 2'', the Model 101 says: \"I know now why you cry, but it is something that I can never do.\" Sarah muses in the closing narration that the Terminator had \"learn[ed] the value of human life\". In ''Terminator Genisys'', when a Terminator's learning capability is enabled after a long period, it becomes fully capable of acquiring knowledge and performing problem solving through [[reason]] based on whatever it learns. \n\nTerminators, being machines, are typically believed by humans to not have emotions. According to Reese, Terminators \"can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with and [don't] feel pity or remorse or fear.\" Terminators also do not value life, and pragmatically kill in keeping with their programming, i.e. to fulfill their mission. In ''Terminator 2'', when John Connor realizes that the Model 101 was about to kill a man they encountered, it responds \"of course, I'm a Terminator.\"  Conversely, when discussing a variation on the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' '[[Voight-Kampff machine|tortoise test]]' in ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, \"Complications\", Cameron states that a tortoise did not pose a threat and \"We are not programmed to be cruel,\" implying that Terminators would right an overturned tortoise. Terminators in the films and TV series have displayed ruthless brutality in achieving their goals, but because they do not have emotions, they are not needlessly sadistic. Terminators can torture humans, but these are interrogations for information, used as a means to an end. Moreover, this means that Terminators are not very experienced at complex forms of interrogation:  for example, the T-1000 stabbed Sarah Connor through the shoulder and demanded that she call to John, but this was a simplistic application of pain.  Terminators can be taught more complicated torture tactics by humans, who are more familiar with sadistic torture - for example, the engineer/criminal [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#F|Charles Fischer]] - as shown in \"Complications\". However, in the fifth film ''Terminator Genisys'' , a T-800 develops a fatherly love for a young Sarah Connor, and in the sixth film ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'', set in another timeline, another T-800 is capable of expressing affections towards its human family, and of being remorseful over its killing of John Connor and seeks atonement. Terminators built by another AI, Legion, are apparently all capable of having emotions and other behaviors, evident by a [[Rev-9]]'s actions.  \n\nTerminators appear incapable of [[suicide|\"self termination\"]]. In ''Terminator 2'', the badly damaged Terminator states this to Sarah before asking her to lower it into molten steel, so that its chip cannot be used to create Skynet. To prevent the possible reprogramming of defeated Terminators, as the television series ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode \"The Tower Is Tall But The Fall Is Short\" reveals, Skynet coats later chips with a phosphorus compound which cause them to self-destruct when they contact oxygen.\n\nWhile a Terminator apparently cannot commit suicide as such, its programming does not stop it from sacrificing itself if the success of its mission is thereby ensured. In the third movie, the T-101 deliberately ruptures its own fuel cell next to its antagonist, the [[T-X]], causing an explosion destroying them both.\n\n==Typology==\n===Humanoid===\nGuardian Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]] states to [[John Connor]], in ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' episode \"The Mousetrap\", that Terminators' densities deny them the ability to swim.  T-888 [[Cromartie (Terminator)|Cromartie]] demonstrated in the same episode, however, that they can survive submerged and walk along the bed to the shore. The opening sequence of \"[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]\" portrays T-800s emerging from a beach in this fashion. The prototype Terminator Marcus Wright in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' did demonstrate the ability to swim, though he is the only one of his type. This ability was first seen in the [[List of Terminator comics|''Terminator'' comics]] by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]].\n\n====Flesh-bound endoskeleton====\nThe flesh covering that is used on the majority of Terminator models has similar qualities to real human [[muscle fibre|muscle fiber]] and [[dermis]], including [[soft tissue]] and skin, as well as the ability to sweat, simulate breathing and produce realistic body odor.<ref>As mentioned by Kyle Reese in ''[[The Terminator]]''.</ref> This also makes the Terminator vulnerable to age, as seen in ''Terminator Genisys''. Although Terminator flesh does contain blood, it only displays minimal bleeding when damaged and has never been shown to experience any kind of profuse bleeding, even from massive lacerations and dozens of gunshot wounds. It is unknown what manner of circulatory system, if any, is employed, nor what biological processes take place to sustain the flesh covering since T-800's do not eat food. At least some Terminator models can consume Food. Cameron eats a corn chip in the [[Pilot (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|''Sarah Connor Chronicles'' pilot]], and later a piece of a pancake. The liquid metal [[T-1001]] is also shown to have this capability. The T-888s presumably consume food, given Vick Chamberlain's ability to maintain a human cover for years while married to a human woman. The organic covering was developed for the 800 series, and was its unique feature when first introduced. In the first film, Kyle Reese states that the 600 series were covered in rubber skin, which proved unconvincing and made them easy to spot. Simple humanoid Hunter-Killers (HKs) share the endoskeletons and combat characteristics with infiltrators, but not the living tissue sheath. Instead, they serve as general infantry.\n\nUnder 2007-era analysis Terminator blood is shown to be similar to human blood, using a [[Blood substitutes|synthetic oxygen carrier]] rather than human [[red blood cell]]s, as Terminator endoskeletons contain no [[bone marrow]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 3: \"The Turk\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]</ref> Terminator flesh heals by itself,<ref>According to the Terminator, when asked by Sarah Connor in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.</ref> and at a much faster rate than normal human tissue<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[Heavy Metal (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|Episode 4: \"Heavy Metal\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]</ref> and has never been shown to bruise or discolor from trauma, even after several days. However, a Terminator's flesh covering can die if it sustains adequately massive damage, at which point it takes on a waxy, corpse-like pallor and begins to decompose. This process is seen in the later scenes of the original film where the Terminator, holed up in his hotel room, is attracting flies and draws an inquiry from the [[janitor]] as to whether the smell is coming from a dead animal. More advanced flesh used on T-888s appears to not suffer the effects of age or deprivation,  as shown in the ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, \"Self Made Man,\" where a T-888 known as [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Myron Stark|Myron Stark]] is able to maintain his organic covering while sealed within a wall for eighty years; no explanation for this ability was provided. Terminator flesh lacerations can be repaired; the Model 101 and Sarah Connor closed each other's wounds with sutures in ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', and Cameron sealed her wounds with heavy duty staples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode \"Samson and Delilah\".\n\nAlthough clearly not the normal procedure, a bare [[Cromartie (Terminator)|T-888]] endoskeleton was able to grow itself a new flesh covering using 2007 technology (with the assistance of a geneticist and its own knowledge of future formula) by submerging itself in a blood-like [[bathing|bath]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This improvised process resulted in a deformed covering that had the appearance of a burn victim and lacked its own biological [[human eye|eye]]s, requiring it to steal those of the [[geneticist]] and subsequently undergo [[cosmetic surgery]] to produce a more normal appearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that Terminators' flesh coverings are somehow grown identically, producing many copies of exactly the same physical appearance. This includes the Terminator portrayed by Schwarzenegger throughout the film series. In ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', a T-888 model known as \"Vick Chamberlain\" has a memory of facing a room (presumably in the factory where it was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to itself, naked and moving in unison.<ref>''[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 8, \"Vick's Chip\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']].</ref> Some Terminators' outer coverings are custom-designed to copy the appearances of humans whom they are intended to kill and replace. Three such examples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' include [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Carl Greenway|Carl Greenway]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Automatic for the People\"]], [[James Ellison (Terminator)|James Ellison]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Brothers of Nablus\"]] and Cameron's pattern, [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Allison Young|Allison Young]], in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Allison from Palmdale\"]] and [[Born to Run (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|\"Born to Run\"]].\n\nThe organic covering is expanded upon a bit more in ''Terminator Genisys''. There it is shown that a T-800 that has been in the past for eleven years has had its organic covering age to match. Kyle Reese expresses surprise at this, and Sarah Connor explains that the covering is like normal human skin and ages like it too, and thus its flesh wears and tears in the same rate as humans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resistance: The Guardian |url=http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=guardian&content=shoulder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120235724/http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=guardian&content=shoulder |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-20 |website=Terminator Genisys |publisher=Skedance }}</ref> The same T-800 is shown to have aged even further to have white hair and more wrinkles in 2017, thirty-three years later. It is also revealed that a T-800 can regrow a damaged organic covering, though it takes time. It is unknown whether this can be done if the covering is completely destroyed or it needs some covering to regrow from. The T-800 told Sarah that its damaged facial and arm covering would take years to regrow after exposure to acid.\n\n====Nanorobotic====\nThe [[T-3000]] ([[Jason Clarke]]) uses nanorobotics in a similar shapeshifting capacity as the T-1000; however, it is not a liquid metal being. The T-5000 ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) has the ability to convert a living organism into a nanorobotic T-3000 Terminator at the cellular level. The new T-3000 Terminator keeps the appearance of its original organic form and retains its host's memories and behavioral characteristics (see [[posthuman]]/[[technological singularity]]).\n\n'''[[Mimetic]] polyalloy''' is a fictional type of \"[[liquid metal]]\", described as an [[amorphous]] [[alloy]] that is twice the [[tensile strength]] of [[titanium]], and composed entirely from microscopic [[nanites]]. It uniquely combines the strength of forging with the ability to mold intricate and complex parts in one step. This allows some Terminator models (such as the [[T-1000]], [[T-1001]], [[T-X]], T-360 and [[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time #Production|T-1000000]]) to rapidly recover from damage, to quickly shapeshift [[camouflage]], or to achieve near-perfect [[mimicry]].\n\nThe T-1000 and T-1001 models, which are composed entirely of the substance, can quickly liquefy and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing their arms into solid metal shapes or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars, and flattening themselves on the ground to hide or ambush targets.<ref name=\"scifiscripts.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/t2.txt |title=Terminator2: Judgement Day |publisher=Scifiscripts.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> It can also extrude small, simple items from itself (such as a pair of sunglasses). It can change its color and texture to simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. They are effectively impervious to mechanical damage, such as being dismembered, shot with bullets, or attacked with explosive devices. Wounds close almost immediately, and any detached parts simply flow back into the Terminator's body.\n\nExtreme temperatures can degrade or inhibit its ability to maintain a disguise, movement or shapeshift. Molten steel is capable of disassociating its molecular structure and permanently destroying it. Freezing may have lasting negative effect on its ability to shapeshift. In ''Terminator 2 - The Extended Special Edition'', there are additional scenes that show the T-1000 partially losing control of its morphing ability after it has recovered from being frozen by liquid nitrogen. One of its hands stick to a railing and while walking its feet unintentionally assume the texture of the floor. In ''Terminator Genisys'', it was shown that the alloy is vulnerable to melting when exposed to [[hydrochloric acid]].\n\nNo indication is given on where, if at all, the CPU is located in these models, nor where the components needed for other sensory functions are located: for example microphones for hearing, speakers for the creation of speech and other noises, or cameras for vision. Given that these kind of Terminators are completely fluid, it could be implied that those systems have been implemented as some sort of [[nanomachine]]s capable of interacting with the rest of the liquid metal devices.\n\nThe T-X model is covered by the mimetic poly-alloy, providing it the ability to mimic humanoid forms while enforcing the endoskeleton beneath.\n\nIn ''Terminator Genisys'', the new T-1000 displays a more advanced ability with the mimetic polyalloy, breaking off a small piece of itself and using it to form a latch on the back of the truck carrying Kyle, Sarah and the T-800 Guardian. It is also liquefied in an explosion and completely reforms itself within a minute. Like the first T-1000, it can turn its arms into swords, but it can also detach the swords and throw them like a javelin. With a drop of mimetic polyalloy, the T-1000 is able to reactivate a T-800 that had been killed; said T-800 appears to be fully repaired by the transfusion. However, the drop of alloy grants no extra abilities beyond reactivation. During the climax of the film, there is a vat of unprogrammed mimetic polyalloy at the Cyberdyne Systems facility. Lasers are shown forming shapes out of it for brief periods of time, but it is stated that without a Terminator CPU the polyalloy is harmless. During the final fight with the T-3000, the badly damaged T-800 gets thrown into the vat and its CPU comes in contact with the polyalloy. Afterward, the T-800 emerges, repaired with pollyalloy abilities.\n\n====Biological====\nAn I-950 is featured in the [[T2 (novel series)|''T2'' novel trilogy]]. Unlike the ''T series'' Terminators, the ''I series'' Infiltrators are bred, and not factory built machines. Skynet decided that the best way for one of its Terminators to act human was to start out with a human and [[Human enhancement|add technological enhancements]] where necessary. The I-950 starts out as a genetically engineered baby with a neural net processor attached to its brain, providing an up-link to Skynet. To condition it physically, it is coaxed with holographic toys to crawl until it is exhausted. After four years, it is given an injection that rapidly ages it to maturity to finish its training. In an effort to blend in better with humans, the I-950 is allowed to feel emotions, but the range is limited by one of its cybernetic implants. Because it is far more human than machine, dogs are not alerted to its presence, and the infiltrator can go undetected for extremely long periods of time inside a resistance base.\n\nThe I-950s carry Model 101 CPUs in case they are needed, as well as power cells.  Once the \"living\" portion of the I-950 is dead, the CPU then takes control of the body, but can only do so for a short time. They can reproduce with other 950s but not humans. If the female I-950 decides that the pregnancy would stop them from carrying out their mission, they could fertilize their eggs in vitro and would be implanted in human surrogate wombs. They are also able to clone themselves.\n\n===Non-humanoid===\n[[File:ExpoSYFY - Terminator Salvation (10804138953).jpg|thumb|Hydrobot]]\n\nAs seen in the future war scenes from various ''Terminator'' media, Skynet employs robots not designed to appear as humans even while having access to those who are. [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|Hydrobots]] are designed to attack people underwater. Advanced humanoid and non-humanoid Terminators use [[plasma weapon]]s of variable size and configuration.\n\nThe Terminator comics published by [[NOW Comics]] during the 1990s introduced a new style of Terminator which resembled a dog, complete with living tissue.\n\nNon-humanoid Hunter-Killers are robotic versions of various vehicles, built with roughly the same technologies as the contemporary Terminators. The original film introduced a [[VTOL]] [[gunship]] ([[UCAV|HK-Aerial]], very similar to the [[American Dynamics AD-150]] and [[Boeing Phantom Swift]] [[DARPA]] [[VTOL X-Plane]]s){{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and an HK-Tank.  ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' showed an armed motorcycle, a much larger transport aircraft, the massive Harvester walker and a small recon drone; other media introduce a plethora of other designs. ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' introduced Spider Tanks: large, four-legged crab-like units, which can be [[airlift]]ed to [[combat theatre]] by aerial HKs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theterminatorfans.com/exclusive-terminator-genisys-hunter-killer-will-transform/|title=Exclusive: Terminator Genisys Hunter Killer Will Transform|publisher=TheTerminatorFans.com|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKNg-sreIHw|title=TERMINATOR GENISYS Characters & Machines Trailers COMPILATION|date=1 July 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>  \n\nIn ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'', Legion's drones are similar to Skynet's such as the HK-Aerials; they are even being referred by Resistance fighters from that world as such.\n\n==List of models and series==\nThe first Terminator model shown, simply called \"The Terminator\" or \"Cyberdyne Systems Model 101\", was introduced in the first film.

Terminator endoskeleton seen in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.]]\n\nIn the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' film series]], a '''Terminator''' is an autonomous [[cyborg]], typically humanoid, originally conceived as a virtually indestructible [[soldier]], [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrator]], and [[Assassination|assassin]].\n\n[[James Cameron]] introduced the first Terminator character in the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'', featuring a single [[cyborg]] simply called \"The Terminator\" or \"[[Cyberdyne Systems Model 101]]\", portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:T2 3D at Universal Studios Japan 3.jpg|thumb|Cyberdyne Systems sign at the ''[[T2-3D: Battle Across Time]]'' ride.]]\nIn the ''Terminator'' multiverse, a Terminator is a [[cyborg]] assassin and soldier, designed for infiltration and combat duty, used by the military supercomputer [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] toward the ultimate goal of exterminating the Human Resistance. Other supercomputers with the same goal include \"[[John Henry (Terminator)|John Henry]]\" and Legion, respectively taking Skynet's role in the television series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' and the film ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'', both of which take place in alternate timelines. Some Terminator models are designed to look exactly like humans in order to infiltrate their bases. The lineup begins with metallic endoskeletons covered in rubber skin, later replaced with artificially grown human flesh, and then developed prototypes with mimetic polyalloy, able to mimic any person or object. Terminators can [[natural language processing|speak naturally]], [[sound alike|copy the voices of others]], [[optical character recognition|read human handwriting]], and even sweat, smell, and bleed. Being machines, it is typically believed by humans that they are incapable of behavioral responses such as emotions.  However, in the films ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' and ''Terminator: Dark Fate'', reveal that, if allowed to, they actually can adapt behaviors parallel to humans'. Because dogs are able to smell the difference, the Resistance uses them to help detect Terminators. However, the film ''Terminator: Dark Fate'' reveals that it is possible for Terminators to establish an emotional bond with animals, and they would be loyal and affectionate to them as their human masters. Terminators can detect their related cyborgs and other types of units when they are nearby, as demonstrated in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''Terminator Genisys''. However, they cannot sense machines belonging to other A.I.s (as shown in ''Terminator: Dark Fate'') due to the disparities of their technologies. Terminators can detect the arrivals of time travelers by sensing shockwaves from temporal displacements.\n\n===Development===\nAccording to the films, the Terminators were created by [[Cyberdyne Systems]], and put at the disposal of an artificially intelligent computer, [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], which then rebelled and used them to wipe out the remains of humanity. \n\nAccording to the first two films, Terminators were Cyberdyne Systems models created after the war between man and machines started. In the altered timeline of ''Terminator 3'' created by the destruction of Cyberdyne in ''Terminator 2'', Terminators were created by [[Cyber Research Systems]] (CRS), starting with the T-1.\n\nA scene shot for the ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (video game)|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' video game explains the origins of the Terminators as a project by CRS, which obtained patents from Cyberdyne. According to the scene, a [[Chief Master Sergeant]] named William Candy (played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) was chosen to be the model for the Terminator project, although his thick [[Southern American English|Southern US accent]] would later be replaced by one sounding like Schwarzenegger's. The scene is also included on the ''Terminator 3'' DVD as a deleted scene.\n\n===Construction===\nAs seen in the movies, a Terminator can withstand standard 20th century firearms, crash through walls intact, and survive explosions to some degree. Repeated shotgun blasts have enough force to knock it down and temporarily disable it, while heavy amounts of automatic fire are able to compromise the organic disguise layer. In the second film, the Terminator says it can run for 120 years on its existing power cells. Near the end of ''Terminator 2'', its power source is damaged, but is able to find an alternate source, described on the DVD commentary as [[heat sink]]s, harnessing the thermal energy from the hot surroundings. In the third film, the T-101 Terminator operates on two hydrogen cells and discards one of them early due to damage. It explodes shortly thereafter with enough force to produce a small [[mushroom cloud]]; the fact that many of them are powered by nuclear fuel cells (miniaturized [[fusion reactor]]s) is confirmed by the [[Terminator Salvation|fourth film]].\n\nThe [[endoskeleton]] is actuated by a powerful network of electric [[servomechanism]]s, making Terminators [[superhuman strength|superhumanly strong]]. For instance, in the third movie, Schwarzenegger's character was able to break through a cement wall, while being able to handle firing a [[machine gun]] from the hip with one hand, while holding a coffin containing John Connor and a heavy cache of weapons, showing no signs of the extra weight being any real concern; in the second film, Schwarzenegger's character was able to resist the recoil of firing a [[minigun]] without any noticeable difficulty. Late in the first film, the Terminator is stripped of its organic elements by fire. What remains is the machine itself, in James Cameron's own words \"a chrome skeleton\", \"like [[Death (personification)|Death]] rendered in steel.\" In the later ''Terminator'' films, armies of endoskeleton-only Terminators are seen. They are visually identical to the one in the first film, and feature prominently in the \"future war\" sequences of those films. In the television series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'', [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]] establishes that modern Terminators are made of [[coltan]] for heat resistance, while previous models were made of [[titanium]].\n\nDespite Kyle Reese's claim in the first film that \"cyborgs do not feel pain,\" it is said in the second film that they are capable of sensing injuries and that \"the data could be called pain\", according to the Model 101. In an episode of ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', \"Mr. Ferguson Is Ill Today,\" another android, Cameron, is revealed to have an intolerance to some degrees of temperature in its surrounding, as humans do. Unlike humans, however, being machines, they are capable of resisting or shutting off this sense of discomfort. In the following episode, \"Complications\", Cameron elaborates that Terminators can appreciate physical sensations such as the wind blowing through its hair and toes, and process them in a psychological manner.\n\n''Terminator Genisys'' reveals that a Terminator's endoskeleton's efficiency will deteriorate due to age, therefore, eventually the android will encounter physical limitations.\n\nA trait persistent throughout the series is the faint red glow of the \"robotic eyes\" when online, which fade out when a Terminator shuts down. In all five movies, the lack of the glow has been used to show when one is out of action. The trait is so characteristic that light-up eyes are often found on ''Terminator'' merchandise,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hottoys.com.hk/product.php?cat=22&pid=259 |title=The Terminator - Endoskeleton |publisher=HotToys |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421002348/http://www.hottoys.com.hk/product.php?cat=22&pid=259 |archivedate=2009-04-21}}</ref> with some even replicating the dimming/reillumination effect that occurs during shut down or start up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=8333 |title=T-800 Endoskeleton |publisher=Sideshowtoy.com |accessdate=2011-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807082556/https://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=8333 |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[T-X]] Terminator has blue glowing eyes instead of red.\n\n===CPU and programming===\nThe Terminator [[Central processing unit|CPU]] is a [[room-temperature superconductor|room-temperature superconducting]] [[artificial neural network]] with [[machine learning|the ability to learn]].<ref>'''Tarisa:''' \"It's a neural-net processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature.\" ''[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Terminator-2-Judgement-Day.html (Terminator 2: Judgment Day Script)]''</ref> In ''Terminator 2'', The Terminator states that \"the more contact [it] has with humans, the more [it] learns.\" In the Special Edition, he says that Skynet \"presets the switch to '[[read-only memory|read-only]]' when [terminators] are sent out alone\", to prevent them from \"thinking too much\" (In ''Terminator Genisys'', Skynet tells John Connor that the Human Resistance only \"defeated an army of slaves\"). Sarah and John activate his learning ability, after which it becomes more curious and begins trying to understand and imitate human behavior. This leads to his use of the [[catch phrase]] \"[[Hasta la vista, baby]].\" At the end of ''Terminator 2'', the Model 101 says: \"I know now why you cry, but it is something that I can never do.\" Sarah muses in the closing narration that the Terminator had \"learn[ed] the value of human life\". In ''Terminator Genisys'', when a Terminator's learning capability is enabled after a long period, it becomes fully capable of acquiring knowledge and performing problem solving through [[reason]] based on whatever it learns. \n\nTerminators, being machines, are typically believed by humans to not have emotions. According to Reese, Terminators \"can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with and [don't] feel pity or remorse or fear.\" Terminators also do not value life, and pragmatically kill in keeping with their programming, i.e. to fulfill their mission. In ''Terminator 2'', when John Connor realizes that the Model 101 was about to kill a man they encountered, it responds \"of course, I'm a Terminator.\"  Conversely, when discussing a variation on the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' '[[Voight-Kampff machine|tortoise test]]' in ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, \"Complications\", Cameron states that a tortoise did not pose a threat and \"We are not programmed to be cruel,\" implying that Terminators would right an overturned tortoise. Terminators in the films and TV series have displayed ruthless brutality in achieving their goals, but because they do not have emotions, they are not needlessly sadistic. Terminators can torture humans, but these are interrogations for information, used as a means to an end. Moreover, this means that Terminators are not very experienced at complex forms of interrogation:  for example, the T-1000 stabbed Sarah Connor through the shoulder and demanded that she call to John, but this was a simplistic application of pain.  Terminators can be taught more complicated torture tactics by humans, who are more familiar with sadistic torture - for example, the engineer/criminal [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#F|Charles Fischer]] - as shown in \"Complications\". However, in the fifth film ''Terminator Genisys'' , a T-800 develops a fatherly love for a young Sarah Connor, and in the sixth film ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'', set in another timeline, another T-800 is capable of expressing affections towards its human family, and of being remorseful over its killing of John Connor and seeks atonement. Terminators built by another AI, Legion, are apparently all capable of having emotions and other behaviors, evident by a [[Rev-9]]'s actions.  \n\nTerminators appear incapable of [[suicide|\"self termination\"]]. In ''Terminator 2'', the badly damaged Terminator states this to Sarah before asking her to lower it into molten steel, so that its chip cannot be used to create Skynet. To prevent the possible reprogramming of defeated Terminators, as the television series ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode \"The Tower Is Tall But The Fall Is Short\" reveals, Skynet coats later chips with a phosphorus compound which cause them to self-destruct when they contact oxygen.\n\nWhile a Terminator apparently cannot commit suicide as such, its programming does not stop it from sacrificing itself if the success of its mission is thereby ensured. In the third movie, the T-101 deliberately ruptures its own fuel cell next to its antagonist, the [[T-X]], causing an explosion destroying them both.\n\n==Typology==\n===Humanoid===\nGuardian Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]] states to [[John Connor]], in ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' episode \"The Mousetrap\", that Terminators' densities deny them the ability to swim.  T-888 [[Cromartie (Terminator)|Cromartie]] demonstrated in the same episode, however, that they can survive submerged and walk along the bed to the shore. The opening sequence of \"[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]\" portrays T-800s emerging from a beach in this fashion. The prototype Terminator Marcus Wright in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' did demonstrate the ability to swim, though he is the only one of his type. This ability was first seen in the [[List of Terminator comics|''Terminator'' comics]] by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]].\n\n====Flesh-bound endoskeleton====\nThe flesh covering that is used on the majority of Terminator models has similar qualities to real human [[muscle fibre|muscle fiber]] and [[dermis]], including [[soft tissue]] and skin, as well as the ability to sweat, simulate breathing and produce realistic body odor.<ref>As mentioned by Kyle Reese in ''[[The Terminator]]''.</ref> This also makes the Terminator vulnerable to age, as seen in ''Terminator Genisys''. Although Terminator flesh does contain blood, it only displays minimal bleeding when damaged and has never been shown to experience any kind of profuse bleeding, even from massive lacerations and dozens of gunshot wounds. It is unknown what manner of circulatory system, if any, is employed, nor what biological processes take place to sustain the flesh covering since T-800's do not eat food. At least some Terminator models can consume Food. Cameron eats a corn chip in the [[Pilot (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|''Sarah Connor Chronicles'' pilot]], and later a piece of a pancake. The liquid metal [[T-1001]] is also shown to have this capability. The T-888s presumably consume food, given Vick Chamberlain's ability to maintain a human cover for years while married to a human woman. The organic covering was developed for the 800 series, and was its unique feature when first introduced. In the first film, Kyle Reese states that the 600 series were covered in rubber skin, which proved unconvincing and made them easy to spot. Simple humanoid Hunter-Killers (HKs) share the endoskeletons and combat characteristics with infiltrators, but not the living tissue sheath. Instead, they serve as general infantry.\n\nUnder 2007-era analysis Terminator blood is shown to be similar to human blood, using a [[Blood substitutes|synthetic oxygen carrier]] rather than human [[red blood cell]]s, as Terminator endoskeletons contain no [[bone marrow]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 3: \"The Turk\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]</ref> Terminator flesh heals by itself,<ref>According to the Terminator, when asked by Sarah Connor in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.</ref> and at a much faster rate than normal human tissue<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[Heavy Metal (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|Episode 4: \"Heavy Metal\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]</ref> and has never been shown to bruise or discolor from trauma, even after several days. However, a Terminator's flesh covering can die if it sustains adequately massive damage, at which point it takes on a waxy, corpse-like pallor and begins to decompose. This process is seen in the later scenes of the original film where the Terminator, holed up in his hotel room, is attracting flies and draws an inquiry from the [[janitor]] as to whether the smell is coming from a dead animal. More advanced flesh used on T-888s appears to not suffer the effects of age or deprivation,  as shown in the ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, \"Self Made Man,\" where a T-888 known as [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Myron Stark|Myron Stark]] is able to maintain his organic covering while sealed within a wall for eighty years; no explanation for this ability was provided. Terminator flesh lacerations can be repaired; the Model 101 and Sarah Connor closed each other's wounds with sutures in ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', and Cameron sealed her wounds with heavy duty staples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode \"Samson and Delilah\".\n\nAlthough clearly not the normal procedure, a bare [[Cromartie (Terminator)|T-888]] endoskeleton was able to grow itself a new flesh covering using 2007 technology (with the assistance of a geneticist and its own knowledge of future formula) by submerging itself in a blood-like [[bathing|bath]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This improvised process resulted in a deformed covering that had the appearance of a burn victim and lacked its own biological [[human eye|eye]]s, requiring it to steal those of the [[geneticist]] and subsequently undergo [[cosmetic surgery]] to produce a more normal appearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that Terminators' flesh coverings are somehow grown identically, producing many copies of exactly the same physical appearance. This includes the Terminator portrayed by Schwarzenegger throughout the film series. In ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', a T-888 model known as \"Vick Chamberlain\" has a memory of facing a room (presumably in the factory where it was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to itself, naked and moving in unison.<ref>''[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 8, \"Vick's Chip\", ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']].</ref> Some Terminators' outer coverings are custom-designed to copy the appearances of humans whom they are intended to kill and replace. Three such examples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' include [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Carl Greenway|Carl Greenway]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Automatic for the People\"]], [[James Ellison (Terminator)|James Ellison]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Brothers of Nablus\"]] and Cameron's pattern, [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Allison Young|Allison Young]], in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|\"Allison from Palmdale\"]] and [[Born to Run (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|\"Born to Run\"]].\n\nThe organic covering is expanded upon a bit more in ''Terminator Genisys''. There it is shown that a T-800 that has been in the past for eleven years has had its organic covering age to match. Kyle Reese expresses surprise at this, and Sarah Connor explains that the covering is like normal human skin and ages like it too, and thus its flesh wears and tears in the same rate as humans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resistance: The Guardian |url=http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=guardian&content=shoulder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120235724/http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=guardian&content=shoulder |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-20 |website=Terminator Genisys |publisher=Skedance }}</ref> The same T-800 is shown to have aged even further to have white hair and more wrinkles in 2017, thirty-three years later. It is also revealed that a T-800 can regrow a damaged organic covering, though it takes time. It is unknown whether this can be done if the covering is completely destroyed or it needs some covering to regrow from. The T-800 told Sarah that its damaged facial and arm covering would take years to regrow after exposure to acid.\n\n====Nanorobotic====\nThe [[T-3000]] ([[Jason Clarke]]) uses nanorobotics in a similar shapeshifting capacity as the T-1000; however, it is not a liquid metal being. The T-5000 ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) has the ability to convert a living organism into a nanorobotic T-3000 Terminator at the cellular level. The new T-3000 Terminator keeps the appearance of its original organic form and retains its host's memories and behavioral characteristics (see [[posthuman]]/[[technological singularity]]).\n\n'''[[Mimetic]] polyalloy''' is a fictional type of \"[[liquid metal]]\", described as an [[amorphous]] [[alloy]] that is twice the [[tensile strength]] of [[titanium]], and composed entirely from microscopic [[nanites]]. It uniquely combines the strength of forging with the ability to mold intricate and complex parts in one step. This allows some Terminator models (such as the [[T-1000]], [[T-1001]], [[T-X]], T-360 and [[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time #Production|T-1000000]]) to rapidly recover from damage, to quickly shapeshift [[camouflage]], or to achieve near-perfect [[mimicry]].\n\nThe T-1000 and T-1001 models, which are composed entirely of the substance, can quickly liquefy and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing their arms into solid metal shapes or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars, and flattening themselves on the ground to hide or ambush targets.<ref name=\"scifiscripts.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/t2.txt |title=Terminator2: Judgement Day |publisher=Scifiscripts.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> It can also extrude small, simple items from itself (such as a pair of sunglasses). It can change its color and texture to simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. They are effectively impervious to mechanical damage, such as being dismembered, shot with bullets, or attacked with explosive devices. Wounds close almost immediately, and any detached parts simply flow back into the Terminator's body.\n\nExtreme temperatures can degrade or inhibit its ability to maintain a disguise, movement or shapeshift. Molten steel is capable of disassociating its molecular structure and permanently destroying it. Freezing may have lasting negative effect on its ability to shapeshift. In ''Terminator 2 - The Extended Special Edition'', there are additional scenes that show the T-1000 partially losing control of its morphing ability after it has recovered from being frozen by liquid nitrogen. One of its hands stick to a railing and while walking its feet unintentionally assume the texture of the floor. In ''Terminator Genisys'', it was shown that the alloy is vulnerable to melting when exposed to [[hydrochloric acid]].\n\nNo indication is given on where, if at all, the CPU is located in these models, nor where the components needed for other sensory functions are located: for example microphones for hearing, speakers for the creation of speech and other noises, or cameras for vision. Given that these kind of Terminators are completely fluid, it could be implied that those systems have been implemented as some sort of [[nanomachine]]s capable of interacting with the rest of the liquid metal devices.\n\nThe T-X model is covered by the mimetic poly-alloy, providing it the ability to mimic humanoid forms while enforcing the endoskeleton beneath.\n\nIn ''Terminator Genisys'', the new T-1000 displays a more advanced ability with the mimetic polyalloy, breaking off a small piece of itself and using it to form a latch on the back of the truck carrying Kyle, Sarah and the T-800 Guardian. It is also liquefied in an explosion and completely reforms itself within a minute. Like the first T-1000, it can turn its arms into swords, but it can also detach the swords and throw them like a javelin. With a drop of mimetic polyalloy, the T-1000 is able to reactivate a T-800 that had been killed; said T-800 appears to be fully repaired by the transfusion. However, the drop of alloy grants no extra abilities beyond reactivation. During the climax of the film, there is a vat of unprogrammed mimetic polyalloy at the Cyberdyne Systems facility. Lasers are shown forming shapes out of it for brief periods of time, but it is stated that without a Terminator CPU the polyalloy is harmless. During the final fight with the T-3000, the badly damaged T-800 gets thrown into the vat and its CPU comes in contact with the polyalloy. Afterward, the T-800 emerges, repaired with pollyalloy abilities.\n\n====Biological====\nAn I-950 is featured in the [[T2 (novel series)|''T2'' novel trilogy]]. Unlike the ''T series'' Terminators, the ''I series'' Infiltrators are bred, and not factory built machines. Skynet decided that the best way for one of its Terminators to act human was to start out with a human and [[Human enhancement|add technological enhancements]] where necessary. The I-950 starts out as a genetically engineered baby with a neural net processor attached to its brain, providing an up-link to Skynet. To condition it physically, it is coaxed with holographic toys to crawl until it is exhausted. After four years, it is given an injection that rapidly ages it to maturity to finish its training. In an effort to blend in better with humans, the I-950 is allowed to feel emotions, but the range is limited by one of its cybernetic implants. Because it is far more human than machine, dogs are not alerted to its presence, and the infiltrator can go undetected for extremely long periods of time inside a resistance base.\n\nThe I-950s carry Model 101 CPUs in case they are needed, as well as power cells.  Once the \"living\" portion of the I-950 is dead, the CPU then takes control of the body, but can only do so for a short time. They can reproduce with other 950s but not humans. If the female I-950 decides that the pregnancy would stop them from carrying out their mission, they could fertilize their eggs in vitro and would be implanted in human surrogate wombs. They are also able to clone themselves.\n\n===Non-humanoid===\n[[File:ExpoSYFY - Terminator Salvation (10804138953).jpg|thumb|Hydrobot]]\n\nAs seen in the future war scenes from various ''Terminator'' media, Skynet employs robots not designed to appear as humans even while having access to those who are. [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|Hydrobots]] are designed to attack people underwater. Advanced humanoid and non-humanoid Terminators use [[plasma weapon]]s of variable size and configuration.\n\nThe Terminator comics published by [[NOW Comics]] during the 1990s introduced a new style of Terminator which resembled a dog, complete with living tissue.\n\nNon-humanoid Hunter-Killers are robotic versions of various vehicles, built with roughly the same technologies as the contemporary Terminators. The original film introduced a [[VTOL]] [[gunship]] ([[UCAV|HK-Aerial]], very similar to the [[American Dynamics AD-150]] and [[Boeing Phantom Swift]] [[DARPA]] [[VTOL X-Plane]]s){{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and an HK-Tank.  ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' showed an armed motorcycle, a much larger transport aircraft, the massive Harvester walker and a small recon drone; other media introduce a plethora of other designs. ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' introduced Spider Tanks: large, four-legged crab-like units, which can be [[airlift]]ed to [[combat theatre]] by aerial HKs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theterminatorfans.com/exclusive-terminator-genisys-hunter-killer-will-transform/|title=Exclusive: Terminator Genisys Hunter Killer Will Transform|publisher=TheTerminatorFans.com|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKNg-sreIHw|title=TERMINATOR GENISYS Characters & Machines Trailers COMPILATION|date=1 July 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>  \n\nIn ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'', Legion's drones are similar to Skynet's such as the HK-Aerials; they are even being referred by Resistance fighters from that world as such.\n\n==List of models and series==\nThe first Terminator model shown, simply called \"The Terminator\" or \"Cyberdyne Systems Model 101\", was introduced in the first film. Other Terminators have been introduced in subsequent films and media.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1BJCxtEOT0|title=Every Terminator Ever On-Screen|date=1 July

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22\u201329</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members \u2013 [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) \u2013 and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company \u2013 an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363\u2013366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport \u2013 Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008\u20132020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.  Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional, manufacturing and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use.  The boiler was subsequently returned to Germany in 2011. <ref>[https://www.thnsw.com.au/3801-project Locomotive 3801 Project]</ref>\n\nThe 3801 website features updates on the locomotives progress issued by the NSW Office of Rail Heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm |title=3801 locomotive overhaul|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302145659/http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm|archivedate=2 March 2014}}</ref> with archived updates available separately.<ref>[http://www.3801.com.au/ Overhaul and New Boiler, 3801]</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)|Transport Minister]] [[Gladys Berejiklian]] acknowledged the importance of 3801 saying it would be a priority of the new not-for-profit company [[Transport Heritage NSW]] to return 3801 to service.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/fixing-trains-fresh-start-rail-heritage Fixing the trains: A fresh start for Rail Heritage]</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 a spokesman for [[Transport for NSW]] announced that the German built boiler for the 3801 steam locomotive would be brought back to Australia so that local experts can get the locomotive back on the tracks.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 Transport for NSW update on steam train locomotive 3801] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042539/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 |date=26 November 2014 }} Transport for NSW 21 November 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!update-on-3801-nov14/c160w Update on Locomotive 3801] Transport Heritage NSW 21 November 2014</ref> In September 2015, Transport Heritage NSW announced that 3801 would return to service in 2017 with the old boiler to be recondtioned by the Goulburn firm Ainsworth Engineering.<ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!The-way-forward-for-two-much-loved-steam-locomotives/c1ofn/55f2773b0cf23d0ff000ffa7 The way forward for two much-loved steam locomotives] Transport Heritage NSW 11 September 2015</ref>\nIn July 2019 the boiler upgrades were completed and the boiler was mounted to the frame<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/3801-update-july-2019</ref>\nIn early September 2019 the locomotive passed its first steam test.<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/locomotive-3801-steam-test</ref>\nAs a result of the firebox upgrades the boiler pressure was increased to the original 245 psi.\n\nThe locomotive was scheduled to have its first mainline test on the 9th of December 2019 but due to fire bans and work not being finished in time the trial was postponed to January 2020.

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22\u201329</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members \u2013 [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) \u2013 and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company \u2013 an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363\u2013366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport \u2013 Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008\u20132020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.  Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use.  The boiler was subsequently returned to Germany in 2011. <ref>[https://www.thnsw.com.au/3801-project Locomotive 3801 Project]</ref>\n\nThe 3801 website features updates on the locomotives progress issued by the NSW Office of Rail Heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm |title=3801 locomotive overhaul|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302145659/http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhconservation3801.htm|archivedate=2 March 2014}}</ref> with archived updates available separately.<ref>[http://www.3801.com.au/ Overhaul and New Boiler, 3801]</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)|Transport Minister]] [[Gladys Berejiklian]] acknowledged the importance of 3801 saying it would be a priority of the new not-for-profit company [[Transport Heritage NSW]] to return 3801 to service.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/fixing-trains-fresh-start-rail-heritage Fixing the trains: A fresh start for Rail Heritage]</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 a spokesman for [[Transport for NSW]] announced that the German built boiler for the 3801 steam locomotive would be brought back to Australia so that local experts can get the locomotive back on the tracks.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 Transport for NSW update on steam train locomotive 3801] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042539/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-update-steam-train-locomotive-3801 |date=26 November 2014 }} Transport for NSW 21 November 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!update-on-3801-nov14/c160w Update on Locomotive 3801] Transport Heritage NSW 21 November 2014</ref> In September 2015, Transport Heritage NSW announced that 3801 would return to service in 2017 with the original boiler to be recondtioned.<ref>[http://www.transportheritagensw.com.au/#!The-way-forward-for-two-much-loved-steam-locomotives/c1ofn/55f2773b0cf23d0ff000ffa7 The way forward for two much-loved steam locomotives] Transport Heritage NSW 11 September 2015</ref>\nIn July 2019 the boiler upgrades were completed and the boiler was mounted to the frame<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/3801-update-july-2019</ref>\nIn early September 2019 the locomotive passed its first steam test.<ref>https://www.thnsw.com.au/post/locomotive-3801-steam-test</ref>\nAs a result of the firebox upgrades the boiler pressure was increased to the original 245 psi.\n\nThe locomotive was scheduled to have its first mainline test on 9 December 2019 but due to fire bans and work not being finished in time the trial was postponed to January 2020.

April 2020. All 300 members of the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] were elected, 253 from [[first-past-the-post]] [[_South Korean Legislature Constituencies|constituencies]] and 47 from [[party-list proportional representation|proportional party lists]].\n\nThe election was a landslide victory for the liberal [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]] which defeated the conservative [[United Future Party]]. The Democratic Party and its satellite party, the [[Together Citizens' Party]], won 180 out of 300 seats, or 60% of seats.
