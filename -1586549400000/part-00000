He moved to acting in Hindi films and got introduced to the industry with 1955's ''[[Railway Platform (film)|Railway Platform]]''.\n\nHe shot to stardom in the 1957 film ''[[Mother India]]'' in which he co-starred with [[Nargis]] as her short-tempered, angry son. During the making of this film a fire happened on the set. It is believed that Dutt braved the raging fire to save Nargis and thereby won her love. They went on to marry in 1958. They had one son [[Sanjay Dutt]], also a successful film actor and two daughters, [[Priya Dutt]] and Namrata Dutt. His daughter Namrata married [[Kumar Gaurav]], son of [[Rajendra Kumar]]. The two fathers were co-stars in ''Mother India''.\n\nDutt was one of the major stars of [[Hindi cinema]] in the late 1950s and 1960s and continued to star in many successful films which included ''[[Sadhna]]'' (1958), ''[[Sujata (1959 film)|Sujata]]'' (1959), ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963), ''[[Khandan (1965 film)|Khandan]]'' (1965) and ''[[Padosan]]'' (1967). His collaboration with [[B.R. Chopra]] proved to be successful in films such as ''[[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumraah]]'' (1963), ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965) and ''[[Hamraaz]]'' (1967). One of his favourite writers and friends was [[Aghajani Kashmeri]]. Dutt created a record of sorts by directing and starring in the unique film ''[[Yaadein (1964 film)|Yaadein]]'' (1964) in which he was the only actor in the cast. He later turned producer of the 1968 film ''Man Ka Meet'' which introduced his brother Som Dutt who was unsuccessful in films. In 1971, he produced, directed and starred in ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971) which was a huge failure at the box office. He continued to star in hits that included ''[[Heera (1973 film)|Heera]]'' (1973), ''[[Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye]]'' (1974), ''[[Nagin (1976 film)|Nagin]]'' (1976), ''[[Jaani Dushman]]''  (1979), ''[[Muqabla (1979 film)|Muqabla]]'' (1979), and ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980).

He moved to acting in Hindi films and got introduced to the industry with 1955's ''[[Railway Platform (film)|Railway Platform]]''.\n\nHe shot to stardom in the 1957 film ''[[Mother India]]'' in which he co-starred with [[Nargis]] as her short-tempered, angry son. During the making of this film a fire happened on the set. It is believed that Dutt braved the raging fire to save Nargis and thereby won her love. They went on to marry in 1958. They had one son [[Sanjay Dutt]], also a successful film actor and two daughters, [[Priya Dutt]] and Namrata Dutt. His daughter Namrata married [[Kumar Gaurav]], son of [[Rajendra Kumar]]. The two fathers were co-stars in ''Mother India''.\n\nDutt was one of the major stars of [[Hindi cinema]] in the late 1950s and 1960s and continued to star in many successful films which included ''[[Sadhna]]'' (1958), ''[[Sujata (1959 film)|Sujata]]'' (1959), ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963), ''[[Khandan (1965 film)|Khandan]]'' (1965) and ''[[Padosan]]'' (1967). His collaboration with [[B.R. Chopra]] proved to be successful in films such as ''[[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumraah]]'' (1963), ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965) and ''[[Hamraaz]]'' (1967). One of his favourite writers and friends was [[Aghajani Kashmeri]]. Dutt created a record of sorts by directing and starring in the unique film ''[[Yaadein (1964 film)|Yaadein]]'' (1964) in which he was the only actor in the cast. He later turned producer of the 1968 film ''Man Ka Meet'' which introduced his brother Som Dutt who was unsuccessful in films. In 1971, he produced, directed and starred in ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971) which was a huge failure at the box office. He continued to star in hits that included ''[[Heera (1973 film)|Heera]]'' (1973), ''[[Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye]]'' (1974), ''[[Nagin (1976 film)|Nagin]]'' (1976), ''[[Jaani Dushman]]''  (1979), ''[[Muqabla (1979 film)|Muqabla]]'' (1979), and ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980). He also starred in a series of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] religious movies in the 1970s: ''[[Man Jeete Jag Jeet]]'' (1973), ''[[Dukh Bhanjan Tera Naam]]'' (1974), and ''[[Sat Sri Akal]]'' (1977).<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.afternoondc.in/adc-initiative/latest/article_4702\n| title = A towering personality\n| website = www.afternoondc.in\n| access-date = 28 February 2016\n}}</ref> Even in 1980s he starred in a both leading and supporting role in several successful movies such as ''[[Dard Ka Rishta]]'' (1982), ''[[Badle Ki Aag]]'' (1982), ''[[Raaj Tilak]]'' (1984), ''Mangal Dada'' (1986), ''[[Watan Ke Rakhwale]]'' (1987) and ''[[Dharamyudh (film)|Dharamyudh]]''(1988).\n\nHe launched his son Sanjay's career with ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' in 1981 which was a success.

{"title_page": "Oitbi", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\nThe '''Oitbi'''  were an [[indigenous Australian]] people of the [[Cobourg Peninsula]] of the [[Northern Territory]].\n\n==Language==\nA short word-list of Oitbi vocabulary was obtained by Paul Foelsche, and included in the compilation of Australian tribes composed by [[Edward Micklethwaite Curr]] in 1886-1887. Foelsche recorded this as the language of the people of [[Raffles Bay]],{{efn|Foelsche identified this tribe as the Unalla, specifying that their land extended from Raffles Bay to Port Essengton, then further up the Colbourg Peninsula as far as Popham Bay.{{sfn|Foelsche|1886}} }} but Tindale identified it as coming from a remnant of the Oitbi community.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}} It is one of the [[Iwaidjan languages]]. The name \"Oitbi\" might have been a mishearing of ''warrkbi'', the Iwaidja word for 'person'.\n\n==Country==\n[[Norman Tindale]] estimated that the Oitbi's traditional lands extended over some 300 sq.miles, from the southern coast of the Cobourg Peninsula to the [[Sir George Hope Islands]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974}}\n\n==People==\nThe explorer [[George Windsor Earl]] who wrote one of the earliest records of the Oitbi, comparing them favourably with the [[Jaako people|Jaako]], comes from the voyager [[George Windsor Earl]] remarked on what he perceived to be a Polynesian component in the makeup of the Oitbi:-\n\n<blockquote>Arched eyebrows, straight silky hair, and complexions fairer than those of the Australian aborigines generally, were by no means uncommon and many individuals possessed, in a considerable degree, that obliquity in the position of the eyes, which is considered as being characteristic of some of the Polynesian tribes. These appearances were even more developed in the people from the mountain ranges who occasionally visited us. Upon the whole, I am very much inclined to suppose that there has been some infusion of the Polynesian blood among the aborigines of this part of the continent.{{sfn|Earl|1846|p=244}}</blockquote>\n\n==History==\nThe Oitbi probably experienced considerable interaction with the [[Makassar people|Makassans]] during their [[Makassan contact with Australia|annual trading ventures around the waters of northern Australia]]. One indication of their presence among the Oitbi is one of their ethnonyms, ''Bidjenelumbo,'' which appears to be of [[Malay language|Malayan origin]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\nThey suffered, like many of the aboriginal people of this area, a rapid phase of tribal disaggregation with the onset of European colonization, perhaps due also to the pressure of tribes on their south eastern flank driving them into the peninsula.{{sfn|Earl|1846|p=242}} In addition, if Tindale was correct in interpreting the language obtained by Paul Foelsche, the Inspector of Police at Port Darwin, from the 'Unalla' as being that of the Oitbi, then Foelsche states that by 1881, their numbers were down to 30: 7 men, 12 women, 9 boys and 2 girls.{{sfn|Foelsche|1886|p=270}} The drastic reduction from a once numerous tribe was attributed to the effects of smallpox introduced by Makassar trepangers in 1866, which decimated the tribe.{{sfn|Foelsche|1886|p=271}} Many of the tribes appear to have melted into the [[Iwaidja]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\nIn addition to the Oitbi there were five other tribes who managed to maintain memories of their independent tribal identities in the early period of European settlement: [[Wurango]], [[Jaako people|Jaako]], [[Iwaidja]], [[Amarak]], [[Djalakuru]]. The [[Gaari people|Gaari]], a seventh tribe, became extinct.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=141}}\n\n==Alternative names==\n* ''Heutbi'' (''oitbi/auitbi'' is their word for 'no.')\n* ''Oitbo.''\n* ''Bidjenelumbo, Bijnalumbo.''{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\n==Some words==\n* ''looloot'' (tame dog)\n* ''lurkakie.''

One indication of their presence among the Oitbi is one of their ethnonyms, ''Bidjenelumbo,'' which appears to be of [[Malay language|Malayan origin]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\nThey suffered, like many of the aboriginal people of this area, a rapid phase of tribal disaggregation with the onset of European colonization, perhaps due also to the pressure of tribes on their south eastern flank driving them into the peninsula.{{sfn|Earl|1846|p=242}} In addition, if Tindale was correct in interpreting the language obtained by Paul Foelsche, the Inspector of Police at Port Darwin, from the 'Unalla' as being that of the Oitbi, then Foelsche states that by 1881, their numbers were down to 30: 7 men, 12 women, 9 boys and 2 girls.{{sfn|Foelsche|1886|p=270}} The drastic reduction from a once numerous tribe was attributed to the effects of smallpox introduced by Makassar trepangers in 1866, which decimated the tribe.{{sfn|Foelsche|1886|p=271}} Many of the tribes appear to have melted into the [[Iwaidja]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\nIn addition to the Oitbi there were five other tribes who managed to maintain memories of their independent tribal identities in the early period of European settlement: [[Wurango]], [[Jaako people|Jaako]], [[Iwaidja]], [[Amarak]], [[Djalakuru]]. The [[Gaari]], a seventh tribe, became extinct.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=141}}\n\n==Alternative names==\n* ''Heutbi'' (''oitbi/auitbi'' is their word for 'no.')\n* ''Oitbo.''\n* ''Bidjenelumbo, Bijnalumbo.''{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=238}}\n\n==Some words==\n* ''looloot'' (tame dog)\n* ''lurkakie.''

When he approached him, Kl\u00e9ber extended his hand for al-Halabi to kiss in return for some money. Instead, al-Halabi violently pulled the general toward him and stabbed him four times with a [[stiletto]]. He was 23 years old when he assassinated the commander of the French campaign on Egyptian soil. Kl\u00e9ber's chief engineer tried to defend him and was stabbed but not mortally wounded.\n\nAl-Halabi hid in a nearby park where he was found by French soldiers, who searched him and found his stiletto.

When he approached him, Kl\u00e9ber extended his hand for al-Halabi to kiss in return for some money.

Kl\u00e9ber's chief engineer tried to defend him and was stabbed but not mortally wounded.\n\nAl-Halabi hid in a nearby park where he was found by French soldiers, who searched him and found his stiletto.
