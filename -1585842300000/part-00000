An IDF spokesman said the goal is \"to abduct or kill civilians but will make do with a soldier, too.\" The Israeli newspaper ''[[Ma'ariv]]'' reported that, according to unnamed Israeli security sources, the tunnels were to be utilized in a mass casualty terror attack planned to take place on the Jewish high holy day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], 24 September 2014. The plan was described to reporter Ariel Kahane by the sources, and reportedly revealed to the Israeli security Cabinet by Prime Minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu]]. The alleged plot entailed a planned assault in which two hundred of heavily armed Hamas fighters would have emerged at night from more than a dozen tunnels and infiltrate Israeli territory, killing and/or abducting Israeli citizens.<ref name=\"Jewish Telegraphic Agency\"/>\n\nAn unnamed \"senior intelligence source\" told ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' on 28 July that of the nine cross-border tunnels detected, none stretched into a civilian community, and that in the five infiltrations to that time Hamas had targeted soldiers rather than civilians.<ref name=\"Times of Israel - 29-July\"/> On 31 July IDF [[Army Radio]] quoted an unnamed \"senior military official\" as saying \"all the tunnels were aimed at military targets and not at the Gaza-vicinity communities\".<ref name=galeiTzahal/>\n\nA column in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' cited [[Yigal Carmon]], head of the [[Middle East Media Research Institute]] who claimed that it was the tunnels, and not the [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers]] that was the immediate cause of war in the summer of 2014. According to Carmon's reading of the situation, the tunnels gave Hamas the ability to stake a mass-casualty attack on the scale of the [[2008 Mumbai attack|2008 Islamist terror attack]] on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai that killed 164 people. A 5 July Israeli airstrike damaged a tunnel near Kibbutz [[Kerem Shalom]], and a group of Hamas military inspectors were killed in an explosion at the tunnel on 6 July. According to Carmon, this may have persuaded Hamas that Israel was becoming aware of the scale of the capacity for militants to infiltrate Israel via tunnels, making a successful surprise mass-casualty attack less likely, and convincing the Hamas leadership to go to war immediately before more of the tunnels could be discovered and destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael B.|last=Mukasey|authorlink1=Michael Mukasey|title=Tunnels Matter More Than Rockets to Hamas|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/michael-mukasey-tunnels-matter-more-than-rockets-to-hamas-1405894408|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=20 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Dershowitz]] argued that the goal of the tunnels was to facilitate \"mass casualties and kidnappings\", citing the proximity of tunnel exits to civilian targets such as Israeli kindergartens as well as the 17 July \"attempted mass casualty attack\" that preceded Israel's ground incursion.

The alleged plot entailed a planned assault in which two hundred of heavily armed Hamas fighters would have emerged at night from more than a dozen tunnels and infiltrate Israeli territory, killing and/or abducting Israeli citizens.<ref name=\"Jewish Telegraphic Agency\"/>\n\nAn unnamed \"senior intelligence source\" told ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' on 28 July that of the nine cross-border tunnels detected, none stretched into a civilian community, and that in the five infiltrations to that time Hamas had targeted soldiers rather than civilians.<ref name=\"Times of Israel - 29-July\"/> On 31 July IDF [[Army Radio]] quoted an unnamed \"senior military official\" as saying \"all the tunnels were aimed at military targets and not at the Gaza-vicinity communities\".<ref name=galeiTzahal/>\n\nA column in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' cited [[Yigal Carmon]], head of the [[Middle East Media Research Institute]] who claimed that it was the tunnels, and not the [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers]] that was the immediate cause of war in the summer of 2014. According to Carmon's reading of the situation, the tunnels gave Hamas the ability to stake a mass-casualty attack on the scale of the [[2008 Mumbai attack|2008 Islamist terror attack]] on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai that killed 164 people. A 5 July Israeli airstrike damaged a tunnel near Kibbutz [[Kerem Shalom]], and a group of Hamas military inspectors were killed in an explosion at the tunnel on 6 July. According to Carmon, this may have persuaded Hamas that Israel was becoming aware of the scale of the capacity for militants to infiltrate Israel via tunnels, making a successful surprise mass-casualty attack less likely, and convincing the Hamas leadership to go to war immediately before more of the tunnels could be discovered and destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael B.|last=Mukasey|authorlink1=Michael Mukasey|title=Tunnels Matter More Than Rockets to Hamas|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/michael-mukasey-tunnels-matter-more-than-rockets-to-hamas-1405894408|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=20 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Dershowitz]] argued that the goal of the tunnels was to facilitate \"mass casualties and kidnappings\", citing the proximity of tunnel exits to civilian targets such as Israeli kindergartens as well as the 17 July \"attempted mass casualty attack\" that preceded Israel's ground incursion.

They did as per Drona's instructions. When they reached the lake, Drona was taking a bath; suddenly a crocodile appeared and attacked Drona. Nobody except Arjuna dared to enter the lake. Arjuna jumped into the lake and began to attack the mighty crocodile with his bare hands. Suddenly the crocodile disappeared. Drona told everyone that the crocodile was just an illusion and was created by himself to test all the princes and Ashwatthama. Drona also scolded the rest for not taking the initiative to save their teacher.

When Drona was about to leave the court, Arjuna politely stopped him and vowed to defeat Drupada. Next day, all the Kauravas, along with [[Karna]] and 1 Akshouni infantry, attacked Drupada.

The test is to lift, string, and fire [[Shiva Dhanush|Pinakin]] to pierce the eye of a golden fish only by looking at its reflection; [[Drupada]] had designed this test with Arjuna in mind.

When Karna asked about his real identity, Arjuna smiled and said that he is brahmin. Then Karna praised him by comparing him with Lord [[Vishnu]]. Arjuna threatened to kill Karna which made Karna flee from battlefield.\nWhen the brothers returned with Draupadi, Arjuna joked to his mother that he had brought [[alms]]. Dismissively, and without looking because she was preoccupied, Kunti asked him to share it with his brothers. Holding his mother's orders as a divine command, he requested his elder brother to accept Draupadi. Draupadi had to marry all five of the Pandavas. Her five sons, one from each of the Pandava brothers, are known as the [[Upapandavas]]. [[Srutakarma]] is the son of Arjuna.\n\nAt this point in the Mahabharata, the Pandavas revealed that they were alive. With both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira being [[crown prince]]s, tensions were high. Under Bhishma's advice, the kingdom is split, with the Kauravas getting [[Hastinapur]] and the Pandavas getting [[Khandavaprastha]]. Khandavaprastha, however, was an extremely underdeveloped land and had [[Fertility (soil)|infertile soil]], requiring extensive [[tillage|tilling]], so the Pandavas set to work rebuilding the land by burning thousand acre of forest. Their cousins [[Krishna]] and [[Balarama]] helped them.\n\n==Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna==\nThe friendship bond of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and Arjuna is the most celebrated bond in Hindu mythology followed by the bond of [[Rama|Lord Rama]] and [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]]. According to Mahabharata, Arjuna was the incarnation of Lord Nara who was the best friend of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] and along with Nara, Lord Vishnu defeated all the demons after the churning of Ocean Samudra Manthan. According to Lord Shiva, Nara and Lord Vishnu holds the whole universe and incarnates in every Yuga to end the evil and establish righteousness. The love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna is evident from Adi Parva where after the fight in Khandava forest instead of asking any weapon or power Lord Krishna asked Indra that his friendship with Arjuna will remain forever when the latter asked Lord Krishna to ask for a boon. Lord Krishna also described his love for Arjuna in Vana Parva by saying that whoever will hate Arjuna will hate Lord Krishna and whoever will follow Arjuna will follow Lord Krishna. He even said that nobody in the whole world is dearer to him than Arjuna and he can sacrifice anything including his sons, wives and citizens just for the sake of Arjuna. During his final conversation with his father Vasudeva he told him that he wants Arjuna to perform his last rights and also said that Lord Krishna is Arjuna and Arjuna is Lord Krishna. Such was the greatness of Arjuna that the supreme god Lord Krishna was ready to sacrifice anything for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03012.htm|title=Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Burning of Khandava Vana==\nThe story, this was the first time Arjuna meets [[Krishna]]. In any case, [[Khandavaprastha]] was where Arjuna and Krishna's friendship is truly forged. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met the god of fire, [[Agni]]. Agni was in great hunger and needed to burn down the entire Khandava Vana to quench his hunger. But [[Takshaka]], the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of [[Indra]]'s. So the latter brought down heavy rains to thwart Agni's plans to burn the woods. Agni requested Krishna and Arjuna to help him realise his goal.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\">{{cite book|title=Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa.|year=2008|publisher=The Echo Library|location=Teddington, Middlesex|isbn=9781406870459|pages=518\u2013520}}</ref>\n\nArjuna asked Agni for Gandiva as normal bows were not capable to bear the strength of his arms. The three of them then invoked [[Varuna]], the [[God]] of the [[oceans]]. Varuna blessed Arjuna with the [[Gandiva]] \u2013 the bow created by [[Brahma]]. In this way, Arjuna came into possession of his famous bow. Agni also gave Arjuna an incandescent chariot with four pure white horses yoked, and bearing a flag that would one-day be occupied by celestial apes of Vishvakarma. Arjuna also obtained his famous conch [[Devadatta (disambiguation)|Devadatta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/17480/what-are-the-names-of-conch-shell-shankh-used-by-the-warriors-in-mahabharata|title=What are the names of conch shell ( shankh ) used by the warriors in Mahabharata?|website=Hinduism Stack Exchange|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> and Krishna obtained his [[Sudarshana Chakra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/article/how-did-lord-krushna-acquire-sudarshan-chakra.html|title=How did Shri Krishna acquire Sudarshan Chakra ?|website=Hindu Janajagruti Samiti|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> Arjuna, directed by Krishna, waged a successful battle against Indra and helped Agni burn down the entire Khandava Vana. Indra's pride in Arjuna's success overcame his anger, and he bestowed greater powers on him. At last all gods, demons and snakes got defeated by Arjuna at this Khandava war.\n\n===Saving Mayasura===\n[[File:Krishna orders Mayasura to build a palace for the Pandavas.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Sri Krishna tells Mayasura to build a palace.]]In their demolition of Khandava, Krishna and Arjuna had saved one demon, [[Mayasura]] to build their palace.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\"/> Thus owing Arjuna a favour, and after being so directed by Krishna, Mayasura said that he would build a palace for [[Yudhishtra]]. As Mayasura was a great architect of the [[Asuras]], he soon constructed the Maya assembly hall \u2013 a gigantic palace for the Pandavas, filled with ancient books, artefacts, and jewels. This hall was famous for visual illusions. Thus, [[Khandavaprastha]] was renamed [[Indraprastha]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Verma|first=retold by Virendra|title=The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata : (the great epic of ancient India)|year=1989|publisher=Pitambar Pub.

Despite of understanding of all and being forgiven by both Yudhishthira and Draupadi; Arjuna accepted the punishment, agreed with Narada and set off on a twelve - year [[pilgrimage|tirtha-yatra]]. According to Narada, Arjuna must retire to forest and pass his days as Brahmacharin. So Arjuna retired to forest for 12 years.\n\n===Ulupi at Nagaloka===\nOne day, Arjuna was taking bath in nearby Ganga river flow. Suddenly a current in the river pulled down Arjuna. He fell through regions and reached a place. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful woman standing in front of him. The woman introduced herself as [[Ulupi]]-the princess of Nagaloka. She also told Arjuna that the current was created by her in order to drag Arjuna to her land because she loved Arjuna very much as Arjuna was the greatest archer and an extremely handsome person. Arjuna explained his situation. Ulupi told him that she knew everything. Soon Ulupi married Arjuna and he set-out to finish his pilgrimage. A son, namely [[Iravan]] was produced as the union of Arjuna and Ulupi.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hindumythologyforgennext.blogspot.com/2012/05/arjuna-and-uloopi-part-1-of-2.html | title=Stories from Hindu Mythology: Arjuna and Uloopi - Part 1 of 3| date=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101 at Manipura===\nArjuna visited other Tirthas in [[India]], including [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] and the ashrams of the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Agastya]], [[Vasishta]] and [[Bhrigu]]. He reached the palace of [[Manipur]]. Here, he met King Chitravahana's daughter, [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101|Chitrangada]]. After seeing the beauty of Chitrangada, Arjuna fell in love with her, hence he asked that the king let them marry. The king accepted Arjuna's proposal because Arjuna was extremely handsome, intelligent and attractive. According to customs of Manipura, the son of the princess would become the King of Manipura. It was mutual benefit for Arjuna and Chitrangada since [[Draupadi]] didn't want other woman equal to queen in [[Indraprastha]]. Soon, a son was born to them namely Babruvahana.\n\n===Meeting Hanuman===\nArjuna, after covering various shrines, arrived at Rameshwaram in the south. An age ago, [[Rama]] had established a Shivalinga here, seeking the blessings of Shiva before commencing his journey to Lanka to rescue his wife [[Sita]]. His army of monkeys and bears had constructed a bridge of stones and trees across the vast ocean. Arjuna gazed at the remains of this bridge that had survived. A thought struck him and he wondered aloud, \"Why did a great archer like Rama have to rely on creatures like monkeys and bears to build a bridge? Why couldn't he have instead bridged the distance with arrows?\" His fellow pilgrims shook their heads, clearly at a loss for an answer. Then, a small monkey who had been following the company for quite some distance replied Arjuna that Stalwarts like [[Sugreeva]], [[Nala]], [[Neela]], [[Angada]] and [[Hanuman]] adorned their ranks. No bridge of arrows could have withstood their weight. The monkey added \"Why, no bridge of arrows could even withstand my weight, puny as I am!\" Arjuna was quick to take up what he perceived as an implied challenge. \"Let us have a wager. I shall lay down a bridge of arrows. I am willing to burn myself if it fails to bear your weight.\" The monkey agreed. Arjuna, taking the aid of his famed quiver of inexhaustible arrows, laid down a bridge across the ocean. The monkey jumped onto it and no sooner had he walked ten paces, the bridge collapsed. Arjuna helped the monkey out of the water and asked for another attempt. The monkey agreed. Arjuna constructed another bridge, this time laying his arrows closer to each other, and asked the monkey to try again. The monkey set out on the bridge in the direction of the island of Lanka yet again but the bridge collapsed. Arjuna was ashamed of himself. Not wasting any more time, he prepared a fire and was about to step into it and give up his life, in accordance with the terms of the wager. When a youth held him back and stopped him. \"What were you about to do, o mighty prince?\", asked the boy, surprised. \"I was given a challenge and I failed. I do not wish to continue with this life now that I have faced such great shame\", replied Arjuna. The boy was aghast. \"But was there an adjudicator? Who was there to see if the challenger was playing fair? A contest without a judge is meaningless. Pray and construct another bridge and this time, I shall be the judge.\" Neither Arjuna, nor the monkey could refute the boy's argument and so they got ready for a third round. Infused with some confidence, Arjuna built a third bridge, using every bit of his ingenuity. \"There! Try crossing it now\", he said to the monkey. The monkey happily obliged. He walked on, but the bridge was still solid. \"He must have locked the arrows together better this time\", thought the monkey to himself. He began to jump on the bridge but it did not collapse. It stayed strong. The monkey was surprised. \"Let me take on the form I took while leaping across the ocean\", he thought and lo! He was large as a mountain now. Arjuna was awestruck when he saw that his challenger was none other than the great Hanuman himself. He bowed his head in reverence, realising that sooner or later his bridge would succumb to the strength of the great monkey. He was humbled. The bridge did not collapse. Not even under the weight of the now gigantic Hanuman. Arjuna was nonplussed. He could not comprehend what was happening. There seemed to be no logical explanation as to why the bridge hadn't broken yet. Apparently, Hanuman couldn't get things either. He began jumping on the bridge but it still wouldn't yield. All the while the boy was smiling. In a moment of enlightenment, it struck both participants of the contest that their adjudicator was not an ordinary boy. Arjuna and Hanuman fell at his feet and then [[Vishnu]] was standing before them. \"I am Rama, and I am [[Krishna]]. I protected your bridge from collapsing, Arjuna. Vanity and pride undo the best of men. Dear Hanuman, you should have known better than to humiliate Arjuna. He is one of the finest of warriors, perhaps the best of all bowmen in his times. How could you drive him into giving up his life?\" Arjuna and Hanuman sought the Lord's forgiveness and he blessed them. \"As an act of remorse, I shall stabilize and protect your chariot in the great battle that is imminent.\", said Hanuman. \"So be it. You shall be present on the banner of Arjuna's chariot when he rides out to battle in the great war of this age that is to come.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://talesfrommythology.blogspot.com/2011/03/hanuman-in-mahabharata.html |title = Hanuman in the Mahabharata}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching Dwarka and Subhadra===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Arjuna and Subhadra.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Subhadra,<br/>painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n\nArjuna moved to other Tirthas, including the southern regions in [[Kerala]]. Finally he reached [[Dwarka]], the place where his cousin [[Krishna]] resided. Arjuna had heard about Krishna's sister [[Subhadra]] in his childhood. Krishna, wishing to further tie their families, knew of Arjuna's visit and devised a plan to arrange their meeting. Accordingly, Arjuna disguised himself as a [[Yati]] and stayed at Krishna's palace. Arjuna was attracted to Subhadra and desired to marry her, Krishna understood Arjuna's intention and advised him to kidnap Subhadra then Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra and married with her. After this Balarama became furious upon learning of the abduction but was pacified by Vasudeva, his father, because Lord Krishna knew that whole Dwarka warriors can not defeat Arjuna alone as Arjuna was invincible and undefeatable in battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> The couple stayed in Dwaraka for a year, and then another year in Pushkar. However, Draupadi had made it clear that no other Pandava wife would be allowed to stay in her city, so Arjuna, as Krishna had advised, tricked Draupadi into meeting Subhadra as a milkmaid. Draupadi realised she had been tricked, but she forgave Subhadra and allowed her to stay in [[Indraprastha]]; allowing her to keep company with Arjuna in the four years when he was not with Draupadi.

Krishna could not take back his vow. [[Narada]] advices Gaya to approach Arjuna and first seek his assurance of protecting him, before revealing about the person set to take his life. As per Narada's advice, the king takes Arjuna's promise for his protection before revealing Krishna's vow to kill him. Arjuna, though surprised, sticks to his word to Gaya. Both Arjuna and Krishna feel very sad about the situation that each of them is going to fight against the most beloved ones. Any number of dialogues between both sides makes no dent in the situation. Intervention of [[Subhadra]], Narada, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and others fail resulting in direct combat.\nWar breaks-out and Krishna v/s Arjuna archery-duel starts. Both of them go into fierce fight. The weapons and astras used by both causes heavy destruction. Because Krishna had [[Sharanga]] and Arjuna had [[Gandiva]]. Both are undefeatable and none of them gets injured. Finally Krishna uses Sudarshana chakra and Arjuna uses Vaishnavastra. Lord [[Brahma]] appears before them and asks them to withdraw their respective destructive weapons to prevent disaster to the world. Krishna explained the intention behind fighting against Arjuna. Many of people including Balarama complained that Krishna was partial to Pandavas. Through this, he proved that he was not partial to any-one but to justice. Also he meant that Krishna and Arjuna were equal and the same. He meant that Pandavas were right followers of justice, Arjuna being the most sincere person and that's the reason why he loved them and especially Arjuna very much.<ref>''Gayopakhyanam'' by Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham</ref>\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Arjuna for Rajasuya Yaga.jpg|thumb|Arjuna on his way in Rajasuya Yaga]]\n[[File:PathRajasuyaArjunaDigvijaya.jpg|thumb|Possible route taken by Arjuna for the Rajasuya sacrifice]]\n\nArjuna was sent North by [[Yudhishthira]] to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya|Rajasuya Yagya]], so that he could be crowned [[Emperor]] of [[Indraprastha]].

Dancers like [[Urvashi]], [[Tilottama]], [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]] and [[Menaka]] entertained him. There was a huge banquet serving different varieties of heavenly dishes. Arjuna learnt song and [[bharatnatyam|dance]] from the Gandharva, [[Chitrasena (Mahabharata)|Chitrasena]]. Many divine gods gave Arjuna their weapons in form of Astras.

Arjuna used the Mohini-astra and the Madhava-astra to demolish these asuras.\n\nHe was also taken to Hiranyapura, a palace in the sky created by a witch Puloma and his asura tribe of the Kalakanjas.

Later, Arjuna arranges for Uttara to become his daughter-in-law by marrying his son Abhimanyu to her. At the same time, he prevents [[Subhadra]] from marrying Abhimanyu to Balarama's daughter [[Vatsala]], as the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]] find marriages between cousins [[taboo]]. But Arjuna and Subhadra are cousins too since Kunti (Arjuna's Mother) and Vasudeva (Subhadra's father) are brother and sister.\n\nHearing about the death of Kichaka, Duryodhana surmises that the Pandavas were hiding in Matsya. A host of Kaurava warriors attack Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors. All the warriors including [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]], [[Karna]], [[Kripa]] and Ashwatthama together attacked Arjuna to kill him but Arjuna defeated all of them multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04061.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 4: Virata Parva: Go-harana Parva: Section LXI|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> During the battle, Arjuna also killed Sangramjit-the foster brother of Karna and instead of taking the revenge of his brother, Karna took heroic flight in order to save his life from Arjuna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04054.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 4: Virata Parva: Go-harana Parva: Section LIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Abhimanyu's marriage==\n{{main|Abhimanyu}}\nArjuna saved Matsya kingdom from Kurus and brought back all the cattle, sheep etc. As a gratitude, Virata king offered his daughter to Arjuna.

Arjuna suggested Virata King to marry Uttara to his son Abhimanyu. Virata king was very much pleased with this offer. In some versions, it is also said that Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile. This was noticed by [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishtira]]. Everybody in Dwaraka agreed Arjuna's proposal and soon Balarama with his wife; [[Krishna]] with [[Rukmini]]; Arjuna, [[Subhadra]] and Abhimanyu reached Matsya kingdom.

If Arjuna would have used any one of them, war would end within a minute but Krishna wanted most of the warriors to be dead from Pandavas' side as well. Thus Arjuna fought war without using any of Pashupatastra, Vaishnavastra, Brahma-shira astra and Vajra astra.\n\n==Kurukshetra War==\n\n===Bhagavad Gita===\n[[File:Bhagvad Gita.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Lord Krishna, with Krishna as the [[sarathi]] (charioteer)]]\n\n{{main|Bhagavad Gita}}\n\nAs the battle draws close, Arjuna is overcome with self-doubt about the righteousness of the war against his own kith and kin. He is distraught at the thought of having to fight with his friends and family such as his dear teacher [[Drona]] and grandsire [[Bhishma]]. Then Krishna took charge and explained the necessity and inevitability of the war to Arjuna. This conversation is a key part of the Mahabharata known as Bhagavad gita, and is considered as a holy scripture of [[Hinduism]].\n\nArjuna plays the role of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita. As Krishna dispenses the advice, Arjuna asks the questions. The Bhagavad Gita primarily takes the form of philosophical dialogue between Prince Arjuna and [[Krishna]]. It is said that Lord [[Hanuman]] on flag also witnessed this conversation.\n\n===Battles fought at Kurukshetra===\n[[File:Death of Jayadratha.jpg|thumb|350px|Killing of Jayadratha]]\n\nArjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord [[Hanuman]] stayed on Arjuna's chariot flag.\n\nSome of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows:\n* '''Fall of Bhishma''': According to original Mahabharat, Arjuna fairly killed [[Bhishma]] on 10th day of the Kurukshetra war. Shikhandi does not have any role in this, though as per one narrative it is Shikhandi who killed Bhishma.\n* '''Death of Bhagadatta''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed [[Bhagadatta]].\n* '''Killing of the Trigartas''': On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas.\n* '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna came to know that [[Jayadratha]] blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including [[Karna]], [[Drona]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and killed [[Jayadratha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up.

The battle continued fiercely and Arjuna fairly killed Karna using the [[Anjalikastra]].\n[[File:Arjuna kills Karna.jpg|thumb|Arjuna kills Karna]]\n\n==Conquest for Ashvamedha==\nAfter the conclusion of the war, the Pandavas took charge of Hastinapura, the undivided realm of their ancestors. [[Yudhishthira]] appointed Arjuna as the Prime Minister of [[Hastinapura]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a041.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 12: Santi Parva: Rajadharmanusasana Parva: Section XLII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\nYudhishthira decided to hold the [[Ashvamedha]] Yagna, or \"horse sacrifice\", to grant them the title of ''Chakravarti'' (\"Emperor\"). Arjuna led the armed forces which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He received the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. Arjuna was the only warrior who alone conquered whole world in Mahabharat, Apart from Arjuna no one warrior ever achieved this feats. In the Ashvamedha Yagna, the horse was stopped by [[Babruvahana]]. Babruvahana defeated [[Bhima]] and killed [[Vrishaketu]] without knowing that they were his relatives and he was the son of Arjuna. Arjuna fought with Babruvahana and went on upper hand since Arjuna was invincible. Arjuna defeated Babruvahana and went to collect the horse. Babruvahana then used the divine weapon to kill Arjuna. This divine weapon would kill any person-even monstrous demons. Soon Arjuna got killed and the news reached [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101]]. She scolded him and revealed the truth that he was the son of Arjuna. With the help of [[Ulupi]], Arjuna's life was restored by a gem called Nagamani. Arjuna was very impressed with his son's bravery.\n\nArjuna built the [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] during his conquest in South India. Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple is one of the \"[[Divya Desams]]\", the 108 temples of [[Vishnu]] revered by the 12 poet saints, or [[Alwars]]<ref>''108 Vaishnavite Divya Desams: Divya desams in Malai Nadu and Vada Nadu''.

On the way, they were attacked by a group of bandits. Arjuna desisted fighting seeing the law of time.\n\nUpon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and acting on the advice of [[Vyasa]], Arjuna and other [[Pandavas]] retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant and successor [[Parikshit]] (Arjuna's grandson & Abhimanyu's son). Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]].

Arjuna was the fourth one to fall after Draupadi, Sahadeva and Nakula. When [[Bhima]] asks Yudhishthira why Arjuna isn't permitted the same, the reason given is Arjuna's over confidence in his skills. [[Draupadi]] also falls because while she claimed to love all the Pandavas equally, she had a soft spot for Arjuna. Bhima was the fifth to fall after Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The reason why Bhima fell is because he enjoyed the sufferings of other people. People may cause suffering sometimes, but not allowed to enjoy them. Nakula fell because he liked his appearance a lot instead of being royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17002.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 2|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Celestial Astras possessed by Arjuna==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Astra!!Deity!!Effect!!possessed by\n|-\n|[[Anjalikastra]]||[[Indra]]||Arjuna killed [[Karna]] using this astra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs08067.htm|title=The Mahabharata in Sanskrit: Book 8: Chapter 67|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> || Arjuna, [[Lakshmana]]\n|-\n|Suryastra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||Creates a dazzling light that would dispel any darkness about and dry up water bodies.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Jyotishka Astra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||The Jyotishka Astra could brighten a dark area.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Chandrastra||[[Chandra]], God of the Moon||This Astra could intensify the brightness such that opponents fail to see the things happening around.|| Arjuna & [[Abhimanyu]]\n|-\n|Indraastra||[[Indra]], King of Gods||Would bring about a 'shower' of arrows from the sky.|| Arjuna and [[Indrajit]]\n|-\n|Bhaumastra|| [[Bh\u016bmi]], Goddess of the Earth|| The weapon could create tunnels deep into the earth and summon jewels.|| Arjuna and [[Rama]]\n|-\n|Nagapasha||The [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]]||Upon impact, this weapon would bind the target in coils of living venomous snakes. ||[[Indrajit]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Garudastra||[[Garuda]]||A weapon that can defend against Nagaastra when attacked by the opponents.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/yuddha/sarga102/yuddha_102_frame.htm | title=Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda}}</ref>|| [[Rama]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Sauparna||||The Sauparna weapon would release crazy birds.

They did as per Drona's instructions. When they reached the lake, Drona was taking a bath; suddenly a crocodile appeared and attacked Drona. Nobody except Arjuna dared to enter the lake. Arjuna jumped into the lake and began to attack the mighty crocodile with his bare hands. Suddenly the crocodile disappeared. Drona told everyone that the crocodile was just an illusion and was created by himself to test all the princes and Ashwatthama. Drona also scolded the rest for not taking the initiative to save their teacher.

Dritharashtra and Bhishma refused this because they got worried about lives of Kuru princes as Drupada was a mighty warrior and he might kill them. When Drona was about to leave the court, Arjuna politely stopped him and vowed to defeat Drupada. Next day, all the Kauravas, along with [[Karna]] and 1 Akshouni infantry, attacked Drupada.

The test is to lift, string, and fire [[Shiva Dhanush|Pinakin]] to pierce the eye of a golden fish only by looking at its reflection; [[Drupada]] had designed this test with Arjuna in mind.

When Karna asked about his real identity, Arjuna smiled and said that he is brahmin. Then Karna praised him by comparing him with Lord [[Vishnu]]. Arjuna threatened to kill Karna which made Karna flee from battlefield.\nWhen the brothers returned with Draupadi, Arjuna joked to his mother that he had brought [[alms]]. Dismissively, and without looking because she was preoccupied, Kunti asked him to share it with his brothers. Holding his mother's orders as a divine command, he requested his elder brother to accept Draupadi. Draupadi had to marry all five of the Pandavas. Her five sons, one from each of the Pandava brothers, are known as the [[Upapandavas]]. [[Srutakarma]] is the son of Arjuna.\n\nAt this point in the Mahabharata, the Pandavas revealed that they were alive. With both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira being [[crown prince]]s, tensions were high. Under Bhishma's advice, the kingdom is split, with the Kauravas getting [[Hastinapur]] and the Pandavas getting [[Khandavaprastha]]. Khandavaprastha, however, was an extremely underdeveloped land and had [[Fertility (soil)|infertile soil]], requiring extensive [[tillage|tilling]], so the Pandavas set to work rebuilding the land by burning thousand acre of forest. Their cousins [[Krishna]] and [[Balarama]] helped them.\n\n==Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna==\nThe friendship bond of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and Arjuna is the most celebrated bond in Hindu mythology followed by the bond of [[Rama|Lord Rama]] and [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]]. According to Mahabharata, Arjuna was the incarnation of Lord Nara who was the best friend of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] and along with Nara, Lord Vishnu defeated all the demons after the churning of Ocean Samudra Manthan. According to Lord Shiva, Nara and Lord Vishnu holds the whole universe and incarnates in every Yuga to end the evil and establish righteousness. The love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna is evident from Adi Parva where after the fight in Khandava forest instead of asking any weapon or power Lord Krishna asked Indra that his friendship with Arjuna will remain forever when the latter asked Lord Krishna to ask for a boon. Lord Krishna also described his love for Arjuna in Vana Parva by saying that whoever will hate Arjuna will hate Lord Krishna and whoever will follow Arjuna will follow Lord Krishna. He even said that nobody in the whole world is dearer to him than Arjuna and he can sacrifice anything including his sons, wives and citizens just for the sake of Arjuna. During his final conversation with his father Vasudeva he told him that he wants Arjuna to perform his last rights and also said that Lord Krishna is Arjuna and Arjuna is Lord Krishna. Such was the greatness of Arjuna that the supreme god Lord Krishna was ready to sacrifice anything for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03012.htm|title=Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Burning of Khandava Vana==\nThe story, this was the first time Arjuna meets [[Krishna]]. In any case, [[Khandavaprastha]] was where Arjuna and Krishna's friendship is truly forged. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met the god of fire, [[Agni]]. Agni was in great hunger and needed to burn down the entire Khandava Vana to quench his hunger. But [[Takshaka]], the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of [[Indra]]'s. So the latter brought down heavy rains to thwart Agni's plans to burn the woods. Agni requested Krishna and Arjuna to help him realise his goal.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\">{{cite book|title=Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa.|year=2008|publisher=The Echo Library|location=Teddington, Middlesex|isbn=9781406870459|pages=518\u2013520}}</ref>\n\nArjuna asked Agni for Gandiva as normal bows were not capable to bear the strength of his arms. The three of them then invoked [[Varuna]], the [[God]] of the [[oceans]]. Varuna blessed Arjuna with the [[Gandiva]] \u2013 the bow created by [[Brahma]]. In this way, Arjuna came into possession of his famous bow. Agni also gave Arjuna an incandescent chariot with four pure white horses yoked, and bearing a flag that would one-day be occupied by celestial apes of Vishvakarma. Arjuna also obtained his famous conch [[Devadatta (disambiguation)|Devadatta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/17480/what-are-the-names-of-conch-shell-shankh-used-by-the-warriors-in-mahabharata|title=What are the names of conch shell ( shankh ) used by the warriors in Mahabharata?|website=Hinduism Stack Exchange|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> and Krishna obtained his [[Sudarshana Chakra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/article/how-did-lord-krushna-acquire-sudarshan-chakra.html|title=How did Shri Krishna acquire Sudarshan Chakra ?|website=Hindu Janajagruti Samiti|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> Arjuna, directed by Krishna, waged a successful battle against Indra and helped Agni burn down the entire Khandava Vana. Indra's pride in Arjuna's success overcame his anger, and he bestowed greater powers on him. At last all gods, demons and snakes got defeated by Arjuna at this Khandava war.\n\n===Saving Mayasura===\n[[File:Krishna orders Mayasura to build a palace for the Pandavas.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Sri Krishna tells Mayasura to build a palace.]]In their demolition of Khandava, Krishna and Arjuna had saved one demon, [[Mayasura]] to build their palace.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\"/> Thus owing Arjuna a favour, and after being so directed by Krishna, Mayasura said that he would build a palace for [[Yudhishtra]]. As Mayasura was a great architect of the [[Asuras]], he soon constructed the Maya assembly hall \u2013 a gigantic palace for the Pandavas, filled with ancient books, artefacts, and jewels. This hall was famous for visual illusions.

Despite of understanding of all and being forgiven by both Yudhishthira and Draupadi; Arjuna accepted the punishment, agreed with Narada and set off on a twelve - year [[pilgrimage|tirtha-yatra]]. According to Narada, Arjuna must retire to forest and pass his days as Brahmacharin. So Arjuna retired to forest for 12 years.\n\n===Ulupi at Nagaloka===\nOne day, Arjuna was taking bath in nearby Ganga river flow. Suddenly a current in the river pulled down Arjuna. He fell through regions and reached a place. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful woman standing in front of him. The woman introduced herself as [[Ulupi]]-the princess of Nagaloka. She also told Arjuna that the current was created by her in order to drag Arjuna to her land because she loved Arjuna very much as Arjuna was the greatest archer and an extremely handsome person. Arjuna explained his situation. Ulupi told him that she knew everything. Soon Ulupi married Arjuna and he set-out to finish his pilgrimage. A son, namely [[Iravan]] was produced as the union of Arjuna and Ulupi.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hindumythologyforgennext.blogspot.com/2012/05/arjuna-and-uloopi-part-1-of-2.html | title=Stories from Hindu Mythology: Arjuna and Uloopi - Part 1 of 3| date=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101 at Manipura===\nArjuna visited other Tirthas in [[India]], including [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] and the ashrams of the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Agastya]], [[Vasishta]] and [[Bhrigu]]. He reached the palace of [[Manipur]]. Here, he met King Chitravahana's daughter, [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101|Chitrangada]]. After seeing the beauty of Chitrangada, Arjuna fell in love with her, hence he asked that the king let them marry. The king accepted Arjuna's proposal because Arjuna was extremely handsome, intelligent and attractive. According to customs of Manipura, the son of the princess would become the King of Manipura. It was mutual benefit for Arjuna and Chitrangada since [[Draupadi]] didn't want other woman equal to queen in [[Indraprastha]]. Soon, a son was born to them namely Babruvahana.\n\n===Meeting Hanuman===\nArjuna, after covering various shrines, arrived at Rameshwaram in the south. An age ago, [[Rama]] had established a Shivalinga here, seeking the blessings of Shiva before commencing his journey to Lanka to rescue his wife [[Sita]]. His army of monkeys and bears had constructed a bridge of stones and trees across the vast ocean. Arjuna gazed at the remains of this bridge that had survived. A thought struck him and he wondered aloud, \"Why did a great archer like Rama have to rely on creatures like monkeys and bears to build a bridge? Why couldn't he have instead bridged the distance with arrows?\" His fellow pilgrims shook their heads, clearly at a loss for an answer. Then, a small monkey who had been following the company for quite some distance replied Arjuna that Stalwarts like [[Sugreeva]], [[Nala]], [[Neela]], [[Angada]] and [[Hanuman]] adorned their ranks. No bridge of arrows could have withstood their weight. The monkey added \"Why, no bridge of arrows could even withstand my weight, puny as I am!\" Arjuna was quick to take up what he perceived as an implied challenge. \"Let us have a wager. I shall lay down a bridge of arrows. I am willing to burn myself if it fails to bear your weight.\" The monkey agreed. Arjuna, taking the aid of his famed quiver of inexhaustible arrows, laid down a bridge across the ocean. The monkey jumped onto it and no sooner had he walked ten paces, the bridge collapsed. Arjuna helped the monkey out of the water and asked for another attempt. The monkey agreed. Arjuna constructed another bridge, this time laying his arrows closer to each other, and asked the monkey to try again. The monkey set out on the bridge in the direction of the island of Lanka yet again but the bridge collapsed. Arjuna was ashamed of himself. Not wasting any more time, he prepared a fire and was about to step into it and give up his life, in accordance with the terms of the wager. When a youth held him back and stopped him. \"What were you about to do, o mighty prince?\", asked the boy, surprised. \"I was given a challenge and I failed. I do not wish to continue with this life now that I have faced such great shame\", replied Arjuna. The boy was aghast. \"But was there an adjudicator? Who was there to see if the challenger was playing fair? A contest without a judge is meaningless. Pray and construct another bridge and this time, I shall be the judge.\" Neither Arjuna, nor the monkey could refute the boy's argument and so they got ready for a third round. Infused with some confidence, Arjuna built a third bridge, using every bit of his ingenuity. \"There! Try crossing it now\", he said to the monkey. The monkey happily obliged. He walked on, but the bridge was still solid. \"He must have locked the arrows together better this time\", thought the monkey to himself. He began to jump on the bridge but it did not collapse. It stayed strong. The monkey was surprised. \"Let me take on the form I took while leaping across the ocean\", he thought and lo! He was large as a mountain now. Arjuna was awestruck when he saw that his challenger was none other than the great Hanuman himself. He bowed his head in reverence, realising that sooner or later his bridge would succumb to the strength of the great monkey. He was humbled. The bridge did not collapse. Not even under the weight of the now gigantic Hanuman. Arjuna was nonplussed. He could not comprehend what was happening. There seemed to be no logical explanation as to why the bridge hadn't broken yet. Apparently, Hanuman couldn't get things either. He began jumping on the bridge but it still wouldn't yield. All the while the boy was smiling. In a moment of enlightenment, it struck both participants of the contest that their adjudicator was not an ordinary boy. Arjuna and Hanuman fell at his feet and then [[Vishnu]] was standing before them. \"I am Rama, and I am [[Krishna]]. I protected your bridge from collapsing, Arjuna. Vanity and pride undo the best of men. Dear Hanuman, you should have known better than to humiliate Arjuna. He is one of the finest of warriors, perhaps the best of all bowmen in his times. How could you drive him into giving up his life?\" Arjuna and Hanuman sought the Lord's forgiveness and he blessed them. \"As an act of remorse, I shall stabilize and protect your chariot in the great battle that is imminent.\", said Hanuman. \"So be it. You shall be present on the banner of Arjuna's chariot when he rides out to battle in the great war of this age that is to come.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://talesfrommythology.blogspot.com/2011/03/hanuman-in-mahabharata.html |title = Hanuman in the Mahabharata}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching Dwarka and Subhadra===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Arjuna and Subhadra.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Subhadra,<br/>painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n\nArjuna moved to other Tirthas, including the southern regions in [[Kerala]]. Finally he reached [[Dwarka]], the place where his cousin [[Krishna]] resided. Arjuna had heard about Krishna's sister [[Subhadra]] in his childhood. Krishna, wishing to further tie their families, knew of Arjuna's visit and devised a plan to arrange their meeting. Accordingly, Arjuna disguised himself as a [[Yati]] and stayed at Krishna's palace. Arjuna was attracted to Subhadra and desired to marry her, Krishna understood Arjuna's intention and advised him to kidnap Subhadra then Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra and married with her. After this Balarama became furious upon learning of the abduction but was pacified by Vasudeva, his father, because Lord Krishna knew that whole Dwarka warriors can not defeat Arjuna alone as Arjuna was invincible and undefeatable in battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> The couple stayed in Dwaraka for a year, and then another year in Pushkar. However, Draupadi had made it clear that no other Pandava wife would be allowed to stay in her city, so Arjuna, as Krishna had advised, tricked Draupadi into meeting Subhadra as a milkmaid. Draupadi realised she had been tricked, but she forgave Subhadra and allowed her to stay in [[Indraprastha]]; allowing her to keep company with Arjuna in the four years when he was not with Draupadi.

It falls into the open palms of Sri [[Krishna]], offering prayers to Sun god [[Surya]]. Sri Krishna gets very angry and vows to kill him. Gaya is a great devotee of Krishna. Krishna could not take back his vow. [[Narada]] advices Gaya to approach Arjuna and first seek his assurance of protecting him, before revealing about the person set to take his life. As per Narada's advice, the king takes Arjuna's promise for his protection before revealing Krishna's vow to kill him. Arjuna, though surprised, sticks to his word to Gaya. Both Arjuna and Krishna feel very sad about the situation that each of them is going to fight against the most beloved ones. Any number of dialogues between both sides makes no dent in the situation. Intervention of [[Subhadra]], Narada, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and others fail resulting in direct combat.\nWar breaks-out and Krishna v/s Arjuna archery-duel starts. Both of them go into fierce fight. The weapons and astras used by both causes heavy destruction. Because Krishna had [[Sharanga]] and Arjuna had [[Gandiva]]. Both are undefeatable and none of them gets injured. Finally Krishna uses Sudarshana chakra and Arjuna uses Vaishnavastra. Lord [[Brahma]] appears before them and asks them to withdraw their respective destructive weapons to prevent disaster to the world. Krishna explained the intention behind fighting against Arjuna. Many of people including Balarama complained that Krishna was partial to Pandavas. Through this, he proved that he was not partial to any-one but to justice. Also he meant that Krishna and Arjuna were equal and the same. He meant that Pandavas were right followers of justice, Arjuna being the most sincere person and that's the reason why he loved them and especially Arjuna very much.<ref>''Gayopakhyanam'' by Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham</ref>\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Arjuna for Rajasuya Yaga.jpg|thumb|Arjuna on his way in Rajasuya Yaga]]\n[[File:PathRajasuyaArjunaDigvijaya.jpg|thumb|Possible route taken by Arjuna for the Rajasuya sacrifice]]\n\nArjuna was sent North by [[Yudhishthira]] to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya|Rajasuya Yagya]], so that he could be crowned [[Emperor]] of [[Indraprastha]].

So all of them made for the forest where the Pandavas were living. In the course of the journey, Duryodhana abducted a lady without knowing that she was a Gandharva. Then the Gandharvas attacked all of the Kauravas and Karna-who tried to run away from battle after getting defeated by Chitrasena, but he couldn't because the Gandharvas captured all the Kauravas and Karna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03239.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Ghosha-yatra Parva: Section CCXXXIX|website=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> On knowing this, [[Yudhishtira]] asked Arjuna to free them since its Hastinapur which would be insulted.

Arjuna learnt song and [[bharatnatyam|dance]] from the Gandharva, [[Chitrasena (Mahabharata)|Chitrasena]]. Many divine gods gave Arjuna their weapons in form of Astras.

Later, Arjuna arranges for Uttara to become his daughter-in-law by marrying his son Abhimanyu to her. At the same time, he prevents [[Subhadra]] from marrying Abhimanyu to Balarama's daughter [[Vatsala]], as the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]] find marriages between cousins [[taboo]]. But Arjuna and Subhadra are cousins too since Kunti (Arjuna's Mother) and Vasudeva (Subhadra's father) are brother and sister.\n\nHearing about the death of Kichaka, Duryodhana surmises that the Pandavas were hiding in Matsya. A host of Kaurava warriors attack Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors. All the warriors including [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]], [[Karna]], [[Kripa]] and Ashwatthama together attacked Arjuna to kill him but Arjuna defeated all of them multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04061.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 4: Virata Parva: Go-harana Parva: Section LXI|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> During the battle, Arjuna also killed Sangramjit-the foster brother of Karna and instead of taking the revenge of his brother, Karna took heroic flight in order to save his life from Arjuna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04054.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 4: Virata Parva: Go-harana Parva: Section LIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Abhimanyu's marriage==\n{{main|Abhimanyu}}\nArjuna saved Matsya kingdom from Kurus and brought back all the cattle, sheep etc. As a gratitude, Virata king offered his daughter to Arjuna.

Arjuna suggested Virata King to marry Uttara to his son Abhimanyu. Virata king was very much pleased with this offer. In some versions, it is also said that Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile. This was noticed by [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishtira]]. Everybody in Dwaraka agreed Arjuna's proposal and soon Balarama with his wife; [[Krishna]] with [[Rukmini]]; Arjuna, [[Subhadra]] and Abhimanyu reached Matsya kingdom.

If Arjuna would have used any one of them, war would end within a minute but Krishna wanted most of the warriors to be dead from Pandavas' side as well. Thus Arjuna fought war without using any of Pashupatastra, Vaishnavastra, Brahma-shira astra and Vajra astra.\n\n==Kurukshetra War==\n\n===Bhagavad Gita===\n[[File:Bhagvad Gita.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Lord Krishna, with Krishna as the [[sarathi]] (charioteer)]]\n\n{{main|Bhagavad Gita}}\n\nAs the battle draws close, Arjuna is overcome with self-doubt about the righteousness of the war against his own kith and kin. He is distraught at the thought of having to fight with his friends and family such as his dear teacher [[Drona]] and grandsire [[Bhishma]]. Then Krishna took charge and explained the necessity and inevitability of the war to Arjuna. This conversation is a key part of the Mahabharata known as Bhagavad gita, and is considered as a holy scripture of [[Hinduism]].\n\nArjuna plays the role of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita. As Krishna dispenses the advice, Arjuna asks the questions. The Bhagavad Gita primarily takes the form of philosophical dialogue between Prince Arjuna and [[Krishna]]. It is said that Lord [[Hanuman]] on flag also witnessed this conversation.\n\n===Battles fought at Kurukshetra===\n[[File:Death of Jayadratha.jpg|thumb|350px|Killing of Jayadratha]]\n\nArjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord [[Hanuman]] stayed on Arjuna's chariot flag.\n\nSome of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows:\n* '''Fall of Bhishma''': According to original Mahabharat, Arjuna fairly killed [[Bhishma]] on 10th day of the Kurukshetra war. Shikhandi does not have any role in this, though as per one narrative it is Shikhandi who killed Bhishma.\n* '''Death of Bhagadatta''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed [[Bhagadatta]].\n* '''Killing of the Trigartas''': On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas.\n* '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna came to know that [[Jayadratha]] blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including [[Karna]], [[Drona]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and killed [[Jayadratha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up.

[[Yudhishthira]] appointed Arjuna as the Prime Minister of [[Hastinapura]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a041.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 12: Santi Parva: Rajadharmanusasana Parva: Section XLII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\nYudhishthira decided to hold the [[Ashvamedha]] Yagna, or \"horse sacrifice\", to grant them the title of ''Chakravarti'' (\"Emperor\"). Arjuna led the armed forces which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He received the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. Arjuna was the only warrior who alone conquered whole world in Mahabharat, Apart from Arjuna no one warrior ever achieved this feats. In the Ashvamedha Yagna, the horse was stopped by [[Babruvahana]]. Babruvahana defeated [[Bhima]] and killed [[Vrishaketu]] without knowing that they were his relatives and he was the son of Arjuna. Arjuna fought with Babruvahana and went on upper hand since Arjuna was invincible. Arjuna defeated Babruvahana and went to collect the horse. Babruvahana then used the divine weapon to kill Arjuna. This divine weapon would kill any person-even monstrous demons. Soon Arjuna got killed and the news reached [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101]]. She scolded him and revealed the truth that he was the son of Arjuna. With the help of [[Ulupi]], Arjuna's life was restored by a gem called Nagamani. Arjuna was very impressed with his son's bravery.\n\nArjuna built the [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] during his conquest in South India. Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple is one of the \"[[Divya Desams]]\", the 108 temples of [[Vishnu]] revered by the 12 poet saints, or [[Alwars]]<ref>''108 Vaishnavite Divya Desams: Divya desams in Malai Nadu and Vada Nadu''.

On the way, they were attacked by a group of bandits. Arjuna desisted fighting seeing the law of time.\n\nUpon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and acting on the advice of [[Vyasa]], Arjuna and other [[Pandavas]] retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant and successor [[Parikshit]] (Arjuna's grandson & Abhimanyu's son). Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]].

Arjuna was the fourth one to fall after Draupadi, Sahadeva and Nakula. When [[Bhima]] asks Yudhishthira why Arjuna isn't permitted the same, the reason given is Arjuna's over confidence in his skills. [[Draupadi]] also falls because while she claimed to love all the Pandavas equally, she had a soft spot for Arjuna. Bhima was the fifth to fall after Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The reason why Bhima fell is because he enjoyed the sufferings of other people. People may cause suffering sometimes, but not allowed to enjoy them. Nakula fell because he liked his appearance a lot instead of being royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17002.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 2|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Celestial Astras possessed by Arjuna==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Astra!!Deity!!Effect!!possessed by\n|-\n|[[Anjalikastra]]||[[Indra]]||Arjuna killed [[Karna]] using this astra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs08067.htm|title=The Mahabharata in Sanskrit: Book 8: Chapter 67|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> || Arjuna, [[Lakshmana]]\n|-\n|Suryastra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||Creates a dazzling light that would dispel any darkness about and dry up water bodies.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Jyotishka Astra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||The Jyotishka Astra could brighten a dark area.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Chandrastra||[[Chandra]], God of the Moon||This Astra could intensify the brightness such that opponents fail to see the things happening around.|| Arjuna & [[Abhimanyu]]\n|-\n|Indraastra||[[Indra]], King of Gods||Would bring about a 'shower' of arrows from the sky.|| Arjuna and [[Indrajit]]\n|-\n|Bhaumastra|| [[Bh\u016bmi]], Goddess of the Earth|| The weapon could create tunnels deep into the earth and summon jewels.|| Arjuna and [[Rama]]\n|-\n|Nagapasha||The [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]]||Upon impact, this weapon would bind the target in coils of living venomous snakes. ||[[Indrajit]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Garudastra||[[Garuda]]||A weapon that can defend against Nagaastra when attacked by the opponents.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/yuddha/sarga102/yuddha_102_frame.htm | title=Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda}}</ref>|| [[Rama]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Sauparna||||The Sauparna weapon would release crazy birds.
