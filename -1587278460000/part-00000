traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns, listed in order of seniority: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.  Due to their ancestry and proximity to [[Northern Nigeria]], as well as their location in the northern part of [[Igboland]], they are referred to as Northern Igbos. \n\n==Composition of Edem==\nEdem is made up of 41 villages:\n\n'''Akpa-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Oba\n* Amadiuba\n* Amadimogo\n* Amankwa\n* Dimunazu\n* Igoro Agbo\n* Igoro Ugwu\n* Isamani\n* Nkawushi\n* Obeke\n* Okiti\n* Owa-Edem\n* Uwenu na Uwani Obeke\n\n'''Ozi-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Uwenu\n* Amabunegu\n* Amamkpume\n* Amaudo\n* Amaukpa\n* Amaukwa\n* Dimoke\n* Ezi-Ozi\n* Ikwe Ezike\n* Obinegun \n* Ukpara\n* Umueyi\n* Umuoji\n* Umokoo\n\n'''Edem-Ani Zone'''\n\n* Amaenu-Edem\n* Amaezumesu\n* Amaogwu\n* Isu\n* Nkofi\n* Odojo\n* Ogbododu\n* Owere-Ugwu\n* Owereagbo\n* Ozara\n* Ubogidi\n* Umuchiagwu\n* Umuchioke\n* Uwani-Edem\nEach of the villages is headed by an [[Onyishi]] according to their culture and traditions.\n\n==Traditional Political System and Institutions==\nThe principal Edem ancestral, cultural, traditional political system and institution is Oha Edem (Edem Ruling Council of Elders) which consists of the following members to name a few: Eze Edem (The Sovereign), Onyishi Edem (The Oldest Man/Clan Head of Edem), Ossai Edem (Cultural Principal Private Secretary to Eze Edem), Atama Tazz (Chief Priest of Edem), Ndi Ishi (Zonal/Clan Heads), Asogwa (Ambassador of a Clan), Iduja (Deputy Ambassador of a Clan), Omabe/Ogbanabo (Traditional Police of the Realm & Ogueze (bodyguards) to the Eze Edem). Ogbanabo has Esato as the Senior Officer and Akaaju as the Junior Officer). \n\n[[Eze Edem]] is the Sovereign, the symbol of unity, custodian of culture and dispenser of justice within the Edem cultural political system. The Eze Edem is compelled by law to perform the Executive, Legislative and Judicial functions as they concern Edem culture. Kingship in Edem involves considerable self-denial.\n\nOnyishi Edem is drawn from Obeke Akpa-Edem, Onyishi Akpa-Edem is drawn from Owa, Onyishi Ozi-Edem from Umuokoo while Onyishi Edem-Ani is from Amaogwu. \n\nWhile Onyishi Ozi-Edem and Onyishi Edem-Ani must be the oldest in their clan, the criteria for selecting Onyishi Akpa-Edem is different. The people of Akpa-Edem felt that somebody younger and stronger will represent them better hence their Onyishi is always a much younger person compared to his colleagues from the other 2 zones. Meanwhile, the people in Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani zones believed an older, wiser and more experienced person will represent them better. \n\nWithin Oha Edem, each member has a specific role to play for e.g. the Asogwa Umuchiagwu is Ega/Oga [Provost/Messenger] Oha Edem, assisted by Asogwa Ezi-Ozi.\n\nMembers of Oha are divided into 2 categories. Category 1 is Idi-Ani which is made up of  Ndi Ishi (Onyishi). Category 2 is Oha Enu which is made up of Asogwas and Idujas. This applies to Oha Edem and also different levels of Oha in the 3 zones/autonomous communities. \n\nMembership of Oha Edem is based on hereditary positions for the relevant contributing zones/clans/families. Different zones/clans/families have their own rules/criteria for deciding who will be an Oha member. It cannot be decided by people who are not from that zone/clan/family. The process is completely independent and cannot be manipulated. \n\nThere is never a haste in replacing a deceased member/official of Oha. Whenever the zone/clan/family is ready to enthrone a replacement, so shall it be. In the case of the Eze Edem, the same principle of \"never in a haste\" also applies. It is on record that it once took nearly 25 years for a new Eze Edem to ascend the throne after the demise of his predecessor. Easy example, the current Eze Edem ascended the throne on the 16th of July 2009 while his father and predecessor passed away 10 years earlier on the 14th of October 1999. During this vacuum, a Regent was appointed by Oha Edem.\n\nEdem and its cultural/traditional institutions existed long before the Europeans set foot on the shores of modern-day Nigeria. Edem was a sovereign and fully independent traditional state long before the Europeans came into Africa. It continues to maintain that cultural independence till date.\n\n==Life and Religion==\nEdem is known for having [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indigene#English indigenes] that live very long, frequently over 100 years.  This may be attributed to the quality of life or other factors.<ref>Oldest Man in Nigeria http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2006/oct/25/national-25-10-2006-04.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118112440/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2006/oct/25/national-25-10-2006-04.htm |date=2006-11-18 }}</ref>\n\nChristianity is one of the main religions in Edem.

The people practice [[shifting cultivation]] and [[crop rotation]].\n\n[[Cash Crop|Cash crops]]: kolanuts, oil beans, [[breadfruit]], black-eyed beans, brown beans, yams, cocoyams, [[cowpea]]s, maize, cotton, and groundnuts.\n\nFruits: citrus fruits (tangerines, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges), cashews, avocado pears, guavas, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, watermelons, mangoes, pears, African star apples, black apples, blue apples, showasho and [[irvingia]](wild mangoes or bush mangoes).\n\nVegetables: light green [[amaranth]], dark green amaranth, ahihara, waterleaves, [[Vernonia|bitterleaves]], pumpkins, [[Eggplant|garden eggs]], [[Telfairia occidentalis|fluted pumpkins]], okra, red chili peppers, yellow chili peppers, [[alligator pepper]]s and black pepper.\n\nDue to the rocky nature of certain parts of Edem, another significant economic activity is the small-scale manual production of stone for construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\nNatural features that visitors can view include the Akatakata Waterfalls from Ugwu Ovo (\"Ovo hill\") down to Igoro Agbo, Okpu cave and stream in Nkawushi and a valley from Amaho down to Owa, all in Akpa-Edem.\n\nAnother major tourist attraction is the year-round hunting. The kingdom has large, thick forests where various types of wild animals can be hunted. These forests have some trees that are over a 100 years old.\n\nEdem has a beneficial temperature throughout the year. The lowest temperature is 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (66&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the hottest is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C (91&nbsp;\u00b0F), whether in the rainy season or dry season.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe five main festivals celebrated at different times of the year and, in some cases, on a zone-by-zone basis are as follows: Onunu Edem, Omabe Festival (celebrated in three stages: Uda Omabe, Ulo Omabe and Okiti Omabe), Egba Chukwu, Okputukputu Eze Edem and Edem Week.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{LGAs and communities of Enugu State}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Enugu State]]\n[[Category:Towns in Enugu

Due to their ancestry and proximity to [[Northern Nigeria]], as well as their location in the northern part of [[Igboland]], they are referred to as Northern Igbos. \n\n==Composition of Edem==\nEdem is made up of 41 villages:\n\n'''Akpa-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Oba\n* Amadiuba\n* Amadimogo\n* Amankwa\n* Dimunazu\n* Igoro Agbo\n* Igoro Ugwu\n* Isamani\n* Nkawushi\n* Obeke\n* Okiti\n* Owa-Edem\n* Uwenu na Uwani Obeke\n\n'''Ozi-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Uwenu\n* Amabunegu\n* Amamkpume\n* Amaudo\n* Amaukpa\n* Amaukwa\n* Dimoke\n* Ezi-Ozi\n* Ikwe Ezike\n* Obinegun \n* Ukpara\n* Umueyi\n* Umuoji\n* Umokoo\n\n'''Edem-Ani Zone'''\n\n* Amaenu-Edem\n* Amaezumesu\n* Amaogwu\n* Isu\n* Nkofi\n* Odojo\n* Ogbododu\n* Owere-Ugwu\n* Owereagbo\n* Ozara\n* Ubogidi\n* Umuchiagwu\n* Umuchioke\n* Uwani-Edem\nEach of the villages is headed by an [[Onyishi]] according to their culture and traditions.\n\n==Traditional Political System and Institutions==\nThe principal Edem ancestral, cultural, traditional political system and institution is Oha Edem (Edem Ruling Council of Elders) which consists of the following members to name a few: Eze Edem (The Sovereign), Onyishi Edem (The Oldest Man/Clan Head of Edem), Ossai Edem (Cultural Private Secretary to Eze Edem), Atama Tazz (Chief Priest of Edem), Ndi Ishi (Zonal/Clan Heads), Asogwa (Ambassador of a Clan), Iduja (Deputy Ambassador of a Clan), Omabe/Ogbanabo (Traditional Police of the Realm & Ogueze (bodyguards) to the Eze Edem). Ogbanabo has Esato as the Senior Officer and Akaaju as the Junior Officer). \n\n[[Eze Edem]] is the Sovereign, the symbol of unity, custodian of culture and dispenser of justice within the Edem cultural political system. The Eze Edem is compelled by law to perform the Executive, Legislative and Judicial functions as they concern Edem culture. Kingship in Edem involves considerable self-denial.\n\nOnyishi Edem is drawn from Obeke Akpa-Edem, Onyishi Akpa-Edem is drawn from Owa, Onyishi Ozi-Edem from Umuokoo while Onyishi Edem-Ani is from Amaogwu. \n\nWhile Onyishi Ozi-Edem and Onyishi Edem-Ani must be the oldest in their clan, the criteria for selecting Onyishi Akpa-Edem is different. The people of Akpa-Edem felt that somebody younger and stronger will represent them better hence their Onyishi is always a much younger person compared to his colleagues from the other 2 zones. Meanwhile, the people in Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani zones believed an older, wiser and more experienced person will represent them better. \n\nWithin Oha Edem, each member has a specific role to play for e.g. the Asogwa Umuchiagwu is Ega/Oga [Provost/Messenger] Oha Edem, assisted by Asogwa Ezi-Ozi.\n\nMembers of Oha are divided into 2 categories. Category 1 is Idi-Ani which is made up of  Ndi Ishi (Onyishi). Category 2 is Oha Enu which is made up of Asogwas and Idujas. This applies to Oha Edem and also different levels of Oha in the 3 zones/autonomous communities. \n\nMembership of Oha Edem is based on hereditary positions for the relevant contributing zones/clans/families. Different zones/clans/families have their own rules/criteria for deciding who will be an Oha member. It cannot be decided by people who are not from that zone/clan/family. The process is completely independent and cannot be manipulated. \n\nThere is never a haste in replacing a deceased member/official of Oha. Whenever the zone/clan/family is ready to enthrone a replacement, so shall it be. In the case of the Eze Edem, the same principle of \"never in a haste\" also applies. It is on record that it once took nearly 25 years for a new Eze Edem to ascend the throne after the demise of his predecessor. Easy example, the current Eze Edem ascended the throne on the 16th of July 2009 while his father and predecessor passed away 10 years earlier on the 14th of October 1999. During this vacuum, a Regent was appointed by Oha Edem.\n\nEdem and its cultural/traditional institutions existed long before the Europeans set foot on the shores of modern-day Nigeria. Edem was a sovereign and fully independent traditional state long before the Europeans came into Africa. It continues to maintain that cultural independence till date.\n\n==Life and Religion==\nEdem is known for having [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indigene#English indigenes] that live very long, frequently over 100 years.

The people practice [[shifting cultivation]] and [[crop rotation]].\n\n[[Cash Crop|Cash crops]]: kolanuts, oil beans, [[breadfruit]], black-eyed beans, brown beans, yams, cocoyams, [[cowpea]]s, maize, cotton, and groundnuts.\n\nFruits: citrus fruits (tangerines, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges), cashews, avocado pears, guavas, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, watermelons, mangoes, pears, African star apples, black apples, blue apples, showasho and [[irvingia]](wild mangoes or bush mangoes).\n\nVegetables: light green [[amaranth]], dark green amaranth, ahihara, waterleaves, [[Vernonia|bitterleaves]], pumpkins, [[Eggplant|garden eggs]], [[Telfairia occidentalis|fluted pumpkins]], okra, red chili peppers, yellow chili peppers, [[alligator pepper]]s and black pepper.\n\nDue to the rocky nature of certain parts of Edem, another significant economic activity is the small-scale manual production of stone for construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\nNatural features that visitors can view include the Akatakata Waterfalls from Ugwu Ovo (\"Ovo hill\") down to Igoro Agbo, Okpu cave and stream in Nkawushi and a valley from Amaho down to Owa, all in Akpa-Edem.\n\nAnother major tourist attraction is the year-round hunting. The kingdom has large, thick forests where various types of wild animals can be hunted. These forests have some trees that are over a 100 years old.\n\nEdem has a beneficial temperature throughout the year. The lowest temperature is 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (66&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the hottest is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C (91&nbsp;\u00b0F), whether in the rainy season or dry season.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe five main festivals celebrated at different times of the year and, in some cases, on a zone-by-zone basis are as follows: Onunu Edem, Omabe Festival (celebrated in three stages: Uda Omabe, Ulo Omabe and Okiti Omabe), Egba Chukwu, Okputukputu Eze Edem and Edem Week.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{LGAs and communities of Enugu State}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Enugu State]]\n[[Category:Towns in Enugu State]]\n[[Category:Local Government Areas in Enugu State]]\n[[Category:Local Government Areas in Igboland]]\n", "name_user": "Ifeanyionah", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edem"}

Juli 2010.</ref>\n\nLauda was quickly promoted to the F1 team, but drove for March in F1 and F2 in 1972. Although the F2 cars were good (and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal Robin Herd), March's 1972 F1 season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, where both March cars were disqualified within 3 laps of each other after just past 3/4 race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team was in decline; his big break came when his BRM teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] left to rejoin [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in 1974 and team owner [[Enzo Ferrari]] asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favourably of Lauda that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.\n\n==Ferrari (1974\u20131977)==\n{{see also|Hunt\u2013Lauda rivalry}}\n[[File:LaudaNiki19760731Ferrari312T2.jpg|thumb|Lauda practicing at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] during the [[1976 German Grand Prix]].]]\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s culminating in a disastrous start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under [[Luca di Montezemolo]] and were resurgent in [[1974 Formula One season|1974]]. The team's faith in the little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the season-opening [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentine Grand Prix]]. His first [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] (GP) victory \u2013 and the first for Ferrari since 1972 \u2013 followed only three races later in the [[1974 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]]. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive [[pole position]]s, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the [[1974 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch GP]]. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.\n\n[[File:Niki Lauda, 1975 British Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 1975.]]\nThe [[1975 Formula One season|1975 F1 season]] started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new [[Ferrari 312T]]. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years; Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the [[1975 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He also became the first driver to lap the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the N\u00fcrburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda was known for giving away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gerald Donaldson | title=Formula One Drivers Hall of Fame \u2013 Nikki Lauda | publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One web site]] | url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/221 | date= | accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike 1975 and despite tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, [[Daniele Audetto]], Lauda dominated the start of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 F1 season]], winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the [[1976 British Grand Prix|British GP]], he had more than double the points of his closest challengers [[Jody Scheckter]] and [[James Hunt]], and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It would be a feat not achieved since [[Jack Brabham]]'s victories in [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]]. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late [[Jim Clark]] since [[1963 Formula One season|1963]].\n\n===1976 N\u00fcrburgring crash===\nA week before the [[1976 German Grand Prix]] at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the {{convert|23|km|adj=on}} circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles.  Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that day would later die in Formula One incidents: [[Tom Pryce]] in 1977; [[Ronnie Peterson]] in 1978; and [[Patrick Depailler]] in 1980), but a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead.\n\n[[File:Lauda accidente2.jpg|thumb|right|Niki Lauda's car on fire]]\nOn 1 August 1976 during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with [[Brett Lunger]]'s [[Surtees]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers [[Arturo Merzario]], Lunger, [[Guy Edwards]], and [[Harald Ertl]] arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull Lauda from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In the name of glory|last=Rubython, Tom.|date=2011|publisher=Myrtle|others=Watson, John., Schleglmilch, Rainer.|isbn=978-0-9565656-9-3|location=London|oclc=757931377}}</ref>  In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live (\"I Was There -- May 21, 2019\"; \"Niki Lauda speaks in 2015\"), Lauda said, \"...there were basically two or three drivers trying to get me out of the car, but one was Arturo Merzario, the Italian guy, who also had to stop there at the scene, because I blocked the road; and he really came into the car himself, and uh, triggered my, my seatbelt loose, and then pulled me out.

He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and getting them to work properly.   After the accident he always wore a cap to cover the scars on his head. He arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising.\n\nWith Lauda out of the contest, [[Carlos Reutemann]] was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown towards [[McLaren]] driver [[James Hunt]] at the Spanish and British Grands Prix.\n\n===Return to racing===\nLauda missed only two races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. F1 journalist [[Nigel Roebuck]] recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp. He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as to not be in too much discomfort. In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings. Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair. Following wins in the [[1976 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[1976 United States Grand Prix|United States]] Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]].\n\nLauda qualified third, one place behind Hunt, but on race day there was torrential rain and Lauda retired after two laps. He later said that he felt it was unsafe to continue under these conditions, especially since his eyes were watering excessively because of his fire-damaged tear ducts and inability to blink. Hunt led much of the race before his tires blistered and a pit stop dropped him down the order. He recovered to third, thus winning the title by a single point.\n\nLauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a difficult [[1977 Formula One season|1977 season]], despite easily winning the championship through consistency rather than outright pace. Lauda disliked his new teammate, Reutemann, who had served as his replacement driver. Lauda was not comfortable with this move and felt he had been let down by Ferrari. \"We never could stand each other, and instead of taking pressure off me, they put on even more by bringing Carlos Reutemann into the team.\"<ref>Tom Rubython: ''In the Name of Glory \u2013 1976'' Myrtle Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9565656-9-3}}, p. 187</ref> Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left earlier after he won the Drivers' Championship at the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]]  because of the team's decision to run the unknown [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in a third car at the [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\n==Brabham and first retirement (1978\u20131979)==\n[[File:Lauda at 1978 Dutch Grand Prix (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] at Zandvoort (1978)]]Joining Parmalat-sponsored [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in 1978 for a $1 million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]], a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in F1 again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official. The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa. It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races. Lauda's best results, apart from the wins in Sweden and Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, were 2nd in Montreal and Great Britain, and a 3rd in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Alfa flat-12 engine was too wide for ground effect designs in that the opposed cylinder banks impeded with the venturi tunnels, so Alfa designed a V12 for 1979. It was the fourth 12-cylinder engine design that propelled the Austrian in F1 since 1973. Lauda's 1979 F1 season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix]] with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single make [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], driving for the British Formula Two team [[Project Four Racing]] (led by [[Ron Dennis]]) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the [[2008 German Grand Prix]].\n\nIn September, Lauda finished 4th in Monza, and won the non-WC Imola event, still with the Alfa V12 engine. After that, Brabham returned to the familiar Cosworth V8. In late September, during practice for the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix]], Lauda cut short a practice session and promptly informed team principal Ecclestone, that he wished to retire immediately, as he had no more desire to \"continue the silliness of driving around in circles\". Lauda, who in the meantime had founded Lauda Air, a charter airline, returned to Austria to run the company full-time.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\">{{cite news |last1=Benson |first1=Andrew |title=Niki Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolour' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46781936 |accessdate=21 May 2019 |work=BBC |date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==McLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982\u20131985)==\n[[File:Lauda McLaren MP4-2 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Five years after his first retirement, Lauda won his third title driving a [[McLaren MP4/2]].]]\nIn 1982 Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3 million salary.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\" /> After a successful test with [[McLaren]], the only problem was to convince then team sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] that he was still capable of winning. Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach Grand Prix]]. Before the opening race of the season at [[Kyalami]] race track in [[South Africa]], Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new [[FIA Super Licence|Super Licence]] required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position. The drivers, with the exception of [[Teo Fabi]], barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 79ff</ref>\n\nThe 1983 season proved to be transitional for the McLaren team as they were making a change from Ford-Cosworth power to TAG-badged Porsche turbo power, and Lauda did not win a race that year, with his best finish being 2nd at Long Beach behind his teammate John Watson. Some political maneuvering by Lauda forced a furious chief designer [[John Barnard]] to design an interim car earlier than expected to get the TAG-Porsche engine some much needed race testing; Lauda nearly won the last race of the season in South Africa.\n\nLauda won a third world championship in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] by half a point over teammate [[Alain Prost]], due only to half points being awarded for the shortened [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix]]. His [[1984 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] victory that year is so far the only time an Austrian has won his home Grand Prix. Initially, Lauda did not want Prost to become his teammate, as he presented a much faster rival. However, during the two seasons together, they had a good relationship and Lauda later said that beating the talented Frenchman was a big motivator for him.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 153</ref> The whole season continued to be dominated by Lauda and Prost, who won 12 of 16 races. Lauda won five races, while Prost won seven. However, Lauda, who set a record for the most pole positions in a season during the 1975 season, rarely matched his teammate in qualifying. Despite this, Lauda's championship win came in [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], when he had to start in eleventh place on the grid, while Prost qualified on the front row. Prost did everything he could, starting from second and winning his 7th race of the season, but Lauda's calculating drive (which included setting the fastest race lap), passing car after car, saw him finish second behind his teammate which gave him enough points to win his third title. His second place was a lucky one though as [[Nigel Mansell]] was in second for much of the race. However, as it was his last race with [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] before joining [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1985, Lotus boss [[Peter Warr]] refused to give Mansell the brakes he wanted for [[Lotus 95T|his car]] and the Englishman retired with brake failure on lap 52. As Lauda had passed the [[Toleman TG184|Toleman]] of F1 rookie [[Ayrton Senna]] for third place only a few laps earlier, Mansell's retirement elevated him to second behind Prost.\n\nThe 1985 season was a disappointment for Lauda, with eleven retirements from the fourteen races he started. He did not start the [[1985 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] after crashing and breaking his wrist during practice, and he later missed the [[1985 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]; John Watson replaced him for that race. He did manage 4th at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], 5th at the [[1985 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], and a single race win at the [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]] where he held off a fast finishing Prost late in the race. This proved to be his last Grand Prix victory and also the last Formula One Grand Prix held in the [[Netherlands]]. After announcing his impending retirement at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix]], he retired for good at the end of that season.\n\nLauda's final Formula One Grand Prix drive was the inaugural [[Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. After qualifying 16th, a steady drive saw him leading by lap 53. However, the McLaren's ceramic brakes suffered on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] and he crashed out of the lead at the end of the long Brabham Straight on lap 57 when his brakes finally failed. He was one of only two drivers in the race who had driven in the non-championship [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]], the other being {{f1|1982}} World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]], who won in Adelaide in 1985 and would take Lauda's place at McLaren in 1986.\n[[File:Niki Lauda helmet Museo Ferrari.jpg|thumb|Niki Lauda helmet from the 1970s, at the [[Museo Ferrari]] in Maranello]]\n\n===Helmet===\nLauda's helmet was originally a plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area. He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his N\u00fcrburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly. In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top. From 1983\u20131985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design.\n\n==Later management roles==\nIn 1993 Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari. Halfway through the 2001 season Lauda assumed the role of team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team. The team, however, failed to improve and Lauda was made redundant, together with 70 other key figures, at the end of 2002.\n\nIn September 2012 he was appointed [[Chairman|non-executive chairman]] of the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lauda to join Mercedes in advisory role | publisher=GPUpdate.net | url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | date=28 September 2012 | accessdate=7 October 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003074703/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | archive-date=3 October 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> He took part in negotiations to sign [[Lewis Hamilton]] to a three-year deal with Mercedes.\n\n==Roles beyond Formula One==\n[[File:Andreas Nikolaus Lauda 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 2011]]\nLauda returned to running his airline, [[Lauda Air]], on his second Formula One retirement in 1985.

Although the F2 cars were good (and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal Robin Herd), March's 1972 F1 season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, where both March cars were disqualified within 3 laps of each other after just past 3/4 race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team was in decline; his big break came when his BRM teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] left to rejoin [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in 1974 and team owner [[Enzo Ferrari]] asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favourably of Lauda that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.\n\n==Ferrari (1974\u20131977)==\n{{see also|Hunt\u2013Lauda rivalry}}\n[[File:LaudaNiki19760731Ferrari312T2.jpg|thumb|Lauda practicing at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] during the [[1976 German Grand Prix]].]]\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s culminating in a disastrous start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under [[Luca di Montezemolo]] and were resurgent in [[1974 Formula One season|1974]]. The team's faith in the little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the season-opening [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentine Grand Prix]]. His first [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] (GP) victory \u2013 and the first for Ferrari since 1972 \u2013 followed only three races later in the [[1974 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]]. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive [[pole position]]s, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the [[1974 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch GP]]. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.\n\n[[File:Niki Lauda, 1975 British Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 1975.]]\nThe [[1975 Formula One season|1975 F1 season]] started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new [[Ferrari 312T]]. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years; Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the [[1975 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He also became the first driver to lap the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the N\u00fcrburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda was known for giving away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gerald Donaldson | title=Formula One Drivers Hall of Fame \u2013 Nikki Lauda | publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One web site]] | url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/221 | date= | accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>\n\nUnlike 1975 and despite tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, [[Daniele Audetto]], Lauda dominated the start of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 F1 season]], winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the [[1976 British Grand Prix|British GP]], he had more than double the points of his closest challengers [[Jody Scheckter]] and [[James Hunt]], and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It would be a feat not achieved since [[Jack Brabham]]'s victories in [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]]. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late [[Jim Clark]] since [[1963 Formula One season|1963]].\n\n===1976 N\u00fcrburgring crash===\nA week before the [[1976 German Grand Prix]] at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the {{convert|23|km|adj=on}} circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles.  Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that day would later die in Formula One incidents: [[Tom Pryce]] in 1977; [[Ronnie Peterson]] in 1978; and [[Patrick Depailler]] in 1980), but a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead.\n\n[[File:Lauda accidente2.jpg|thumb|right|Niki Lauda's car on fire]]\nOn 1 August 1976 during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with [[Brett Lunger]]'s [[Surtees]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers [[Arturo Merzario]], Lunger, [[Guy Edwards]], and [[Harald Ertl]] arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull Lauda from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In the name of glory|last=Rubython, Tom.|date=2011|publisher=Myrtle|others=Watson, John., Schleglmilch, Rainer.|isbn=978-0-9565656-9-3|location=London|oclc=757931377}}</ref>  In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live (\"I Was There -- May 21, 2019\"; \"Niki Lauda speaks in 2015\"), Lauda said, \"...there were basically two or three drivers trying to get me out of the car, but one was Arturo Merzario, the Italian guy, who also had to stop there at the scene, because I blocked the road; and he really came into the car himself, and uh, triggered my, my seatbelt loose, and then pulled me out.

He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and getting them to work properly.   After the accident he always wore a cap to cover the scars on his head. He arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising.\n\nWith Lauda out of the contest, [[Carlos Reutemann]] was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown towards [[McLaren]] driver [[James Hunt]] at the Spanish and British Grands Prix.\n\n===Return to racing===\nLauda missed only two races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. F1 journalist [[Nigel Roebuck]] recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp. He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as to not be in too much discomfort. In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings. Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair. Following wins in the [[1976 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[1976 United States Grand Prix|United States]] Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]].\n\nLauda qualified third, one place behind Hunt, but on race day there was torrential rain and Lauda retired after two laps. He later said that he felt it was unsafe to continue under these conditions, especially since his eyes were watering excessively because of his fire-damaged tear ducts and inability to blink. Hunt led much of the race before his tires blistered and a pit stop dropped him down the order. He recovered to third, thus winning the title by a single point.\n\nLauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a difficult [[1977 Formula One season|1977 season]], despite easily winning the championship through consistency rather than outright pace. Lauda disliked his new teammate, Reutemann, who had served as his replacement driver. Lauda was not comfortable with this move and felt he had been let down by Ferrari. \"We never could stand each other, and instead of taking pressure off me, they put on even more by bringing Carlos Reutemann into the team.\"<ref>Tom Rubython: ''In the Name of Glory \u2013 1976'' Myrtle Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9565656-9-3}}, p. 187</ref> Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left earlier after he won the Drivers' Championship at the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]]  because of the team's decision to run the unknown [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in a third car at the [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\n==Brabham and first retirement (1978\u20131979)==\n[[File:Lauda at 1978 Dutch Grand Prix (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] at Zandvoort (1978)]]Joining Parmalat-sponsored [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in 1978 for a $1 million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]], a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in F1 again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official. The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa. It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races. Lauda's best results, apart from the wins in Sweden and Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, were 2nd in Montreal and Great Britain, and a 3rd in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Alfa flat-12 engine was too wide for ground effect designs in that the opposed cylinder banks impeded with the venturi tunnels, so Alfa designed a V12 for 1979. It was the fourth 12-cylinder engine design that propelled the Austrian in F1 since 1973. Lauda's 1979 F1 season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix]] with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single make [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], driving for the British Formula Two team [[Project Four Racing]] (led by [[Ron Dennis]]) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the [[2008 German Grand Prix]].\n\nIn September, Lauda finished 4th in Monza, and won the non-WC Imola event, still with the Alfa V12 engine. After that, Brabham returned to the familiar Cosworth V8. In late September, during practice for the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix]], Lauda cut short a practice session and promptly informed team principal Ecclestone, that he wished to retire immediately, as he had no more desire to \"continue the silliness of driving around in circles\". Lauda, who in the meantime had founded Lauda Air, a charter airline, returned to Austria to run the company full-time.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\">{{cite news |last1=Benson |first1=Andrew |title=Niki Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolour' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46781936 |accessdate=21 May 2019 |work=BBC |date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==McLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982\u20131985)==\n[[File:Lauda McLaren MP4-2 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Five years after his first retirement, Lauda won his third title driving a [[McLaren MP4/2]].]]\nIn 1982 Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3 million salary.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\" /> After a successful test with [[McLaren]], the only problem was to convince then team sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] that he was still capable of winning. Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach Grand Prix]]. Before the opening race of the season at [[Kyalami]] race track in [[South Africa]], Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new [[FIA Super Licence|Super Licence]] required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position. The drivers, with the exception of [[Teo Fabi]], barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 79ff</ref>\n\nThe 1983 season proved to be transitional for the McLaren team as they were making a change from Ford-Cosworth power to TAG-badged Porsche turbo power, and Lauda did not win a race that year, with his best finish being 2nd at Long Beach behind his teammate John Watson. Some political maneuvering by Lauda forced a furious chief designer [[John Barnard]] to design an interim car earlier than expected to get the TAG-Porsche engine some much needed race testing; Lauda nearly won the last race of the season in South Africa.\n\nLauda won a third world championship in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] by half a point over teammate [[Alain Prost]], due only to half points being awarded for the shortened [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix]]. His [[1984 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] victory that year is so far the only time an Austrian has won his home Grand Prix. Initially, Lauda did not want Prost to become his teammate, as he presented a much faster rival. However, during the two seasons together, they had a good relationship and Lauda later said that beating the talented Frenchman was a big motivator for him.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 153</ref> The whole season continued to be dominated by Lauda and Prost, who won 12 of 16 races. Lauda won five races, while Prost won seven. However, Lauda, who set a record for the most pole positions in a season during the 1975 season, rarely matched his teammate in qualifying. Despite this, Lauda's championship win came in [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], when he had to start in eleventh place on the grid, while Prost qualified on the front row. Prost did everything he could, starting from second and winning his 7th race of the season, but Lauda's calculating drive (which included setting the fastest race lap), passing car after car, saw him finish second behind his teammate which gave him enough points to win his third title. His second place was a lucky one though as [[Nigel Mansell]] was in second for much of the race. However, as it was his last race with [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] before joining [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1985, Lotus boss [[Peter Warr]] refused to give Mansell the brakes he wanted for [[Lotus 95T|his car]] and the Englishman retired with brake failure on lap 52. As Lauda had passed the [[Toleman TG184|Toleman]] of F1 rookie [[Ayrton Senna]] for third place only a few laps earlier, Mansell's retirement elevated him to second behind Prost.\n\nThe 1985 season was a disappointment for Lauda, with eleven retirements from the fourteen races he started. He did not start the [[1985 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] after crashing and breaking his wrist during practice, and he later missed the [[1985 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]; John Watson replaced him for that race. He did manage 4th at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], 5th at the [[1985 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], and a single race win at the [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]] where he held off a fast finishing Prost late in the race. This proved to be his last Grand Prix victory and also the last Formula One Grand Prix held in the [[Netherlands]]. After announcing his impending retirement at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix]], he retired for good at the end of that season.\n\nLauda's final Formula One Grand Prix drive was the inaugural [[Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. After qualifying 16th, a steady drive saw him leading by lap 53. However, the McLaren's ceramic brakes suffered on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] and he crashed out of the lead at the end of the long Brabham Straight on lap 57 when his brakes finally failed. He was one of only two drivers in the race who had driven in the non-championship [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]], the other being {{f1|1982}} World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]], who won in Adelaide in 1985 and would take Lauda's place at McLaren in 1986.\n[[File:Niki Lauda helmet Museo Ferrari.jpg|thumb|Niki Lauda helmet from the 1970s, at the [[Museo Ferrari]] in Maranello]]\n\n===Helmet===\nLauda's helmet was originally a plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area. He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his N\u00fcrburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly. In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top. From 1983\u20131985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design.\n\n==Later management roles==\nIn 1993 Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari. Halfway through the 2001 season Lauda assumed the role of team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team. The team, however, failed to improve and Lauda was made redundant, together with 70 other key figures, at the end of 2002.\n\nIn September 2012 he was appointed [[Chairman|non-executive chairman]] of the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lauda to join Mercedes in advisory role | publisher=GPUpdate.net | url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | date=2012-09-28 | accessdate=2012-10-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003074703/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | archive-date=3 October 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> He took part in negotiations to sign [[Lewis Hamilton]] to a three-year deal with Mercedes.\n\n==Roles beyond Formula One==\n[[File:Andreas Nikolaus Lauda 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 2011]]\nLauda returned to running his airline, [[Lauda Air]], on his second Formula One retirement in 1985.

He joined the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) executive in 1928, served as its president from 1934 to 1936, and as its secretary-treasurer from 1936 to 1960. He was elected to [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) executive in 1936, served as its president from 1940 to 1942, as its secretary from 1945 to 1947, and as its secretary-manager from 1947 to 1960. He was secretary of the [[International Ice Hockey Association]] from 1945 to 1947, and was later vice-president of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) from 1957 to 1960. He was expected to become the next president of the IIHF before his death. He graduated from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in 1917 then practiced law for 43 years as the town [[solicitor]] for [[Midland, Ontario]].\n\nDudley and [[W. G. Hardy]] led the way in revising the definition of an amateur hockey player to keep amateur players in Canada and slow the number of Canadians turning professional. Dudley negotiated deals with the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Ice Hockey UK|British Ice Hockey Association]] to govern the transfer of players internationally. He introduced contracts for [[junior ice hockey]] players, as a means to obtain development payments from professional teams seeking new talent. He supported an alliance between the CAHA and the [[USA Hockey|Amateur Hockey Association of the United States]] (AHAUS), and sought for international recognition of AHAUS as the governing body of ice hockey in the United States. He threatened to withdraw Canada from [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] if the [[International Olympic Committee]] did not accept the Canadian definition of amateur, and supported the IIHF hosting its own [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] separate from the Olympics. Dudley's role as secretary-manager of the CAHA made him influential in Canadian hockey since he served as the regular delegate to IIHF meetings, and was in charge of selecting the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada men's national team]]. He facilitated the first exhibition tour by the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union national team]] in Canada, and oversaw [[ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics]] on behalf of the IIHF\n\nDudley was committed to implementing reforms for amateur hockey, believing that they were in the best interest of hockey in Canada. He was opposed to governments funding or controlling amateur sports associations, and supported the continuation of hockey and incorporating [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] teams into the CAHA as a morale boost during [[World War II]]. Dudley was described by Journalist Jack Sullivan as a staunch and shrewd hockey official and a problem solver. Canadian journalist [[Scott Young (writer)|Scott Young]] stated Dudley was a low-key figure at first who grew to prominence by his reputation as being a busy and able volunteer. Young further stated that Dudley was a forward thinker, and had the ability to listen to a conversation and find a compromise without forcing anyone to change his mind. Young credited Dudley for dealing with reforms to amateurism, and regulations on player salaries and transfers, which led to increased interest in hockey.\n\nDudley was inducted to the builder category of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1958, and was posthumously inducted into the Midland Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was made a life member of both the CAHA and OHA, received the Gold Stick award from the OHA in recognition of service to hockey in Ontario and the AHAUS citation award for service to amateur hockey in the United States. He was named to the selection committee for the Hockey Hall of Fame, and previously sat on the same committee for the [[Original Hockey Hall of Fame]]. He and [[W. A. Hewitt]] were made the namesakes of the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]], first awarded by the [[Canadian Junior Hockey League]] in 1971.\n\n==Early life and legal career==\n[[File:Historic building in downtown Toronto on an early snowy morning.

He joined the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) executive in 1928, served as its president from 1934 to 1936, and as its secretary-treasurer from 1936 to 1960. He was elected to [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) executive in 1936, served as its president from 1940 to 1942, as its secretary from 1945 to 1947, and as its secretary-manager from 1947 to 1960. He was secretary of the [[International Ice Hockey Association]] from 1945 to 1947, and was later vice-president of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) from 1957 to 1960. He was expected to become the next president of the IIHF before his death. He graduated from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in 1917 then practiced law for 43 years as the town [[solicitor]] for [[Midland, Ontario]].\n\nDudley and [[W. G. Hardy]] led the way in revising the definition of an amateur hockey player to keep amateur players in Canada and slow the number of Canadians turning professional. Dudley negotiated deals with the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Ice Hockey UK|British Ice Hockey Association]] to govern the transfer of players internationally. He introduced contracts for [[junior ice hockey]] players, as a means to obtain development payments from professional teams seeking new talent. He supported an alliance between the CAHA and the [[USA Hockey|Amateur Hockey Association of the United States]] (AHAUS), and sought for international recognition of AHAUS as the governing body of ice hockey in the United States. He threatened to withdraw Canada from [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] if the [[International Olympic Committee]] did not accept the Canadian definition of amateur, and supported the IIHF hosting its own [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] separate from the Olympics. Dudley's role as secretary-manager of the CAHA made him influential in Canadian hockey since he served as the regular delegate to IIHF meetings, and was in charge of selecting the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada men's national team]]. He facilitated the first exhibition tour by the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union national team]] in Canada, and oversaw [[ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics]] on behalf of the IIHF\n\nDudley was committed to implementing reforms for amateur hockey, believing that they were in the best interest of hockey in Canada. He was opposed to governments funding or controlling amateur sports associations, and supported the continuation of hockey and incorporating [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] teams into the CAHA as a morale boost during [[World War II]]. Dudley was described by Journalist Jack Sullivan as a staunch and shrewd hockey official and a problem solver. Canadian journalist [[Scott Young (writer)|Scott Young]] stated Dudley was a low-key figure at first who grew to prominence by his reputation as being a busy and able volunteer. Young further stated that Dudley was a forward thinker, and had the ability to listen to a conversation and find a compromise without forcing anyone to change his mind. Young credited Dudley for dealing with reforms to amateurism, and regulations on player salaries and transfers, which led to increased interest in hockey.\n\nDudley was inducted to the builder category of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1958, and was posthumously inducted into the Midland Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was made a life member of both the CAHA and OHA, received the Gold Stick award from the OHA in recognition of service to hockey in Ontario and the AHAUS citation award for service to amateur hockey in the United States. He was named to the selection committee for the Hockey Hall of Fame, and previously sat on the same committee for the [[Original Hockey Hall of Fame]]. He and [[W. A. Hewitt]] were made the namesakes of the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]], first awarded by the [[Canadian Junior Hockey League]] in 1971.\n\n==Early life and legal career==\n[[File:Historic building in downtown Toronto on an early snowy morning.

It transparently [[encrypt]]s files, using an arbitrary directory as storage for the encrypted files.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/blog/how-encrypt-your-data-encfs-debian-8-jessie|title=How to Encrypt your Data with EncFS on Debian 8 (Jessie)|last=Falko|first=Timme|date=2017-01-14|website=[[The Linux Foundation]]|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/learn/encrypt-your-data-encfs-ubuntu-1604|title=Encrypt your Data with EncFS on Ubuntu 16.04|last=Falko|first=Timme|date=2016-05-06|website=[[The Linux Foundation]]|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>\n\nTwo directories are involved in mounting an EncFS filesystem: the source directory, and the mountpoint. Each file in the mountpoint has a specific file in the source directory that corresponds to it. The file in the mountpoint provides the unencrypted view of the one in the source directory. Filenames are encrypted in the source directory.\n\nFiles are encrypted using a volume key, which is stored either within or outside the encrypted source directory.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/rfjakob/encfs-next/blob/master/encfs/encfs.pod#environment-variables|title=ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES|last=Gough|first=Valient|date=2016-12-26|website=[[GitHub]]|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref> A [[password]] is used to decrypt this key.\n\n==Common uses==\n\n* In Linux, allows encryption of home folders as an alternative to [[eCryptfs]].\n* Allows encryption of files and folders saved to [[cloud storage]] ([[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]], [[OneDrive]], etc.).\n* Allows portable encryption of file folders on removable disks.\n* Available as a cross-platform folder encryption mechanism.\n* Increases [[storage security]] by adding [[two-factor authentication]] (2FA). When the EncFS volume key is stored outside the encrypted source directory and into a physically separated location from the actual encrypted data, it significantly increases security by adding a [[two-factor authentication]] (2FA). For example, EncFS is able to store each unique volume key anywhere else than the actual encrypted data, such as on a [[USB flash drive]], [[Mount (computing)|network mount]], [[optical disc]] or [[Cloud storage|cloud]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to that a [[password]] could be required to decrypt this volume key.\n\n==Advantages==\n\nEncFS offers several advantages over other [[disk encryption software]] simply because each file is stored individually as an encrypted file elsewhere in the host's directory tree.\n\n=== Cross-platform ===\nEncFS is available on multiple platforms, whereas [[eCryptfs]] is tied to the [[Linux]] kernel\n\n=== Bitrot support ===\nEncFS implements [[Data rot|bitrot]] detection on top of any underlying filesystem\n\n=== Scalable storage ===\nEncFS has no \"[[Volume (computing)|volumes]]\" that occupy a fixed size &mdash; encrypted directories grow and shrink as more files are added to or removed from the mountpoint\n\n=== Normal file server ===\nEncFS's encrypted directory can be located on a normal file server (via [[Network File System|NFS]], [[SSHFS]], etc.) and can be mirrored and backed up efficiently with normal file-system tools, such as [[Rsync]]\n\n=== Different physical devices ===\nIt is possible for some directories on the mountpoint to exist on different physical devices, if a filesystem is mounted over one of the sub-directories in the source directory\n\n=== Faster backup ===\nBackup utilities can back up only the files that have changed in the source directory (file synchronisation, cloud storage)\n\n=== Reduced corruption ===\nCorruption of data is more isolated. Corruption of filedata is local to a single file, and data corruption of the filesystem can be corrected with a reliable filesystem repair utility like [[fsck]].

EncFS is not safe if the adversary has the opportunity to see two or more snapshots of the ciphertext at different times. EncFS attempts to protect files from malicious modification, but there are serious problems with this feature.}}\n\n===EncFS 1.8 security concerns===\n\nThe announcement of EncFS 1.8 included several underlying design changes, acknowledging the security concerns raised in the previous audit.  However, certain concerns still remain regarding those vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=EncFS 1.8 Announcement|url=http://www.webupd8.org/2015/01/encfs-18-rc1-available-for-download.html}}</ref>\n\n==Filesystem options==\n\nWhen creating a new EncFS volume, several different options are available to customize the filesystem to suit various needs.\n\n===Cipher algorithm===\n\nEncFS uses whatever ciphers it is able to locate in various encryption libraries on the system. [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are typically available.\n\nThe cipher key length (keySize) can be selected for ciphers that support variable key lengths.\n\n===Block size===\n\nEach file is encrypted in blocks, and this option controls what size those blocks are. Each time a single byte is read the entire block it is contained in must be decrypted. Likewise, for each write the block must be decrypted, altered, and re-encrypted.\n\nThe default block size of 1024 is sufficient for most purposes.\n\n===Filename encoding===\n\nFilenames in the source directory can be plain or encrypted in block or stream mode. Block mode obscures the filename length somewhat, while stream mode keeps them as short as possible, which might save space on the source directory's filesystem depending on how that filesystem manages the directory tree.\n\n===Filename IV chaining===\n\nWhen enabled, the [[initialization vector]] for filename encryption is derived from the file's parent directories, causing two files with the same name &mdash; but in different directories &mdash; to have different encrypted filenames.\n\nIf a directory is renamed, all files and directories contained therein will need to have their encrypted filenames re-encrypted, which can be an expensive operation. This option should be disabled if heavily populated directories will be renamed often.\n\n=== Per-file IV initialization vector ===\n\nWhen enabled, each file is encrypted with a random 8-byte initialization vector, which is stored within the encrypted file in the source directory. If this option is disabled, each file is encrypted with the same initialization vector, which can make the volume key easier to break.\n\nEnabling this option makes the filesystem more secure at the cost of an additional 8 bytes per file.\n\n===External IV chaining===\n\nCauses the file data initialization vector to be derived from the filename's initialization vector chain. The same data will be encrypted differently given a different filename or directory.\n\nConsequently, renaming a file when this mode is enabled requires that either the file's random initialization vector be offset by the change in the filename initialization vector chain, or the data be re-encoded. The authors of EncFS have chosen the former route as it is considerably faster, especially for large files.\n\n=== Filename to IV header chaining ===\n\nMakes encoding depend on the full pathname. So renaming or moving means reencoding. Hardlinks are not supported.\n\n===Block MAC headers===\n\nStores a checksum with each encrypted block, causing corruption or modification of the encrypted files to be detected by EncFS. The checksum (blockMACBytes) is 8 bytes, and optionally up to 8 additional bytes of random data (blockMACRandBytes) can be added to each block to prevent two blocks with the same unencrypted data from having the same checksum. This option creates a large amount of [[Central processing unit|CPU]] overhead, as each block's checksum must be calculated when data is read (to verify integrity) or written (to update the checksum).\n\n==Secondary volumes==\n\nEncFS supports a somewhat primitive form of secondary volumes, that is, a single source directory offering different files given different passwords.\n\nIf EncFS is unable to decrypt a file with the volume key, it is ignored. If EncFS is forced to ignore an invalid password entry, the volume key will decode differently, and hence files will be encrypted and decrypted with a different key. This will present two different encrypted volumes given different passwords.\n\nHowever, it is possible that two filenames on two different secondary volumes will be encrypted to the same filename. In this case, any other file will be overwritten with a new file being created. Note that this refers only to the encrypted filenames, not the unencrypted filenames. This danger can be averted by creating one directory per secondary volume and storing files in the only visible directory after a secondary volume is mounted.\n\nAlso, if the password is changed, the volume key will be re-encoded with the new password. This will cause secondary filesystems to vanish, as the volume key will no longer incorrectly decode to the same key for a given secondary password. If the primary password is changed back, the secondary filesystems will become available again.\n\nThe EncFS author does not support this technique.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Disk encryption]]\n* [[Filesystem-level encryption]]\n* [[List of cryptographic file systems]]\n* [[List of file systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://github.com/vgough/encfs/blob/master/encfs/encfs.pod Encfs manpage]\n* [http://www.getsafe.org/ Safe: another per-file implementation for Windows and Mac OS X, with no kernel mode driver (slower), but fully open source]\n* [https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/classic Boxcryptor: Proprietary software based on EncFS for Windows, Android, and iOS]\n* [http://encfsmp.sourceforge.net/ EncFSMP: Implementation that runs on Windows and Mac OS X]\n\n{{File systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encfs}}\n[[Category:Disk encryption]]\n[[Category:Free special-purpose file systems]]\n[[Category:Userspace file systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n|name = EncFS\n|logo =\n|screenshot =\n|caption =\n|developer = Valient Gough\n|latest_release_version = 1.9.5\n|latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2018|4|27}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/vgough/encfs/releases|title=Releases - vgough/encfs|via=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n|latest_preview_version =\n|latest_preview_date =\n|operating_system = [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arg0.net/|title=Valient Gough|author=|date=|website=Valient Gough|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> [[Windows]] (\"encfs4win\" [[Porting|port]])<ref>{{cite web|title=encfs4win - an experimental project of porting encfs to the Windows world|url=http://members.ferrara.linux.it/freddy77/encfs.html|accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref> (also [http://www.getsafe.org/ Safe], an alternative [[macOS]], [[Windows]] port) and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps\n|platform =\n|genre = [[filesystem]], [[encryption]]\n|license = [[LGPL license|LGPL]]\n|website = [https://vgough.github.io/encfs/ EncFS home]\n}}\n'''EncFS''' is a [[Free software|Free]] ([[Lesser GNU General Public License|LGPL]]) [[FUSE (Linux)|FUSE]]-based [[cryptographic filesystem]].

Each file in the mountpoint has a specific file in the source directory that corresponds to it. The file in the mountpoint provides the unencrypted view of the one in the source directory. Filenames are encrypted in the source directory.\n\nFiles are encrypted using a volume key, which is stored either within or outside the encrypted source directory.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/rfjakob/encfs-next/blob/master/encfs/encfs.pod#environment-variables|title=ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES|last=Gough|first=Valient|date=2016-12-26|website=[[GitHub]]|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref> A [[password]] is used to decrypt this key.\n\n==Common uses==\n\n* In Linux, allows encryption of home folders as an alternative to [[eCryptfs]].\n* Allows encryption of files and folders saved to cloud storage ([[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]], [[OneDrive]], etc.).\n* Allows portable encryption of file folders on removable disks.\n* Available as a cross-platform folder encryption mechanism.\n* Increases storage security by adding [[two-factor authentication]] (2FA). When the EncFS volume key is stored outside the encrypted source directory and into a physically separated location from the actual encrypted data, it significantly increases security by adding a [[two-factor authentication]] (2FA).

She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring professional curators, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. One of the curators, {{Interlanguage link|Sergiy K.

In 1906, she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].\n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943.

She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring professional curators, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. One of the curators, {{Interlanguage link|Sergiy K.

In 1906, she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].\n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943. The agricultural school she organized is now known as the Lubny Forestry College.\n\n==Early life==\nKateryna Nikolaevna von Reiser, known as Katya, was born 19 February 1852 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]{{#tag:ref|Though other sources give other years for von Reiser's birth,{{sfn|\u0406\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|2016|p=27}} Astryab states Katya was 7 years old when her father died, i.e. born 1852.

(''n\u00e9e'' Donahue) O'Brien; O'Brien's father later became the Chief of Police for the City of [[San Francisco]]. (Dan O'Brien ordered the arrest of [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]] in September 1921 at the scandalous [[Labor Day]] party held by Arbuckle.) After his retirement from that office, Dan was the Director of Penology for the State of California.\n\nIn 1917, O'Brien enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] to fight in [[World War I]], serving on a [[submarine chaser]].

In 1924, O'Brien received his first starring role in the drama ''The Man Who Came Back'' opposite the English actress [[Dorothy Mackaill]]. That same year he was chosen by the famed movie director [[John Ford]] to star in ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' opposite actress [[Madge Bellamy]]. The film was an immense success at the box-office and O'Brien made nine more films for Ford. In 1927, he starred in the [[F. W. Murnau]]-directed ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' opposite [[Janet Gaynor]], which won three major [[Academy Awards]] and remains his most famous film, and also played the lead in the [[New York City]] epic ''[[East Side, West Side (1927 film)|East Side, West Side]]'' that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/georgeobrien.html|website=Golden Silents|title=George O'Brien}}</ref>\n[[File:Park Avenue Logger (1937) 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|O'Brien and [[Beatrice Roberts]] in ''[[Park Avenue Logger]]'', 1937]]\nO'Brien would spend the remainder of the 1920s as an extremely popular leading man in films, often starring in action and adventure roles alongside such popular actresses of the era as [[Alma Rubens]], [[Anita Stewart]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Madge Bellamy]], [[Olive Borden]] (with whom he was linked romantically during the 1920s), and [[Janet Gaynor]]. With the advent of sound, O'Brien became a popular star of Westerns and rarely took parts outside of the Western film genre. Throughout the 1930s, O'Brien was a consistent Top Ten box-office draw appearing in scores of Westerns, often atop his horse named Mike.\n[[File:George O'Brien in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) trailer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|O' Brien in ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'', 1949]]\nDuring [[World War II]], O'Brien re-enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], where he served as a beachmaster in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]] and was decorated several times. He left service with the rank of commander.  He later joined the [[United States Naval Reserve]] and retired with the rank of captain in 1962, having four times been recommended for the rank of admiral. Following his service in World War II, O'Brien would occasionally take featured parts in films directed by his old friend and mentor [[John Ford]], including ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'', ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'', and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''. O'Brien's last leading role was in the 1951 movie ''[[Gold Raiders]]'', with top-billed O'Brien handling the action and the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] ([[Shemp Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Moe Howard]]) doing comedy routines in a feature film more or less evenly dividing screen time between O'Brien and the Stooges.\n\nWhile serving in the Naval Reserve, O'Brien took on a project for the Department of Defense as part of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]]'s \"People to People\" program.  He was project officer for a series of orientation films on three Asian countries.  One of these films, on Korea, was directed by his old friend, John Ford. The other two countries covered were Formosa (Taiwan) and the Philippines.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn the 1920s, O'Brien dated actress [[Olive Borden]] for many years and most thought they would marry. For some reason (some say his family did not approve of Olive) they ended their relationship and he eventually married actress [[Marguerite Churchill]] on July 15, 1933. Their first child, Brian, died 10 days after his birth. Daughter [[Orin O'Brien]] became a [[double bassist]] for the [[New York Philharmonic]]. Their youngest child [[Darcy O'Brien]] was a successful writer and college professor. George and Marguerite divorced in 1948.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\n== Later years and death ==\nO'Brien suffered a [[stroke]] in 1981 and was bedridden the last four years of his life. He died in 1985 in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]].

(''n\u00e9e'' Donahue) O'Brien; O'Brien's father later became the Chief of Police for the City of [[San Francisco]]. (Dan O'Brien ordered the arrest of [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]] in September 1921 at the scandalous [[Labor Day]] party held by Arbuckle.) After his retirement from that office, Dan was the Director of Penology for the State of California.\n\nIn 1917, O'Brien enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] to fight in [[World War I]], serving on a [[submarine chaser]]. He volunteered to act as a stretcher bearer for wounded Marines and was decorated for bravery. After the war, O'Brien became Light Heavyweight boxing champion of the Pacific Fleet.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Dolores Costello-George O'Brien in Noah's Ark.jpg|thumb|With [[Dolores Costello]] in ''[[Noah's Ark (1928 film)|Noah's Ark]]'' (1928)]]\nO'Brien came to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in his early twenties hoping to become a cameraman and worked as an assistant cameraman for a while, for both [[Tom Mix]] and [[Buck Jones]].  He began his acting career in bit parts and as a stuntman. One of his earliest roles was in the 1922 [[George Melford]]-directed drama ''Moran of the Lady Letty'', most notable for starring [[Rudolph Valentino]].
