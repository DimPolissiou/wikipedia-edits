It was launched in 1900{{sfn|Wrecksite|2018}} and operated until it's wrecking on the [[Ve Skerries]], [[Shetland]] on 29 March 1930, which claimed the lives of the full crew, believed to number nine crew members. Its wrecking has been called \"the most tragic wreck in all Shetland's history\"{{sfn|Shetland Museum & Archives|}}\n\n===Wrecking===\nOn 29 March 1930, the [[Aberdeen]] [[Steamship|steam]] [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] ''Ben Doran'' ran aground on the north end of Heligoblo, [[Ve Skerries]], northwest of the island of [[Papa Stour]], [[Shetland]],{{sfn|Canmore - Ben Doran|}} in bad weather and rough sea conditions, due in part to poor coverage in nautical charts of the area, and lack of knowledge of the tides around the shallow reef surrounding the Ve Skerries which were considered unpredictable even to experienced Shetland fishermen. Another passing trawler brought news of the accident to [[Lerwick]] by 5pm,{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} after which the [[Stromness]] Lifeboat Station in [[Orkney]] was notified, and [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade's]] life-saving apparatus - a rocket propelled rope to shoot to another vessel, to allow for it to be towed to safety{{sfn|SSVLB|}} - was arranged and taken by lorry to [[Ronas Voe]]. The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" ([[Shetland dialect]]: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|2010b}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n[[File:In_Melby_Cemetery.jpg|alt=|thumb|Memorial dedicated to the crew of ''Ben Doran,'' [[Melby, Shetland|Melby]] Cemetery|left]]\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March.

For the tropical storm, see [[Wipha]].}}\n{{short description|Dispersive optical device}}\n[[File:Modified Function and structure of VIPA .jpg|thumb|527x527px|Function and structure of VIPA]]\nA '''virtually imaged phased array''' ('''VIPA''') is an angular [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] device that, like a [[prism]] or a [[diffraction grating]], splits light into its [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] components. It works almost independently of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. In contrast to prisms or regular diffraction gratings, it has a much higher angular dispersion but has a smaller [[free spectral range]]. This aspect is similar to that of an [[Echelle grating]] which is usually used in reflection, since high diffraction orders are also used there. The VIPA can be a compact optical component with high [[wavelength]] resolving power.\n\n== Basic mechanism ==\nIn a virtually imaged [[phased array]], the phased array is the optical analogue of a [[phased array antenna]] at radio frequencies. Unlike a diffraction grating which can be interpreted as a real phased array, in a virtually imaged phased array the phased array is created in a [[virtual image]]. More specifically, the optical phased array is virtually formed with multiple virtual images of a light source. This is the fundamental difference from an Echelle grating, where a similar phased array is formed in the real space. When the output light is observed, the virtually imaged phased array works as if light were emitted from a real phased array.\n\n== History and applications ==\nVIPA was proposed and named by Shirasaki in 1996.<ref name=\"Shirasaki1996\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirasaki |first1=M. |title=Large angular dispersion by a virtually imaged phased array and its application to a wavelength demultiplexer |journal=Optics Letters |date=1996 |volume=21 |issue=5|pages=366\u20138 |bibcode=1996OptL...21..366S |doi=10.1364/OL.21.000366 |pmid=19865407 }}</ref> The VIPA was initially of particular interest in the field of optical communications technology.

One side (light input side) of the glass plate is coated with a 100% reflective mirror and the other side (light output side) is coated with a highly reflective but partially transmissive mirror. The side with the 100% reflective mirror has an [[anti-reflection coating|anti-reflection coated]] light entrance area, through which a light beam enters the glass plate. The input light is line-focused at the partially transmissive mirror on the light output side. A typical line-focusing lens is a [[cylindrical lens]], which is also part of the VIPA. The light beam is diverging after the [[beam waist]] located at the line-focused position.\n\nAfter the light enters the glass plate through the light entrance area, the light is reflected at the partially transmissive mirror and the 100% reflective mirror, and thus the light travels back and forth between the partially transmissive mirror and the 100% reflective mirror.\n\nWhen the light beam is reflected each time at the partially transmissive mirror, a small portion of the light power passes through the mirror and travels away from the glass plate. For a light beam passing through the mirror after multiple reflections, the position of the line-focus can be seen in the virtual image when observed from the light output side. Therefore, this light beam travels as if it originated at a virtual light source located at the position of the line-focus and diverged from the virtual light source. The positions of the virtual light sources for all the transmitted light beams automatically align along the normal to the glass plate with a constant spacing, that is, a number of virtual light sources are superimposed to create an optical phased array. Due to the [[Interference (optics)|interference]] of all the light beams, the phased array emits a [[collimated light]] beam in one direction, which is at a wavelength dependent angle, and therefore, an angular dispersion is produced.\n\n== Wavelength resolution ==\nSimilarly to the resolving power of a diffraction grating, which is determined by the number of the illuminated grating elements and the order of diffraction, the resolving power of a VIPA is determined by the reflectivity of the back surface of the VIPA and the thickness of the glass plate. For a fixed thickness, a high reflectivity causes light to stay longer in the VIPA. This creates more virtual sources of light and thus increases the resolving power. On the other hand, with a lower reflectivity, the light in the VIPA is quickly lost, meaning fewer virtual sources of light are superimposed. This results in lower resolving power.\n\nFor large angular dispersion with high resolving power, the dimensions of the VIPA should be accurately controlled. Fine tuning of the VIPA characteristics was demonstrated by developing an elastomer-based structure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Metz |first1=P. |last2=Block |first2=H. |last3=Behnke |first3=C. |last4=Krantz |first4=M. |last5=Gerken |first5=M. |last6=Adam |first6=J. |title=Tunable elastomer-based virtually imaged phased array |journal=Optics Express |date=2013 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=3324\u201335 |bibcode=2013OExpr..21.3324M |doi=10.1364/OE.21.003324 |pmid=23481792 }}</ref>\n\nA constant reflectivity of the partially transmissive mirror in the VIPA produces a [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]] power distribution when the output light is imaged onto a screen, which has a negative effect on the wavelength selectivity.

It works almost independently of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. In contrast to prisms or regular diffraction gratings, it has a much higher angular dispersion but has a smaller [[free spectral range]]. This aspect is similar to that of an [[Echelle grating]] which is usually used in reflection, since high diffraction orders are also used there. The VIPA can be a compact optical component with high [[wavelength]] resolving power.\n\n== Basic mechanism ==\nIn a virtually imaged [[phased array]], the phased array is the optical analogue of a [[phased array antenna]] at radio frequencies. Unlike a diffraction grating which can be interpreted as a real phased array, in a virtually imaged phased array the phased array is created in a [[virtual image]]. More specifically, the optical phased array is virtually formed with multiple virtual images of a light source. This is the fundamental difference from an Echelle grating, where a similar phased array is formed in the real space. When the output light is observed, the virtually imaged phased array works as if light were emitted from a real phased array. \n\n== History and applications ==\nVIPA was proposed and named by Shirasaki in 1996.<ref name=\"Shirasaki1996\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirasaki |first1=M. |title=Large angular dispersion by a virtually imaged phased array and its application to a wavelength demultiplexer |journal=Optics Letters |date=1996 |volume=21 |issue=5|pages=366\u20138 |bibcode=1996OptL...21..366S |doi=10.1364/OL.21.000366 |pmid=19865407 }}</ref> The VIPA was initially of particular interest in the field of optical communications technology.

Fine tuning of the VIPA characteristics was demonstrated by developing an elastomer-based structure <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Metz |first1=P. |last2=Block |first2=H. |last3=Behnke |first3=C. |last4=Krantz |first4=M. |last5=Gerken |first5=M. |last6=Adam |first6=J. |title=Tunable elastomer-based virtually imaged phased array |journal=Optics Express |date=2013 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=3324\u201335 |bibcode=2013OExpr..21.3324M |doi=10.1364/OE.21.003324 |pmid=23481792 }}</ref>. \n\nA constant reflectivity of the partially transmissive mirror in the VIPA produces a [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]] power distribution when the output light is imaged onto a screen, which has a negative effect on the wavelength selectivity. This can be improved by providing the partially transmissive mirror with a linearly decreasing reflectivity. This leads to a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like power distribution on a screen and improves the wavelength selectivity or the resolving power <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shirasaki |first1=M. |last2=Akhter |first2=A.

Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, the Explorer was the first four-door SUV produced by Ford, replacing the two-door [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]. Six generations of the Explorer have been produced. The sixth generation  was unveiled in January 2019/2020. As with the [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]], the Explorer derives its name from a trim package used on the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]], used from 1967 to 1986. Originally slotted below the full-size [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]] in the Ford truck line, the current Explorer is slotted between the [[Ford Edge|Edge]] and standard-wheelbase [[Ford Expedition ]].\n\nFor its first two generations, the Explorer was produced in both two-door (as the ''Explorer Sport'') and four-door configurations. Upon the introduction of the third generation, the Explorer was produced exclusively as a four-door SUV; the Explorer. The Sport name was resurrected in 2011 for the 2012 year model, but as a performance version of the standard four-door Explorer. The Explorer has been offered with a number of powertrain layouts during its production. The first four generations offered rear-wheel drive as standard, with part-time four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options; the fifth generation offered front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, while the sixth generation reverted to rear-wheel drive with optional all-wheel drive.\n\nDuring its production, numerous variants of the Explorer have been marketed, with Lincoln-Mercury selling the four-door Explorer as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] (1996\u20132010) and the [[Lincoln Aviator]] (2002\u20132005; 2019\u2013); Mazda sold the Explorer Sport as the Mazda Navajo (1990\u20131994). The [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size [[pickup truck]] derived from the four-door Explorer; two generations were produced from 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/fmc/ford-motor-company-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-usa-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-louisville-assembly-plant-louisville-kentucky-usa/ |title=Ford Louisville |work=Fordauthority.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> to 2010. For police use, Ford developed the '''Ford Police Interceptor Utility''' from the fifth-generation Explorer (replacing the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]); a specially modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is also available from Ford Fleet for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]].\n\n==First generation (1991\u20131994)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (UN46)\n| aka = [[#Mazda Navajo (1991-1994)|Mazda Navajo]]\n| image = '91-'94 Ford Explorer.jpg\n| caption = First-generation Ford Explorer\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, United States ([[Louisville Assembly Plant]])<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri, United States ([[St. Louis Assembly]])<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], Venezuela ([[Valencia Assembly]])\n| production = February 1990 \u2013 November 1994<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/24/news/mn-9479|title=Documents Show Ford's Concerns Over Explorer|work=latimes|date=August 24, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com/history/default.cfm |title=Ford Explorer Rollover History Tire Recall Chronology |publisher=Willis Law Firm |accessdate=September 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919074742/http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com/history/Default.cfm |archivedate=September 19, 2015  }}</ref>\n| model_years = 1991\u20131994\n| body_style = 3-door [[SUV]]<br />5-door [[SUV]]\n| engine = 4.0 L OHV ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]\n| transmission = 5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = 3-Door: {{Convert|102.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|111.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 3-Door: {{Convert|174.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|184.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|70.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 3-Door: {{Convert|67.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|67.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Eddie Bauer: {{Convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Mazda Navajo]]<br />[[Ford Ranger (North America)#First generation|Ford Ranger]]<br />[[Ford Bronco II]]\n}}\n[[File:1994 Ford Explorer Sport rear 7.28.18.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Ford Explorer Sport rear]]\n[[File:1992 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer (6005113836).jpg|left|thumb|1992 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer]]\n[[File:1993 Explorer Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nThe Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 for the 1991 model year.  To better compete against the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] mid-size sport-utility vehicles, Ford sought to replace the Ford Bronco II with a vehicle sized closer to its competitors. In an effort to attract family buyers, a four-door version was developed alongside the two-door (launched the same month as the four-door S-10 Blazer).\n\nAs with the Ford Bronco II, the first-generation Ford Explorer shares its chassis and underpinnings with the first-generation (1983-1992) Ford Ranger. In comparison to the Bronco II, the Explorer is far larger, with the two-door Explorer Sport gaining 12.6 inches in length and 2.1 inches of width; a four-door is {{Convert|22.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer and {{Convert|730|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the Ford Explorer has a large degree of commonality with the Ford Ranger, sharing its front bumper, fenders (modified), headlights, grille, and wheels; with the exception of its steering wheel hub, the Explorer shares its entire dashboard with the 1989-1992 Ford Ranger. In a major change from the Bronco II, the Explorer was given its own front door stampings. In addition for creating a four-door layout, the lack of commonality with the Ranger allowed for two major aerodynamic improvements; along with the elimination of exterior drip rails (by wrapping the doors into the roof), the sideview mirrors were integrated onto the doors (rather than bolted on).\n\n=== Chassis ===\nSharing its engine with the 4.0L Mustang and four-wheel drive Ford Aerostar, the Explorer was fitted with a German-produced {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne'']] V6 as the sole engine offering, replacing the previous 2.9 L V6.  A Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]] overdrive automatic transmission. For 1993, the engine output was increased to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlong with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with various configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, powered by a [[Borg Warner]] 13\u201354 transfer case.  In addition to a manually shifted transfer case, Ford offered \"Touch Drive\" electronic push-button shifting; both were \"shift-on-the-fly\" designs that allowed the vehicle to be shifted from [[two-wheel drive]] to \"four-high\" at any speed and into \"four-low\" when the vehicle was stopped.  All Explorers were equipped with the [[Ford 8.8 axle]] in either a limited slip differential, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB (\"[[Twin Traction Beam]]\") [[Dana 35]] with some [[Dana 44|Dana 44-spec]] components.\n\n=== Trim ===\nAt its launch, the Ford Explorer followed the Aerostar, Bronco, Econoline, F-Series, and Ranger in model trim. The XL was sold as the base trim, with XLT as the upper range, with the outdoors-themed [[Eddie Bauer]] trim as the top trim.  The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Sport was offered solely on the two-door body style.  Offering black lower bodywork and grille and alloy wheels, the Sport was intended as a replacement for the Bronco II.  From 1990 to 1994,<ref>{{cite book|title=Snow Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iA3VKGz_rOoC&pg=RA1-PA84|date=October 1990|page=84|issn=0896-758X}}</ref> Mazda marketed the two-door Ford Explorer as the Mazda Navajo; the model was awarded the 1991 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' [[Truck of the Year]] award.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Limited was introduced for 1993 as a luxury-trim model slotted above the Eddie Bauer. Largely introduced as a competitor to the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], the Explorer Limited was offered only as a four-door with an automatic transmission. Distinguished by its color-matched grille, headlight trim, and model-specific bodywork and wheels, the Limited was offered with several model-specific features, including automatic headlights, an [[Automatic Dimming Mirror|auto-dimming rearview mirror]], [[foglamps]], and center roof console (with compass and outside thermometer).\n\n==Second generation (1995\u20132001)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation (UN105/UN150)\n|image = 1998 Ford Explorer XLT 4.0L, front 11.22.19.jpg\n|aka = Ford Explorer Sport (2-door)\n|production  = November 1994 \u2013 December 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA146EA867E34&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLES : Enduring style or 'flash in pan'? |website=Nl.newsbank.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref><br />November 1994\u2013July 2003 for Sport\n|model_years = 1995\u20132001 (5-door)<br />1995\u20132003 (3-door)\n|assembly    = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, United States ([[Louisville Assembly Plant]])<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri, United States<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], Venezuela ([[Valencia Assembly]])\n|related     = [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#First generation (2001\u20132005)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer]]\n|body_style  = 2-door [[SUV]] (1995\u20132003)<br />5-door [[SUV]] (1995\u20132001)\n|layout      = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n|engine      = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' [[OHV]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (1995\u20132000)<br />4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne]]'' [[SOHC]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (1997\u20132003)<br />5.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford 302 engine|Windsor]]'' [[OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] (1996\u20132001)\n|transmission = 5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1|M5OD-R1]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]] (4.0 L OHV)<br />5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1HD|M5OD-R1HD]]'' (2001\u20132003 Explorer Sport)<br />4-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#4R55E|4R55E]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (4.0 L 1995\u20131996)<br />4-speed ''[[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (V-8 models)<br />5-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55E]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (4.0 L 1997\u20132001) \n|wheelbase = 1995\u201397 5-door: {{Convert|111.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u20132001 5-door: {{Convert|111.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995\u201399 3-door: {{Convert|101.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2000\u201303 3-door: {{Convert|101.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1995\u20132001 5-door: {{Convert|190.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />1995\u201397 3-door: {{Convert|178.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u201399 3-door: {{Convert|180.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2000\u201303 3-door: {{Convert|180.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{Convert|70.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{Convert|67.0|-|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer = Bob Aikins (1992)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1996 Ford Explorer XLT V6 (6310574836) (cropped).jpg\n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Ford Explorer XLT (Europe)\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition - 16312869163.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe second-generation Ford Explorer made its debut in late 1994 as a 1995 model.  Retaining the same footprint as its predecessor, the 1995 Ford Explorer underwent extensive modifications to its chassis to improve its road manners.  In an effort to better differentiate the model line from the Ford Ranger, Ford stylists redesigned the vehicle, giving the Explorer a model-specific exterior.  As with its predecessor, the second generation was sold in both three-door and five-door configurations.  Rear-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive offered as an option.\n\nFollowing the January 2001 introduction of the third-generation Four-door Ford Explorer, this Explorer became a stand-alone model on the second-generation design; the Explorer Sport was produced through the 2003 model year.\n\nThis generation of the Ford Explorer marks the debut of the 1997 [[Mercury Mountaineer]], introduced in 1996 by Mercury.  In early 2000, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] was introduced, which was a mid-size pickup truck; offered with a crew cab with a short pickup bed, the Sport Trac was based on the two-door Explorer.  The Explorer Sport Trac was produced through the 2005 model year (until it was redesigned for 2006). The 2006 Ford Explore Sport Trac, was developed until the year 2010.\n\nOutside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs.

Alongside similar changes in development for the [[Ford Ranger (North America)#Third generation (1998\u20132012)|1998 Ford Ranger]], the long-running [[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]/[[Twin Traction Beam]] front suspension was retired in favor of a [[Double wishbone suspension#Short long arms suspension|short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone]] front suspension configuration.  Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components, the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nThe optional engine of the Ford Ranger and Ford Aerostar, the 160&nbsp;hp 4.0 L V6 was carried over from the first-generation Ford Explorer. To match the V8 engine of the similar-sized [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]], for the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a 5.0 L V8 as an option. Initially available on rear-wheel drive XLT models, the availability of the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 was expanded to many versions of the Four-door Explorer, and came standard with all-wheel-drive starting in 1997.  For 1997, revised cylinder heads increased output of the 5.0 L V8 to {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Following the January 1996 introduction of the 4.6 L SOHC V8 by the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]] and [[Ford E-Series|E-Series]], the Explorer became the final vehicle sold by Ford Motor Company sold with a gasoline pushrod V8.\n\nFor 1997, the Ford Explorer gained a third engine, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0 L Cologne V6.  Using a common displacement with the pushrod 4.0 L V6, the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC V6 rivaled the V8 in engine output.  Offered as standard equipment on the top-trim Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, the engine became an option on all other versions of the Explorer's and v6 Mustang. For 2001, the pushrod V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC becoming the standard engine in all versions of the Explorer and 2005-2010 Mustang (and the sole engine of the 2-door Explorer XLT Sport).\n\nFor 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Engine\n!Production\n!Configuration\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n!Transfer Case\n\n|-\n|Ford [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne V6'']]\n|1995-2000\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV 12V V6\n|{{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed manual (Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|''M5OD-R1'']])\n4-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#4R44E/4R55E|''4R55E'']]); 1995-1996\n\n5-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|''5R55E'']]); 1997-2000\n|Borg Warner 44-05 Electric Shift ''Control Trac''\n\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne V6]]''\n|1997-2003\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 12V V6\n|{{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|254|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed manual (Mazda ''M5OD-R1HD''); 2001-2003 Explorer Sport\n5-speed automatic (Ford ''5R55E'') \n|Borg Warner 44-05 Electric Shift ''Control Trac''; 1997-2001\nBorg Warner 13-54 Electric Shift; 2001-2003 Explorer Sport\n\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford windsor engine#302|Windsor 5.0 L V8]]'' \n|1996-2001\n|{{Convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV 16V V8\n|{{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|4-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]])\n|Borg Warner 44-04 Full-Time AWD\n|}\nA Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with OHV V6 engine. The SOHC did not receive the 5-speed until 2000, but it was a stronger unit than the one behind the OHV. All V8 examples were equipped with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Mustang, and Crown Victoria). \n\nThe four-wheel drive system was redesigned for the 1995 Explorer. \nFor the V6 models, in place of Touch Drive from the previous generation, [[ControlTrac]] was an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, with software controlling a multi-disc clutch (in place of a center differential). Along with traditional two-wheel drive and high and low-range four-wheel drive, \"Auto\" mode allowed software to maintain the amount of torque sent to the front wheels; if the front axle begins to spin slower, torque is shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved. Similar to TouchDrive, ControlTrac is dash-controlled, with a rotary selector for two-wheel drive (1995-1996, 2001-2003 Sports), auto (1997-2001), high range, and low range. \n\nThe V8 models came equipped with a different full-time AWD system, without the 4x4 High-Range/Low-Range feature. The system required no driver input and torque distribution was entirely managed by a viscous clutch with a 40/60 split.\n\n=== Body ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1999-01 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer.jpg\n| image2 = Ford Explorer (2).jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Ford Explorer\n}}\nWhile visibly similar to its predecessor, many exterior panels from the 1995 Ford Explorer were changed, with only the roofline and the side doors carrying over.  As part of the changes related to the redesigned front suspension, the entire front fascia was redesigned, with the Explorer gaining model-distinct styling.  In a styling theme that would be used in several other Ford small trucks, the 1995 Explorer was given an oval grille; the headlamps were changed from rectangular to oval as well, wrapping into the fenders.  Depending on trim, the grille and bumpers were painted gray (XLT), body color (Limited/Sport), or chromed.  In contrast to the front fascia, the rear fascia saw relatively few changes, with the rear bumper nearly unchanged.  Along with slightly reshaped taillamps (with amber turn signals), the 1995 Ford Explorer marked the debut of a neon CHMSL (center brake light).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1084360/Ford-Explorer.html|title=1995 Explorer first production vehicle to use a neon stop lamp|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the redesigned exterior, the interior of the second-generation Ford Explorer was given a redesign.  Maintaining commonality with the Ranger, the Explorer was given a new dashboard (marking the debut of dual airbags in an American-produced SUV), a new instrument panel; to improve user ergonomics, the Ford Explorer introduced a double-DIN radio panel and rotary-style climate controls.\n\nFor 1997, a third-row seat was introduced as an option; expanding seating to seven passengers, the design was only offered in export markets.\n\nFor 1998, the exterior of the Ford Explorer was given a mid-cycle update.  Distinguished by the addition of fender flares, the rear fascia was restyled, with larger taillamps; to better accommodate export, the license plate was shifted from the bumper to the liftgate; the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version.  16-inch wheels replaced 15-inch wheels (shared with the Ranger).  For 1999, the front bumper was redesigned, allowing for larger lower grille and fog lights.\n\nThe interior was given redesigned front and rear seats, along with second-generation airbags; side airbags were introduced (as an option).  Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system.\n\n=== Trim ===\nAt its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade.  Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited.  For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999).\n\nIn contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature.  While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level.  In 1995, the Expedition trim was introduced; roughly the 3-door equivalent of the Eddie Bauer, the trim was discontinued at the end of the model year as Ford reserved the name for the [[Ford Expedition]] full-size SUV (which entered production in mid-1996).\n\nFor 1998, the Explorer Sport became the sole version of the three-door; following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Explorer Sport became a distinct model through the 2003 model year.\n{{-}}\n\n==Third generation (U152; 2002\u20132005)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation (U152)\n|layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]] / [[all-wheel drive]]\n|assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[United States]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo]], [[Venezuela]]\n|image = 2002-2005_Ford_Explorer_--_06-16-2011.jpg\n|production = November 2000\u2013June 2005\n|model_years = 2002\u20132005\n|body_style = 4-door [[SUV]]\n|engine = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne]]'' [[V6]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine#2-valve|16-valve Modular]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 5-speed [[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1HD|M5OD-R1HD]] [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />5-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55S]] automatic\n|wheelbase = 2002\u201303: {{Convert|113.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />2004\u201305: {{Convert|113.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{Convert|189.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{Convert|72.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{Convert|71.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related =[[#Explorer Sport variation|Ford Explorer Sport]]<br />[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#First generation (2001\u20132005)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Lincoln Aviator]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer#Second generation (2002\u20132005)|Mercury Mountaineer]]\n| designer = Edward Golden (1997)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Truby|first1=Mark |title=Ford Refines 2002 Explorer |department=Explorer Forum|newspaper=[[The Detroit News]] |date=August 4, 2000}}{{vn|date=September 2019|reason=Never was a valid URL}}</ref>\n}}The third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 (as an early 2002 model). The U152 program began in 1995, with the final design being chosen in 1997 and frozen for production in February 1998, with development ending in 2000. The primary objective behind the third-generation Ford Explorer was to make the vehicle line more competitive in both domestic and export markets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20010326/ANE/103260845#axzz2hlp6op7Q|title=Ford Explorer project leader aimed at a global standard|work=Automotive News|date=March 26, 2001}}</ref>  Along with tuning the Explorer for higher-speed European driving, the Explorer was benchmarked to lead against the [[Lexus RX]]300 and the then-in-development [[Volkswagen Touareg]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:2002 Ford Explorer (UT) XLT wagon (2015-06-25) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Explorer XLT (Australia)]]\nTo make the Explorer more competitive, Ford shifted away from typical SUV design, abandoning the use of the Ford Ranger chassis architecture in favor of designing a purpose-built platform.  As part of the change, the Explorer became only the second rear-wheel drive American Ford platform fitted with four-wheel independent suspension (behind the MN12 platform).  In another major change, the third-generation Explorer was developed solely as a five-door vehicle. Retaining the previous-generation chassis architecture, the three-door Explorer Sport continued production through the 2003 model year; the Explorer Sport Trac four-door pickup truck continued through 2005.\n\nThe third-generation Ford Explorer was marketed by all three divisions of Ford Motor Company: by Mercury as the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln marketed the third-generation Explorer from 2002 to 2005 as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe third-generation is based on the body-on-frame [[Ford U platform#U1|Ford UN152 platform]].  No longer derived from the Ford Ranger, the UN152 chassis was designed specifically for the five-door Explorer and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts.  In a major shift from its predecessors, the third-generation Explorer adopted a four-wheel [[independent suspension]] configuration, never before used on a Ford truck (on American-produced SUVs, fully independent suspension was previously exclusive to the [[Hummer H1]]).  Similar to the layout used on the Ford MN12-chassis cars (1989-1998 Thunderbird/Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII), each rear wheel was connected to the rear-axle differential with two half-shafts.\n\nWhile the third-generation Ford Explorer was in development during the late 1990s a controversy involving the [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy|Explorer and Firestone tires]] developed, thus the increased stability of the configuration was designed in part to reduce rollover risk.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/business/explorer-model-raises-doubts-about-safety.html?p=&pagewanted=all|title=Explorer Model Raises Doubts About Safety|author=Bradsher, Keith|date=April 26, 2001|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"autosafety.org\" />  In another change, Firestone tires (which had caused the rollovers and crashes of the Ford Explorers)  were not made available on any version of the third-generation Explorer.  Ford's AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control) system became available as a standard feature on the Explorer for the 2005 model year.\n\nAlong with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive; the latter was offered on the Explorer for the first time.\n\nCarried over from the previous generation, the base engine for the third-generation Explorer was a {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L V6.  Becoming the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt to the [[Ford Modular engine|Modular V8]], the third-generation Explorer offered a {{convert|239|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6 L SOHC V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis) as its optional engine.  A five-speed manual transmission was offered for 2002 before its discontinuation; as of the 2020 model year, it is the final year a Ford Explorer was available with a manual transmission.  As an option for both the 4.0L and 4.6L V8 engines, the Ford 5R55 transmission was offered, becoming standard from 2003 to 2005.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Engine\n!Production\n!Configuration\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne V6]]''\n|2002-2005\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 12V V6\n|{{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} \n|{{convert|254|lbft|Nm||abbr=on}}\n|Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|''M5OD-R1HD'']] 5-speed manual (2002 only)\nFord 5R55 5-speed automatic\n|-\n|Ford [[Ford Modular engine#4.6 L|''Modular V8'']]\n|2002-2005\n|{{Convert|281|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 16V V8\n|{{convert|238|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4750 rpm\n|{{convert|282|lbft|Nm||abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm\n|Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55]] 5-speed automatic\n|}\n\n=== Body ===\nIn contrast with the second-generation (a major revision of the 1991-1994 generation), the exterior and interior of the third-generation Ford Explorer were completely new designs. While sharing a number of design elements with the 1997 F-Series and Ford Expedition, the Ford Explorer also served as the introduction of a new design theme for several Ford vehicles; the 2003 Ford Expedition, the Ford Freestar, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred would share various elements of the 2002 Ford Explorer design.  Retaining nearly the same proportions as the first two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter in length and two inches wider, gaining two inches in wheelbase.\n\nWith the addition of independent rear suspension, several functional changes were brought as part of the redesign.  The cargo floor was lowered several inches, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of total cargo room.  Coinciding with the lower cargo floor, on nearly all models, a folding third-row seat was either standard or an option, bringing seating capacity to seven.  The rear liftgate was redesigned, with the upper hatch enlarged.\n\n=== Trim ===\nFord produced the third generation Explorer in five trim levels: XLS, XLT, NBX, Eddie Bauer, and Limited.  Slotted below the XLS were two major trim packages, Sport Value, Sport Choice, with Sport Premium between XLS and XLT.  The outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer continued production with a two-tone exterior (with a tan lower body); the Limited wore a monochromatic body. The NBX trim was only made for 2003 and 2004, and was a loaded up XLT with Eddie Bauer-esque features. It was more like a bang-for-your-buck Eddie Bauer model rather than an actual trim level, as it didn't really set itself apart in any way like XLS did from XLT.\n\n==Fourth generation (U251; 2006\u20132010)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[United States]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo]], [[Venezuela]]\n| name = Fourth generation (U251)\n| image = 2006-2010 Ford Explorer -- 01-07-2012.jpg\n| production = July 2005\u2013December 16, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20101209/OEM01/101209818/ford-to-build-new-escape-in-kentucky-adding-1-800-jobs|title=Ford to build new Escape in Kentucky, adding 1,800 jobs|date=December 9, 2010|website=Automotive News}}</ref>\n| model_years = 2006\u20132010\n| body_style = 4-door [[SUV]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne SOHC]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine#3-valve|Modular 24-valve]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55S]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />6-speed ''[[Ford 6R transmission|6R]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|113.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|73.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 2006\u201307: {{Convert|71.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />2008: {{Convert|72.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2009\u201310: {{convert|71.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Ford Bronco#Official revival|Ford Bronco]] (2021)\n| related = [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#Second generation (2007\u20132010)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer#Third generation (2006\u20132010)|Mercury Mountaineer]]\n| designer = Jeff Nowak (2003)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = US Ford Explorer import (15288811352).jpg\n| caption1 = Ford Explorer\n| image2 = Ford Explorer XLT interior.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe ''Ford Explorer'' and the ''[[Mercury Mountaineer]]'' were both updated for the 2006 model year on a new frame, produced by ''[[Magna International]]'' rather than ''[[Tower Automotive]]''. Along with this new, stronger chassis, Ford updated the interior, redesigned the rear suspension and added power-folding third-row seats. Also, a [[tire pressure monitoring system]] and [[electronic stability control]] became standard equipment. Power [[running boards]], like the ones from the [[Lincoln Navigator]], were also made available on the Explorer and Mountaineer; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. Unlike previous generations, there was no [[right hand drive|right-hand drive]] option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in [[left hand drive|left-hand drive]] configuration. The LHD Explorers were desirable there because LHD vehicles are considered prestigious in Japan. Moreover, Ford switched to a one-piece rear liftgate design due to the problems associated with the previous generation's design.\n\nThe {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0L [[multi-valve|12-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-6 was once again the standard engine. A more powerful {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6L [[multi-valve|24-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-8, similar to the [[Fifth-generation Ford Mustang]]'s engine, was available as an option. The 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission|6R]] [[automatic transmission]], built by Ford and based on a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] design, was made standard equipment with the V-8 engine as well. The five-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] automatic transmission was advanced. It was the only transmission available for the V-6 engine, because the [[Mazda]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was dropped in the previous generation.\n\nThe 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award for 2006.\n\n===Model year changes===\nFor 2007, The Explorer received a few minor updates including standard AUX input on all stereos and optional power running boards,  heated windshield, Ironman Package, XLT Appearance Package, and heated leather seat package.\n\nFor 2008, Ford added side curtain airbags across the Explorer range. Also, the optional satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2008/review.html |title=2008 Ford Explorer Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received [[traffic]] flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2009/review.html |title=2009 Ford Explorer Review and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2010 model year, Ford's [[MyKey]] became standard on all Explorers equipped with the Sync system, while V8s were restricted to 4-wheel-drive models.\n\n===Engine specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Ford Cologne 4.0 L]]'' [[SOHC]] V-6\n|-\n| Model years || 2006\u20132010\n|-\n| Power (SAE net)|| {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n| Torque (SAE net)|| {{convert|254|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''[[Ford Modular]]'' 4.6 L [[SOHC]] V-8\n|-\n| Model years || 2006\u20132010\n|-\n| Power (SAE net)|| {{Convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n| Torque (SAE net)|| {{convert|315|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Ford Explorer Sport Trac===\n\nThe second generation '''[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Sport Trac]]''' came out in early 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]].

The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the [[I4 engine]]  to a 2.3 Liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 [[Ford Mustang]]. A newly introduced Platinum trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the [[Ford Escape]], an exclusive 500-watt [[Sony]] surround sound system, and a heated steering-wheel. The '''Platinum''' trim is paired with a 3.5 Liter EcoBoost [[Twin-turbo]] V6 with {{convert|365|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} which was previously only available with the '''Sport''' trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the Summer of 2015.

For the first generation, the three-door was available in any trim (except Limited), with Sport offered as a trim exclusive to the three-door.  Distinguished by black-colored wheelwells and rocker panels, Sport was slotted between XL and XLT.  For 1995, Expedition was offered as an trim package for the three-door Explorer; replacing the Eddie Bauer trim, the nameplate was retired after 1995 in preparation for the 1997 full-size four-door SUV.\n\nDuring the second generation, the XL and XLT trims were retired for the 1998 model year, with all three-door Explorers becoming Explorer Sports.  For 2001, the Explorer Sport was split from the four-door Explorer, retaining the second-generation body and chassis and adopting the front fascia of the Explorer Sport Trac.\n\nFord discontinued the Ford Explorer Sport following the 2003 model year, with the final vehicle produced in July 2003.<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Early 2-Door Explorer.JPG|1991-1994 Ford Explorer XL\nFile:1st-Ford-Explorer-Sport.jpg|1991-1994 Ford Explorer Sport\nFile:Ford Explorer Sport.jpg|1995-2000 Ford Explorer Sport\nFile:Ford Explorer Sport -- 03-11-2010.jpg|2001-2003 Ford Explorer Sport \n</gallery>\n\n=== Ford Explorer Sport Trac (2001-2010) ===\nIntroduced in 2000 as a 2001 model, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size pickup truck derived from the second-generation Explorer, becoming the first mid-size Ford pickup.  In contrast to the Ranger, the Sport Trac was marketed primarily as a personal-use vehicle rather than for work use.\n\nOffered solely as a four-door crew cab, the design of the Sport Trac shared commonality with multiple vehicles.  Sharing the frame and wheelbase of the Ranger SuperCab, the Sport Trac combined the front fascia of the Explorer Sport with a crew cab derived from the four-door Explorer; the pickup bed (designed for the model line) shared its tailgate with the F-150 SuperCrew.\n\nThe 2001-2005 Sport Trac was the final version of the Explorer derived from the Ranger.  After skipping the 2006 model year, a second-generation Sport Trac was produced from 2007 to 2010 (derived from the fourth-generation Explorer).<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1st Ford Explorer Sport Trac -- 03-21-2012.JPG|2000-2005 Ford Explorer Sport Trac\nFile:2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac rear.jpg|2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, rear\nFile:2nd Ford Sport Trac XLT.jpg|2007-2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac\n</gallery>\n\n===Ford Police Interceptor Utility===\n[[File:California Highway Patrol Ford Interceptor Utility (28137041810).jpg|alt=|thumb|Ford Police Interceptor Utility vehicle operated by the [[California Highway Patrol]].]]\n[[File:City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals Cars.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|2013-2015 Police Interceptor Utility (next to Police Interceptor Sedan); operated by City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals]]\nFollowing the end of production of the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] in 2011, Ford began development of a police-service variant of the Ford Explorer. For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Police Interceptor Utility; as with the related Police Interceptor Sedan variant of the Ford Taurus, the Utility is referred to as a Ford Police Interceptor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/hot-selling-ford-police-interceptor-utility-vehicle-now-offers-3|title=Ford Motor Company Official Global Corporate Homepage &#124; Ford.com|author=|date=March 13, 2017|website=Corporate.ford.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> in lieu of being a Ford Explorer.\n\nAs with the Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Expedition SSV, the Utility is not sold for retail sale and is specifically designed for use by law enforcement or use by other emergency service agencies.  Along with fleet-specific options such as steel wheels and provisions for user-specific paint schemes (such as contrasting doors), the Utility comes with provisions for fitting emergency equipment such as radios, [[lightbar]]s and sirens. To free up interior space on the center console for equipment, the transmission is fitted with a column-mounted shifter.\n\nThe Police Interceptor Utility comes with an all-wheel drive powertrain standard. Over a standard Explorer, the Utility is fitted with larger brake rotors, more advanced ABS and traction control systems, a more efficient cooling system and other standard police equipment.\n\nAt its launch, the initial engine fitted was a {{Convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.7 L version of the Ti-VCT V6, shared with the Ford Mustang and F-150. For 2014, Ford added the {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 (shared with the Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Taurus SHO).\n\nThe California Highway Patrol now uses the '''''Police Interceptor Utility''''' because the current Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car.<ref name=\"motortrend.com\" />  In May 2014, statisticians R.L.

Offered solely in a three-door configuration, only minor design details differed the Navajo from its Ford counterpart.  Along with significantly reducing the development costs of the model line for Mazda, the assembly of the Navajo by Ford in the United States allowed Mazda to circumvent the [[chicken tax]] (in contrast to intended Japanese-brand competitors [[Nissan Pathfinder]] and [[Toyota 4Runner]]).  \n\nAlong with a revised front fascia, the Navajo received new taillamps and wheels; the bumpers were painted dark gray (resulting in the deletion of all chrome trim).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/rare-anywhere-mazda-navajo|title=Rare anywhere: Mazda Navajo|date=2018-03-15|website=Autoweek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>  The interior was largely shared between the two model lines, with the Navajo receiving its own lettering for the instrument panel (in line with other Mazda vehicles); Mazda lettering was added to the Ford steering wheel hub.     \n\nIn place of the three trims offered on the three-door Ford Explorer, Mazda offered the Navajo in base DX and top-tier LX trim<ref name=\":2\" /> (roughly the equivalent of the Explorer Sport and three-door Explorer XLT).  Offered only with four-wheel drive at its launch, a rear-wheel drive version of the Navajo was introduced for 1992.  As with the first-generation Explorer, all Navajos were fitted with a 4.0L V6; a five-speed manual was standard, with a four-speed automatic offered as an option (on both the DX and LX<ref name=\":2\" />).  \n\nIn the early 1990s, SUVs transitioned into alternatives to station wagons, leading to a decline in demand for two-door SUVs.  After the 1994 model year, Mazda withdrew the Navajo, returning in 2000 with the four-door [[Mazda Tribute|Tribute]] (a counterpart of the [[Ford Escape]]).  \n\n=== Mercury Mountaineer (1997-2010) ===\n{{Main|Mercury Mountaineer}}\nThe Ford Explorer was sold by the Mercury division as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] from 1997 to 2010.  Developed as a competitor for the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] and the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)#Jeep Grand Wagoneer (1993)|1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer]], the Mountaineer was a four-door premium SUV slotted above the Explorer Limited.  Marking the reintroduction of the waterfall grille to the Mercury brand, the model line was distinguished by two-tone (and later monochromatic) styling different from the Explorer. \n\nCoinciding with the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand, the Mountaineer was withdrawn after the 2010 model year; three generations were produced, with the Mountaineer serving as the largest Mercury SUV (above the [[Mercury Mariner|Mariner]]).<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1998-2001 Mercury Mountaineer.jpg|1998-2001 Mercury Mountaineer\nFile:Mercury Mountaineer.jpg|2002-2005 Mercury Mountaineer \nFile:3rd Mercury Mountaineer -- 03-05-2010.jpg|2006-2010 Mercury Mountaineer \n</gallery>\n\n=== Lincoln Aviator ===\n[[File:2003-Aviator-weiss-1.JPG|thumb|2003 Lincoln Aviator]]\n[[File:2019 Lincoln Aviator prototype 01.jpg|thumb|2020-present Lincoln Aviator]]{{Main|Lincoln Aviator}}\nThe Ford Explorer has been sold twice by the Lincoln division as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].  From 2003 to 2005, the Lincoln Aviator was marketed as a counterpart of the third-generation Explorer.  The first mid-size SUV sold by Lincoln, the model line was slotted between the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.  Following the introduction of the fourth-generation Explorer, the model line was repackaged as a CUV based on the [[Ford Edge]] and renamed the [[Lincoln MKX]] (today the Lincoln Nautilus).\n\nFor 2020, the Lincoln Aviator was revived (after a 14-year hiatus) as a mid-size SUV; as before, the model line is a Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Explorer (now the sixth generation) and the Lincoln Navigator.  The second-generation Aviator is the first Lincoln vehicle offered as with [[plug-in hybrid]] capability as an option; its 494 hp combined output is the highest-ever for a Lincoln vehicle.\n\n== Export sales ==\n\n===UK models===\nIn the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification \u2013 the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black.\n\n===Middle East and Asia===\nIn the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer is currently available in several trims, all of which have a 3.5-liter V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drivearabia.com/news/2011/08/24/ford-explorer-2011-2012-gcc-specifications-dubai-uae-gcc/|title=Ford Explorer 2011-2012 full GCC spec-sheets|website=Drive Arabia}}</ref> The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ford.co.jp/|title=Ford Japan|work=ford.co.jp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001082041/https://www.ford.co.jp/|archivedate=October 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Current exports===\nAs of 2009, the Explorer is also sold in Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Iceland, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.\n\nAs of 2014, the Explorer is also available in Ukraine and Belarus.

Both companies' reputations were tarnished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/autosafety/article_redirect.cfm?ID=5413|title=Public Citizen Auto Safety|work=citizen.org}}</ref> This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.\n\nRollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/> The previous Bronco II had already been cited by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' for rollover tendencies in turns.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/>\n\nThe Explorer was cleared by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely. It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a9399/why-blowouts-happen-and-how-to-avoid-them-15832078/|title=Why Blowouts Happen\u2014and How to Avoid Them|author=Mac Demere|work=Popular Mechanics}}</ref> A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer's center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.\n\nExplorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control on many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle .<ref>{{cite web|author=Pat McCarty |url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com |title=Ford Explorer Rollover |publisher=Ford Explorer Rollover |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2000, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted Ford and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about a higher than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[#Mazda Navajo (1991-1994)|Mazda Navajo]]s fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved ''tread separation'', in which the outer tread carcass would [[delamination|delaminate]] and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant.\n\nFord recommended a tire inflation of only {{convert|26|psi|0}} likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/>\n\nFord argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to {{convert|30|psi|0}} on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.\n\nSome have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowout was a contributing factor.<ref name=\"Wards\">\"Bad Drivers, Good Credibility \u2013 car makers face uphill struggle against public perception\", ''Ward's Auto World'', April 2001</ref> When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle's weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for ''[[Car and Driver|Car & Driver]]'' magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Wards\"/><ref>[[Doron Levin]] column, ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', October 27, 2000</ref> According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths were caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two.<ref>Dan Ackman, \"Ford, Firestone Face Off\", ''[[Forbes]]'', June 19, 2001</ref> Many vehicle injury attorneys dissent from this view.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psblaw.com/2010/08/31/tire-separation-causes-california-auto-accident-involving-police-officer/|title=Tire Separation Causes California Auto Accident Involving Police Officer|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2010|website=Panish, Shea & Boyle LLP|publisher=Panish, Shea & Boyle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tire Tread Separation - 2 Theories of Liability.doc |website=Cdrb-law.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328225419/https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Firestone's allegations of the Explorer's design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required.

When the engine is run for an extended period of time with this issue, the engine can jump timing or cease from running, damaging the heads and valves.\n\nTiming chain rattle was mitigated in later years of the SOHC (in most vehicles, after 2002) with updated cassettes and tensioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.underhoodservice.com/exploring-service-needs-on-the-ford-4-0l-v6-engine/|date=Apr 15, 2013|title=\u2018Exploring\u2019 Service Needs On The Ford 4.0L V6 Engine|first=Larry |last=Carley|website=Underhood Service|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 5R55 series transmissions found on second through fourth generation Explorers was also notorious for premature failures.

Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, the Explorer was the first four-door SUV produced by Ford, replacing the two-door [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]. Six generations of the Explorer have been produced. The sixth generation  was unveiled in January 2019. As with the [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]], the Explorer derives its name from a trim package used on the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]], used from 1967 to 1986. Originally slotted below the full-size [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]] in the Ford truck line, the current Explorer is slotted between the [[Ford Edge|Edge]] and standard-wheelbase [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]].\n\nFor its first two generations, the Explorer was produced in both two-door (as the ''Explorer Sport'') and four-door configurations. Upon the introduction of the third generation, the Explorer was produced exclusively as a four-door SUV; the Explorer Sport was discontinued in 2003. The Sport name was resurrected in 2011 for the 2012 year model, but as a performance version of the standard four-door Explorer. The Explorer has been offered with a number of powertrain layouts during its production. The first four generations offered rear-wheel drive as standard, with part-time four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options; the fifth generation offered front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, while the sixth generation reverted to rear-wheel drive with optional all-wheel drive.\n\nDuring its production, numerous variants of the Explorer have been marketed, with Lincoln-Mercury selling the four-door Explorer as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] (1996\u20132010) and the [[Lincoln Aviator]] (2002\u20132005; 2019\u2013); Mazda sold the Explorer Sport as the Mazda Navajo (1990\u20131994). The [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size [[pickup truck]] derived from the four-door Explorer; two generations were produced from 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/fmc/ford-motor-company-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-usa-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-louisville-assembly-plant-louisville-kentucky-usa/ |title=Ford Louisville |work=Fordauthority.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> to 2010. For police use, Ford developed the '''Ford Police Interceptor Utility''' from the fifth-generation Explorer (replacing the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]); a specially modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is also available from Ford Fleet for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]].\n\n==First generation (1991\u20131994)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (UN46)\n| aka = [[#Mazda Navajo (1991-1994)|Mazda Navajo]]\n| image = '91-'94 Ford Explorer.jpg\n| caption = First-generation Ford Explorer\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, United States ([[Louisville Assembly Plant]])<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri, United States ([[St. Louis Assembly]])<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], Venezuela ([[Valencia Assembly]])\n| production = February 1990 \u2013 November 1994<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/24/news/mn-9479|title=Documents Show Ford's Concerns Over Explorer|work=latimes|date=August 24, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com/history/default.cfm |title=Ford Explorer Rollover History Tire Recall Chronology |publisher=Willis Law Firm |accessdate=September 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919074742/http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com/history/Default.cfm |archivedate=September 19, 2015  }}</ref>\n| model_years = 1991\u20131994\n| body_style = 3-door [[SUV]]<br />5-door [[SUV]]\n| engine = 4.0 L OHV ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]\n| transmission = 5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = 3-Door: {{Convert|102.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|111.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 3-Door: {{Convert|174.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|184.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|70.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 3-Door: {{Convert|67.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />5-Door: {{Convert|67.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Eddie Bauer: {{Convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Mazda Navajo]]<br />[[Ford Ranger (North America)#First generation|Ford Ranger]]<br />[[Ford Bronco II]]\n}}\n[[File:1994 Ford Explorer Sport rear 7.28.18.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Ford Explorer Sport rear]]\n[[File:1992 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer (6005113836).jpg|left|thumb|1992 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer]]\n[[File:1993 Explorer Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nThe Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 for the 1991 model year.  To better compete against the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] mid-size sport-utility vehicles, Ford sought to replace the Ford Bronco II with a vehicle sized closer to its competitors. In an effort to attract family buyers, a four-door version was developed alongside the two-door (launched the same month as the four-door S-10 Blazer).\n\nAs with the Ford Bronco II, the first-generation Ford Explorer shares its chassis and underpinnings with the first-generation (1983-1992) Ford Ranger. In comparison to the Bronco II, the Explorer is far larger, with the two-door Explorer Sport gaining 12.6 inches in length and 2.1 inches of width; a four-door is {{Convert|22.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer and {{Convert|730|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the Ford Explorer has a large degree of commonality with the Ford Ranger, sharing its front bumper, fenders (modified), headlights, grille, and wheels; with the exception of its steering wheel hub, the Explorer shares its entire dashboard with the 1989-1992 Ford Ranger. In a major change from the Bronco II, the Explorer was given its own front door stampings. In addition for creating a four-door layout, the lack of commonality with the Ranger allowed for two major aerodynamic improvements; along with the elimination of exterior drip rails (by wrapping the doors into the roof), the sideview mirrors were integrated onto the doors (rather than bolted on).\n\n=== Chassis ===\nSharing its engine with the Ranger and four-wheel drive Ford Aerostar, the Explorer was fitted with a German-produced {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne'']] V6 as the sole engine offering, replacing the previous 2.9 L V6.  A Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]] overdrive automatic transmission. For 1993, the engine output was increased to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlong with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with various configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, powered by a [[Borg Warner]] 13\u201354 transfer case.  In addition to a manually shifted transfer case, Ford offered \"Touch Drive\" electronic push-button shifting; both were \"shift-on-the-fly\" designs that allowed the vehicle to be shifted from [[two-wheel drive]] to \"four-high\" at any speed and into \"four-low\" when the vehicle was stopped.  All Explorers were equipped with the [[Ford 8.8 axle]] in either a limited slip differential, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB (\"[[Twin Traction Beam]]\") [[Dana 35]] with some [[Dana 44|Dana 44-spec]] components.\n\n=== Trim ===\nAt its launch, the Ford Explorer followed the Aerostar, Bronco, Econoline, F-Series, and Ranger in model trim. The XL was sold as the base trim, with XLT as the upper range, with the outdoors-themed [[Eddie Bauer]] trim as the top trim.  The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Sport was offered solely on the two-door body style.  Offering black lower bodywork and grille and alloy wheels, the Sport was intended as a replacement for the Bronco II.  From 1990 to 1994,<ref>{{cite book|title=Snow Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iA3VKGz_rOoC&pg=RA1-PA84|date=October 1990|page=84|issn=0896-758X}}</ref> Mazda marketed the two-door Ford Explorer as the Mazda Navajo; the model was awarded the 1991 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' [[Truck of the Year]] award.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Limited was introduced for 1993 as a luxury-trim model slotted above the Eddie Bauer. Largely introduced as a competitor to the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], the Explorer Limited was offered only as a four-door with an automatic transmission. Distinguished by its color-matched grille, headlight trim, and model-specific bodywork and wheels, the Limited was offered with several model-specific features, including automatic headlights, an [[Automatic Dimming Mirror|auto-dimming rearview mirror]], [[foglamps]], and center roof console (with compass and outside thermometer).\n\n==Second generation (1995\u20132001)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation (UN105/UN150)\n|image = 1998 Ford Explorer XLT 4.0L, front 11.22.19.jpg\n|aka = Ford Explorer Sport (3-door)\n|production  = November 1994 \u2013 December 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA146EA867E34&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLES : Enduring style or 'flash in pan'? |website=Nl.newsbank.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref><br />November 1994\u2013July 2003 for Sport\n|model_years = 1995\u20132001 (5-door)<br />1995\u20132003 (3-door)\n|assembly    = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, United States ([[Louisville Assembly Plant]])<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri, United States<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], Venezuela ([[Valencia Assembly]])\n|related     = [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#First generation (2001\u20132005)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer]]\n|body_style  = 3-door [[SUV]] (1995\u20132003)<br />5-door [[SUV]] (1995\u20132001)\n|layout      = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n|engine      = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' [[OHV]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (1995\u20132000)<br />4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne]]'' [[SOHC]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (1997\u20132003)<br />5.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford 302 engine|Windsor]]'' [[OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] (1996\u20132001)\n|transmission = 5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1|M5OD-R1]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]] (4.0 L OHV)<br />5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1HD|M5OD-R1HD]]'' (2001\u20132003 Explorer Sport)<br />4-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#4R55E|4R55E]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (4.0 L 1995\u20131996)<br />4-speed ''[[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (V-8 models)<br />5-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55E]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (4.0 L 1997\u20132001) \n|wheelbase = 1995\u201397 5-door: {{Convert|111.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u20132001 5-door: {{Convert|111.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995\u201399 3-door: {{Convert|101.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2000\u201303 3-door: {{Convert|101.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1995\u20132001 5-door: {{Convert|190.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />1995\u201397 3-door: {{Convert|178.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u201399 3-door: {{Convert|180.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2000\u201303 3-door: {{Convert|180.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{Convert|70.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{Convert|67.0|-|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer = Bob Aikins (1992)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1996 Ford Explorer XLT V6 (6310574836) (cropped).jpg\n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Ford Explorer XLT (Europe)\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition - 16312869163.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe second-generation Ford Explorer made its debut in late 1994 as a 1995 model.  Retaining the same footprint as its predecessor, the 1995 Ford Explorer underwent extensive modifications to its chassis to improve its road manners.  In an effort to better differentiate the model line from the Ford Ranger, Ford stylists redesigned the vehicle, giving the Explorer a model-specific exterior.  As with its predecessor, the second generation was sold in both three-door and five-door configurations.  Rear-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive offered as an option.\n\nFollowing the January 2001 introduction of the third-generation five-door Ford Explorer, the three-door Explorer became a stand-alone model on the second-generation design; the Explorer Sport was produced through the 2003 model year.\n\nThis generation of the Ford Explorer marks the debut of the 1997 [[Mercury Mountaineer]], introduced in 1996 by Mercury.  In early 2000, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] was introduced, which was a mid-size pickup truck; offered with a crew cab with a short pickup bed, the Sport Trac was based on the five-door Explorer.  The Explorer Sport Trac was produced through the 2005 model year (until it was redesigned for 2007).\n\nOutside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs.

Alongside similar changes in development for the [[Ford Ranger (North America)#Third generation (1998\u20132012)|1998 Ford Ranger]], the long-running [[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]/[[Twin Traction Beam]] front suspension was retired in favor of a [[Double wishbone suspension#Short long arms suspension|short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone]] front suspension configuration.  Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components, the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nThe optional engine of the Ford Ranger and Ford Aerostar, the 160&nbsp;hp 4.0 L V6 was carried over from the first-generation Ford Explorer. To match the V8 engine of the similar-sized [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]], for the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a 5.0 L V8 as an option. Initially available on rear-wheel drive XLT models, the availability of the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 was expanded to many versions of the five-door Explorer, and came standard with all-wheel-drive starting in 1997.  For 1997, revised cylinder heads increased output of the 5.0 L V8 to {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Following the January 1996 introduction of the 4.6 L SOHC V8 by the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]] and [[Ford E-Series|E-Series]], the Explorer became the final vehicle sold by Ford Motor Company sold with a gasoline pushrod V8.\n\nFor 1997, the Ford Explorer gained a third engine, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0 L Cologne V6.  Using a common displacement with the pushrod 4.0 L V6, the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC V6 rivaled the V8 in engine output.  Offered as standard equipment on the top-trim Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, the engine became an option on all other versions of the Explorer and Explorer Sport. For 2001, the pushrod V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC becoming the standard engine in all versions of the Explorer (and the sole engine of the 3-door Explorer Sport).\n\nFor 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Engine\n!Production\n!Configuration\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n!Transfer Case\n\n|-\n|Ford [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne V6'']]\n|1995-2000\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV 12V V6\n|{{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed manual (Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|''M5OD-R1'']])\n4-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#4R44E/4R55E|''4R55E'']]); 1995-1996\n\n5-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|''5R55E'']]); 1997-2000\n|Borg Warner 44-05 Electric Shift ''Control Trac''\n\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne V6]]''\n|1997-2003\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 12V V6\n|{{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|254|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed manual (Mazda ''M5OD-R1HD''); 2001-2003 Explorer Sport\n5-speed automatic (Ford ''5R55E'') \n|Borg Warner 44-05 Electric Shift ''Control Trac''; 1997-2001\nBorg Warner 13-54 Electric Shift; 2001-2003 Explorer Sport\n\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford windsor engine#302|Windsor 5.0 L V8]]'' \n|1996-2001\n|{{Convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV 16V V8\n|{{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{Convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|4-speed automatic (Ford [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]])\n|Borg Warner 44-04 Full-Time AWD\n|}\nA Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with OHV V6 engine. The SOHC did not receive the 5-speed until 2000, but it was a stronger unit than the one behind the OHV. All V8 examples were equipped with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Mustang, and Crown Victoria). \n\nThe four-wheel drive system was redesigned for the 1995 Explorer. \nFor the V6 models, in place of Touch Drive from the previous generation, [[ControlTrac]] was an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, with software controlling a multi-disc clutch (in place of a center differential). Along with traditional two-wheel drive and high and low-range four-wheel drive, \"Auto\" mode allowed software to maintain the amount of torque sent to the front wheels; if the front axle begins to spin slower, torque is shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved. Similar to TouchDrive, ControlTrac is dash-controlled, with a rotary selector for two-wheel drive (1995-1996, 2001-2003 Sports), auto (1997-2001), high range, and low range. \n\nThe V8 models came equipped with a different full-time AWD system, without the 4x4 High-Range/Low-Range feature. The system required no driver input and torque distribution was entirely managed by a viscous clutch with a 40/60 split.\n\n=== Body ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1999-01 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer.jpg\n| image2 = Ford Explorer (2).jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Ford Explorer\n}}\nWhile visibly similar to its predecessor, many exterior panels from the 1995 Ford Explorer were changed, with only the roofline and the side doors carrying over.  As part of the changes related to the redesigned front suspension, the entire front fascia was redesigned, with the Explorer gaining model-distinct styling.  In a styling theme that would be used in several other Ford small trucks, the 1995 Explorer was given an oval grille; the headlamps were changed from rectangular to oval as well, wrapping into the fenders.  Depending on trim, the grille and bumpers were painted gray (XLT), body color (Limited/Sport), or chromed.  In contrast to the front fascia, the rear fascia saw relatively few changes, with the rear bumper nearly unchanged.  Along with slightly reshaped taillamps (with amber turn signals), the 1995 Ford Explorer marked the debut of a neon CHMSL (center brake light).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1084360/Ford-Explorer.html|title=1995 Explorer first production vehicle to use a neon stop lamp|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the redesigned exterior, the interior of the second-generation Ford Explorer was given a redesign.  Maintaining commonality with the Ranger, the Explorer was given a new dashboard (marking the debut of dual airbags in an American-produced SUV), a new instrument panel; to improve user ergonomics, the Ford Explorer introduced a double-DIN radio panel and rotary-style climate controls.\n\nFor 1997, a third-row seat was introduced as an option; expanding seating to seven passengers, the design was only offered in export markets.\n\nFor 1998, the exterior of the Ford Explorer was given a mid-cycle update.  Distinguished by the addition of fender flares, the rear fascia was restyled, with larger taillamps; to better accommodate export, the license plate was shifted from the bumper to the liftgate; the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version.  16-inch wheels replaced 15-inch wheels (shared with the Ranger).  For 1999, the front bumper was redesigned, allowing for larger lower grille and fog lights.\n\nThe interior was given redesigned front and rear seats, along with second-generation airbags; side airbags were introduced (as an option).  Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system.\n\n=== Trim ===\nAt its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade.  Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited.  For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999).\n\nIn contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature.  While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level.  In 1995, the Expedition trim was introduced; roughly the 3-door equivalent of the Eddie Bauer, the trim was discontinued at the end of the model year as Ford reserved the name for the [[Ford Expedition]] full-size SUV (which entered production in mid-1996).\n\nFor 1998, the Explorer Sport became the sole version of the three-door; following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Explorer Sport became a distinct model through the 2003 model year.\n{{-}}\n\n==Third generation (U152; 2002\u20132005)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation (U152)\n|layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]] / [[all-wheel drive]]\n|assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[United States]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo]], [[Venezuela]]\n|image = 2002-2005_Ford_Explorer_--_06-16-2011.jpg\n|production = November 2000\u2013June 2005\n|model_years = 2002\u20132005\n|body_style = 4-door [[SUV]]\n|engine = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne]]'' [[V6]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine#2-valve|16-valve Modular]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 5-speed [[Mazda M5OD transmission#M5OD-R1HD|M5OD-R1HD]] [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />5-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55S]] automatic\n|wheelbase = 2002\u201303: {{Convert|113.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />2004\u201305: {{Convert|113.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{Convert|189.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{Convert|72.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{Convert|71.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related =[[#Explorer Sport variation|Ford Explorer Sport]]<br />[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#First generation (2001\u20132005)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Lincoln Aviator]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer#Second generation (2002\u20132005)|Mercury Mountaineer]]\n| designer = Edward Golden (1997)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Truby|first1=Mark |title=Ford Refines 2002 Explorer |department=Explorer Forum|newspaper=[[The Detroit News]] |date=August 4, 2000}}{{vn|date=September 2019|reason=Never was a valid URL}}</ref>\n}}The third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 (as an early 2002 model). The U152 program began in 1995, with the final design being chosen in 1997 and frozen for production in February 1998, with development ending in 2000. The primary objective behind the third-generation Ford Explorer was to make the vehicle line more competitive in both domestic and export markets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20010326/ANE/103260845#axzz2hlp6op7Q|title=Ford Explorer project leader aimed at a global standard|work=Automotive News|date=March 26, 2001}}</ref>  Along with tuning the Explorer for higher-speed European driving, the Explorer was benchmarked to lead against the [[Lexus RX]]300 and the then-in-development [[Volkswagen Touareg]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:2002 Ford Explorer (UT) XLT wagon (2015-06-25) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Explorer XLT (Australia)]]\nTo make the Explorer more competitive, Ford shifted away from typical SUV design, abandoning the use of the Ford Ranger chassis architecture in favor of designing a purpose-built platform.  As part of the change, the Explorer became only the second rear-wheel drive American Ford platform fitted with four-wheel independent suspension (behind the MN12 platform).  In another major change, the third-generation Explorer was developed solely as a five-door vehicle. Retaining the previous-generation chassis architecture, the three-door Explorer Sport continued production through the 2003 model year; the Explorer Sport Trac four-door pickup truck continued through 2005.\n\nThe third-generation Ford Explorer was marketed by all three divisions of Ford Motor Company: by Mercury as the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln marketed the third-generation Explorer from 2002 to 2005 as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe third-generation is based on the body-on-frame [[Ford U platform#U1|Ford UN152 platform]].  No longer derived from the Ford Ranger, the UN152 chassis was designed specifically for the five-door Explorer and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts.  In a major shift from its predecessors, the third-generation Explorer adopted a four-wheel [[independent suspension]] configuration, never before used on a Ford truck (on American-produced SUVs, fully independent suspension was previously exclusive to the [[Hummer H1]]).  Similar to the layout used on the Ford MN12-chassis cars (1989-1998 Thunderbird/Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII), each rear wheel was connected to the rear-axle differential with two half-shafts.\n\nWhile the third-generation Ford Explorer was in development during the late 1990s a controversy involving the [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy|Explorer and Firestone tires]] developed, thus the increased stability of the configuration was designed in part to reduce rollover risk.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/business/explorer-model-raises-doubts-about-safety.html?p=&pagewanted=all|title=Explorer Model Raises Doubts About Safety|author=Bradsher, Keith|date=April 26, 2001|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"autosafety.org\" />  In another change, Firestone tires (which had caused the rollovers and crashes of the Ford Explorers)  were not made available on any version of the third-generation Explorer.  Ford's AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control) system became available as a standard feature on the Explorer for the 2005 model year.\n\nAlong with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive; the latter was offered on the Explorer for the first time.\n\nCarried over from the previous generation, the base engine for the third-generation Explorer was a {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L V6.  Becoming the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt to the [[Ford Modular engine|Modular V8]], the third-generation Explorer offered a {{convert|239|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6 L SOHC V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis) as its optional engine.  A five-speed manual transmission was offered for 2002 before its discontinuation; as of the 2020 model year, it is the final year a Ford Explorer was available with a manual transmission.  As an option for both the 4.0L and 4.6L V8 engines, the Ford 5R55 transmission was offered, becoming standard from 2003 to 2005.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Engine\n!Production\n!Configuration\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne V6]]''\n|2002-2005\n|{{Convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 12V V6\n|{{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} \n|{{convert|254|lbft|Nm||abbr=on}}\n|Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|''M5OD-R1HD'']] 5-speed manual (2002 only)\nFord 5R55 5-speed automatic\n|-\n|Ford [[Ford Modular engine#4.6 L|''Modular V8'']]\n|2002-2005\n|{{Convert|281|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} SOHC 16V V8\n|{{convert|238|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4750 rpm\n|{{convert|282|lbft|Nm||abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm\n|Ford [[Ford C3 transmission#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55]] 5-speed automatic\n|}\n\n=== Body ===\nIn contrast with the second-generation (a major revision of the 1991-1994 generation), the exterior and interior of the third-generation Ford Explorer were completely new designs. While sharing a number of design elements with the 1997 F-Series and Ford Expedition, the Ford Explorer also served as the introduction of a new design theme for several Ford vehicles; the 2003 Ford Expedition, the Ford Freestar, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred would share various elements of the 2002 Ford Explorer design.  Retaining nearly the same proportions as the first two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter in length and two inches wider, gaining two inches in wheelbase.\n\nWith the addition of independent rear suspension, several functional changes were brought as part of the redesign.  The cargo floor was lowered several inches, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of total cargo room.  Coinciding with the lower cargo floor, on nearly all models, a folding third-row seat was either standard or an option, bringing seating capacity to seven.  The rear liftgate was redesigned, with the upper hatch enlarged.\n\n=== Trim ===\nFord produced the third generation Explorer in five trim levels: XLS, XLT, NBX, Eddie Bauer, and Limited.  Slotted below the XLS were two major trim packages, Sport Value, Sport Choice, with Sport Premium between XLS and XLT.  The outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer continued production with a two-tone exterior (with a tan lower body); the Limited wore a monochromatic body. The NBX trim was only made for 2003 and 2004, and was a loaded up XLT with Eddie Bauer-esque features. It was more like a bang-for-your-buck Eddie Bauer model rather than an actual trim level, as it didn't really set itself apart in any way like XLS did from XLT.\n\n==Fourth generation (U251; 2006\u20132010)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| assembly = [[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]<br />[[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[United States]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo]], [[Venezuela]]\n| name = Fourth generation (U251)\n| image = 2006-2010 Ford Explorer -- 01-07-2012.jpg\n| production = July 2005\u2013December 16, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20101209/OEM01/101209818/ford-to-build-new-escape-in-kentucky-adding-1-800-jobs|title=Ford to build new Escape in Kentucky, adding 1,800 jobs|date=December 9, 2010|website=Automotive News}}</ref>\n| model_years = 2006\u20132010\n| body_style = 4-door [[SUV]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Cologne SOHC]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine#3-valve|Modular 24-valve]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55S]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />6-speed ''[[Ford 6R transmission|6R]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|113.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|73.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 2006\u201307: {{Convert|71.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br />2008: {{Convert|72.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />2009\u201310: {{convert|71.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Ford Bronco#Official revival|Ford Bronco]] (2021)\n| related = [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac#Second generation (2007\u20132010)|Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]<br />[[Mercury Mountaineer#Third generation (2006\u20132010)|Mercury Mountaineer]]\n| designer = Jeff Nowak (2003)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = US Ford Explorer import (15288811352).jpg\n| caption1 = Ford Explorer\n| image2 = Ford Explorer XLT interior.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe ''Ford Explorer'' and the ''[[Mercury Mountaineer]]'' were both updated for the 2006 model year on a new frame, produced by ''[[Magna International]]'' rather than ''[[Tower Automotive]]''. Along with this new, stronger chassis, Ford updated the interior, redesigned the rear suspension and added power-folding third-row seats. Also, a [[tire pressure monitoring system]] and [[electronic stability control]] became standard equipment. Power [[running boards]], like the ones from the [[Lincoln Navigator]], were also made available on the Explorer and Mountaineer; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. Unlike previous generations, there was no [[right hand drive|right-hand drive]] option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in [[left hand drive|left-hand drive]] configuration. The LHD Explorers were desirable there because LHD vehicles are considered prestigious in Japan. Moreover, Ford switched to a one-piece rear liftgate design due to the problems associated with the previous generation's design.\n\nThe {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0L [[multi-valve|12-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-6 was once again the standard engine. A more powerful {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6L [[multi-valve|24-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-8, similar to the [[Fifth-generation Ford Mustang]]'s engine, was available as an option. The 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission|6R]] [[automatic transmission]], built by Ford and based on a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] design, was made standard equipment with the V-8 engine as well. The five-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] automatic transmission was advanced. It was the only transmission available for the V-6 engine, because the [[Mazda]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was dropped in the previous generation.\n\nThe 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award for 2006.\n\n===Model year changes===\nFor 2007, The Explorer received a few minor updates including standard AUX input on all stereos and optional power running boards,  heated windshield, Ironman Package, XLT Appearance Package, and heated leather seat package.\n\nFor 2008, Ford added side curtain airbags across the Explorer range. Also, the optional satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2008/review.html |title=2008 Ford Explorer Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received [[traffic]] flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2009/review.html |title=2009 Ford Explorer Review and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2010 model year, Ford's [[MyKey]] became standard on all Explorers equipped with the Sync system, while V8s were restricted to 4-wheel-drive models.\n\n===Engine specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Ford Cologne 4.0 L]]'' [[SOHC]] V-6\n|-\n| Model years || 2006\u20132010\n|-\n| Power (SAE net)|| {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n| Torque (SAE net)|| {{convert|254|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''[[Ford Modular]]'' 4.6 L [[SOHC]] V-8\n|-\n| Model years || 2006\u20132010\n|-\n| Power (SAE net)|| {{Convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n| Torque (SAE net)|| {{convert|315|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Ford Explorer Sport Trac===\n\nThe second generation '''[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Sport Trac]]''' came out in early 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]].

The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the [[I4 engine]]  to a 2.3 Liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 [[Ford Mustang]]. A newly introduced Platinum trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the [[Ford Escape]], an exclusive 500-watt [[Sony]] surround sound system, and a heated steering-wheel. The '''Platinum''' trim is paired with a 3.5 Liter EcoBoost [[Twin-turbo]] V6 with {{convert|365|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} which was previously only available with the '''Sport''' trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the Summer of 2015.

For the first generation, the three-door was available in any trim (except Limited), with Sport offered as a trim exclusive to the three-door.  Distinguished by black-colored wheelwells and rocker panels, Sport was slotted between XL and XLT.  For 1995, Expedition was offered as an trim package for the three-door Explorer; replacing the Eddie Bauer trim, the nameplate was retired after 1995 in preparation for the 1997 full-size four-door SUV.\n\nDuring the second generation, the XL and XLT trims were retired for the 1998 model year, with all three-door Explorers becoming Explorer Sports.  For 2001, the Explorer Sport was split from the four-door Explorer, retaining the second-generation body and chassis and adopting the front fascia of the Explorer Sport Trac.\n\nFord discontinued the Ford Explorer Sport following the 2003 model year, with the final vehicle produced in July 2003.<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Early 2-Door Explorer.JPG|1991-1994 Ford Explorer XL\nFile:1st-Ford-Explorer-Sport.jpg|1991-1994 Ford Explorer Sport\nFile:Ford Explorer Sport.jpg|1995-2000 Ford Explorer Sport\nFile:Ford Explorer Sport -- 03-11-2010.jpg|2001-2003 Ford Explorer Sport \n</gallery>\n\n=== Ford Explorer Sport Trac (2001-2010) ===\nIntroduced in 2000 as a 2001 model, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size pickup truck derived from the second-generation Explorer, becoming the first mid-size Ford pickup.  In contrast to the Ranger, the Sport Trac was marketed primarily as a personal-use vehicle rather than for work use.\n\nOffered solely as a four-door crew cab, the design of the Sport Trac shared commonality with multiple vehicles.  Sharing the frame and wheelbase of the Ranger SuperCab, the Sport Trac combined the front fascia of the Explorer Sport with a crew cab derived from the four-door Explorer; the pickup bed (designed for the model line) shared its tailgate with the F-150 SuperCrew.\n\nThe 2001-2005 Sport Trac was the final version of the Explorer derived from the Ranger.  After skipping the 2006 model year, a second-generation Sport Trac was produced from 2007 to 2010 (derived from the fourth-generation Explorer).<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1st Ford Explorer Sport Trac -- 03-21-2012.JPG|2000-2005 Ford Explorer Sport Trac\nFile:2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac rear.jpg|2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, rear\nFile:2nd Ford Sport Trac XLT.jpg|2007-2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac\n</gallery>\n\n===Ford Police Interceptor Utility===\n[[File:California Highway Patrol Ford Interceptor Utility (28137041810).jpg|alt=|thumb|Ford Police Interceptor Utility vehicle operated by the [[California Highway Patrol]].]]\n[[File:City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals Cars.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|2013-2015 Police Interceptor Utility (next to Police Interceptor Sedan); operated by City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals]]\nFollowing the end of production of the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] in 2011, Ford began development of a police-service variant of the Ford Explorer. For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Police Interceptor Utility; as with the related Police Interceptor Sedan variant of the Ford Taurus, the Utility is referred to as a Ford Police Interceptor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/hot-selling-ford-police-interceptor-utility-vehicle-now-offers-3|title=Ford Motor Company Official Global Corporate Homepage &#124; Ford.com|author=|date=March 13, 2017|website=Corporate.ford.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> in lieu of being a Ford Explorer.\n\nAs with the Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Expedition SSV, the Utility is not sold for retail sale and is specifically designed for use by law enforcement or use by other emergency service agencies.  Along with fleet-specific options such as steel wheels and provisions for user-specific paint schemes (such as contrasting doors), the Utility comes with provisions for fitting emergency equipment such as radios, [[lightbar]]s and sirens. To free up interior space on the center console for equipment, the transmission is fitted with a column-mounted shifter.\n\nThe Police Interceptor Utility comes with an all-wheel drive powertrain standard. Over a standard Explorer, the Utility is fitted with larger brake rotors, more advanced ABS and traction control systems, a more efficient cooling system and other standard police equipment.\n\nAt its launch, the initial engine fitted was a {{Convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.7 L version of the Ti-VCT V6, shared with the Ford Mustang and F-150. For 2014, Ford added the {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 (shared with the Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Taurus SHO).\n\nThe California Highway Patrol now uses the '''''Police Interceptor Utility''''' because the current Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car.<ref name=\"motortrend.com\" />  In May 2014, statisticians R.L.

Offered solely in a three-door configuration, only minor design details differed the Navajo from its Ford counterpart.  Along with significantly reducing the development costs of the model line for Mazda, the assembly of the Navajo by Ford in the United States allowed Mazda to circumvent the [[chicken tax]] (in contrast to intended Japanese-brand competitors [[Nissan Pathfinder]] and [[Toyota 4Runner]]).  \n\nAlong with a revised front fascia, the Navajo received new taillamps and wheels; the bumpers were painted dark gray (resulting in the deletion of all chrome trim).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/rare-anywhere-mazda-navajo|title=Rare anywhere: Mazda Navajo|date=2018-03-15|website=Autoweek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>  The interior was largely shared between the two model lines, with the Navajo receiving its own lettering for the instrument panel (in line with other Mazda vehicles); Mazda lettering was added to the Ford steering wheel hub.     \n\nIn place of the three trims offered on the three-door Ford Explorer, Mazda offered the Navajo in base DX and top-tier LX trim<ref name=\":2\" /> (roughly the equivalent of the Explorer Sport and three-door Explorer XLT).  Offered only with four-wheel drive at its launch, a rear-wheel drive version of the Navajo was introduced for 1992.  As with the first-generation Explorer, all Navajos were fitted with a 4.0L V6; a five-speed manual was standard, with a four-speed automatic offered as an option (on both the DX and LX<ref name=\":2\" />).  \n\nIn the early 1990s, SUVs transitioned into alternatives to station wagons, leading to a decline in demand for two-door SUVs.  After the 1994 model year, Mazda withdrew the Navajo, returning in 2000 with the four-door [[Mazda Tribute|Tribute]] (a counterpart of the [[Ford Escape]]).  \n\n=== Mercury Mountaineer (1997-2010) ===\n{{Main|Mercury Mountaineer}}\nThe Ford Explorer was sold by the Mercury division as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] from 1997 to 2010.  Developed as a competitor for the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] and the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)#Jeep Grand Wagoneer (1993)|1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer]], the Mountaineer was a four-door premium SUV slotted above the Explorer Limited.  Marking the reintroduction of the waterfall grille to the Mercury brand, the model line was distinguished by two-tone (and later monochromatic) styling different from the Explorer. \n\nCoinciding with the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand, the Mountaineer was withdrawn after the 2010 model year; three generations were produced, with the Mountaineer serving as the largest Mercury SUV (above the [[Mercury Mariner|Mariner]]).<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1998-2001 Mercury Mountaineer.jpg|1998-2001 Mercury Mountaineer\nFile:Mercury Mountaineer.jpg|2002-2005 Mercury Mountaineer \nFile:3rd Mercury Mountaineer -- 03-05-2010.jpg|2006-2010 Mercury Mountaineer \n</gallery>\n\n=== Lincoln Aviator ===\n[[File:2003-Aviator-weiss-1.JPG|thumb|2003 Lincoln Aviator]]\n[[File:2019 Lincoln Aviator prototype 01.jpg|thumb|2020-present Lincoln Aviator]]{{Main|Lincoln Aviator}}\nThe Ford Explorer has been sold twice by the Lincoln division as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].  From 2003 to 2005, the Lincoln Aviator was marketed as a counterpart of the third-generation Explorer.  The first mid-size SUV sold by Lincoln, the model line was slotted between the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.  Following the introduction of the fourth-generation Explorer, the model line was repackaged as a CUV based on the [[Ford Edge]] and renamed the [[Lincoln MKX]] (today the Lincoln Nautilus).\n\nFor 2020, the Lincoln Aviator was revived (after a 14-year hiatus) as a mid-size SUV; as before, the model line is a Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Explorer (now the sixth generation) and the Lincoln Navigator.  The second-generation Aviator is the first Lincoln vehicle offered as with [[plug-in hybrid]] capability as an option; its 494 hp combined output is the highest-ever for a Lincoln vehicle.\n\n== Export sales ==\n\n===UK models===\nIn the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification \u2013 the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black.\n\n===Middle East and Asia===\nIn the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer is currently available in several trims, all of which have a 3.5-liter V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drivearabia.com/news/2011/08/24/ford-explorer-2011-2012-gcc-specifications-dubai-uae-gcc/|title=Ford Explorer 2011-2012 full GCC spec-sheets|website=Drive Arabia}}</ref> The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ford.co.jp/|title=Ford Japan|work=ford.co.jp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001082041/https://www.ford.co.jp/|archivedate=October 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Current exports===\nAs of 2009, the Explorer is also sold in Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Iceland, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.\n\nAs of 2014, the Explorer is also available in Ukraine and Belarus.

Both companies' reputations were tarnished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/autosafety/article_redirect.cfm?ID=5413|title=Public Citizen Auto Safety|work=citizen.org}}</ref> This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.\n\nRollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/> The previous Bronco II had already been cited by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' for rollover tendencies in turns.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/>\n\nThe Explorer was cleared by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely. It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a9399/why-blowouts-happen-and-how-to-avoid-them-15832078/|title=Why Blowouts Happen\u2014and How to Avoid Them|author=Mac Demere|work=Popular Mechanics}}</ref> A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer's center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.\n\nExplorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control on many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle .<ref>{{cite web|author=Pat McCarty |url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com |title=Ford Explorer Rollover |publisher=Ford Explorer Rollover |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2000, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted Ford and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about a higher than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[#Mazda Navajo (1991-1994)|Mazda Navajo]]s fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved ''tread separation'', in which the outer tread carcass would [[delamination|delaminate]] and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant.\n\nFord recommended a tire inflation of only {{convert|26|psi|0}} likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.<ref name=\"autosafety.org\"/>\n\nFord argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to {{convert|30|psi|0}} on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.\n\nSome have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowout was a contributing factor.<ref name=\"Wards\">\"Bad Drivers, Good Credibility \u2013 car makers face uphill struggle against public perception\", ''Ward's Auto World'', April 2001</ref> When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle's weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for ''[[Car and Driver|Car & Driver]]'' magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Wards\"/><ref>[[Doron Levin]] column, ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', October 27, 2000</ref> According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths were caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two.<ref>Dan Ackman, \"Ford, Firestone Face Off\", ''[[Forbes]]'', June 19, 2001</ref> Many vehicle injury attorneys dissent from this view.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psblaw.com/2010/08/31/tire-separation-causes-california-auto-accident-involving-police-officer/|title=Tire Separation Causes California Auto Accident Involving Police Officer|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2010|website=Panish, Shea & Boyle LLP|publisher=Panish, Shea & Boyle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tire Tread Separation - 2 Theories of Liability.doc |website=Cdrb-law.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328225419/https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Firestone's allegations of the Explorer's design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required.

When the engine is run for an extended period of time with this issue, the engine can jump timing or cease from running, damaging the heads and valves.\n\nTiming chain rattle was mitigated in later years of the SOHC (in most vehicles, after 2002) with updated cassettes and tensioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.underhoodservice.com/exploring-service-needs-on-the-ford-4-0l-v6-engine/|date=Apr 15, 2013|title=\u2018Exploring\u2019 Service Needs On The Ford 4.0L V6 Engine|first=Larry |last=Carley|website=Underhood Service|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 5R55 series transmissions found on second through fourth generation Explorers was also notorious for premature failures.

For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which [[coccolithophores]], single-celled [[alga]]e with small [[calcite]] skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today.\n\nOverlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of [[clay-with-flints]]. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by [[cryoturbation]] and decalcification of the chalk.<ref name=Gallois>{{cite journal |last1=Gallois |first1= RW |title= The origin of the Clay-with-flints: the missing link|journal=Geoscience in South-West England|date=2009|volume=12|pages=153\u2013161}}</ref> This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.<ref name=Gallois/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Clay-with Flints formation|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=CWF|website=The BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units|publisher=BGS|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Betchworth limekiln - geograph.org.uk - 869914.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Smidth Kiln at [[Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns|Betchworth Quarry]] was constructed in around 1901.<ref name=NHL_Betchworth>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1021346}}</ref>]]\nThe sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the [[Quaternary]].

Album was released as a double album, but later also distributed as separate long plays. By 1983, the album had sold more than 7 million copies in the USSR.\n\nThe album contains studio recordings from 1980\u20131981; the second disc of the album contains several live recordings from 1981 from one of the solo concerts of Pugacheva's program \"Monologues of a singer\".\n\nThere was also an export version of the album called ''How Disturbing Is This Way'' for distribution abroad. In Czechoslovakia album was released in 1984 by the name ''D\u00e1vn\u00e1 P\u00edse\u0148''.\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 1980, Pugacheva began shooting in the lead role in the film ''[[Dusha|Recital]]'', but was subsequently suspended from work and did not tour in the USSR for several months. In November\u2013December 1980, she toured [[Czechoslovakia]] (as part of the programme \"Days of culture of the USSR in Czechoslovakia\") and in the cities of Germany. In [[Cologne]], Pugacheva participated in the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] radio concert as part of the international music festival. In December 1980, for the first time since the September incident with ''Recital'' Pugacheva performed in the USSR \u2014 in the Moscow variety Theater, she gave a series of concerts \"Alla Pugacheva Theater\".\n\nPreparation for filming in the film \"Recital\" and for concerts for guests of the \"Olympics-80\", as a result \u2014 infrequent tours and rare appearances of Pugacheva on Central television in 1980 affected her popularity. In 1980, there were almost no new hits. The songs \"Moskovsky romans\", \"Ukhodya - ukhodi\", \"Kogda ya ujdu\", \"Kak trevozhen etot put\" did not gain much popularity among listeners. And only one song became the most popular - \"Uletaj, tucha\", by the then unknown composer Viktor Reznikov. For this reason, for the first time in 4 years, Pugacheva did not become a winner of the all-Union festival \"[[Pesnya goda]]\". In General, 1980 was a difficult and crucial year in the singer's creative and personal life, separating the period of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n== Release ==\nPugacheva finished work on the album in 1981, but [[Melodiya]] constantly delayed its release. As a result, the album was released only in September 1982. In anticipation of the album's release, three singles were released as minions \"Maestro\",\"Dezhurny angel\" and \"Ya bolshe ne revnuyu\". Originally released as a double album, it was later also distributed as separate records: ''Kak trevozhen etot put 1'' and ''Kak trevozhen etot put 2''.\n\n== Recording ==\nAt the end of 1980, Pugacheva started working on the record. In \"[[Little Blue Light]]\" in 1980\u201381, Pugacheva performs the song \"Maestro\" to the music of the Latvian composer [[Raimonds Pauls]] and poems by [[Ilya Reznik]]. Thanks to this song, there is a creative tandem \"Reznik-Pauls-Pugacheva\" and such songs as \"Starinniye chasy\", \"Vosvrashcheniye\", \"Bez menya\", \"Delu vremya\" and others. The composer of almost all the songs from the album was Pugacheva herself. The music for the three compositions was written by Raimonds Pauls, the song \"Beda\" was written by [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], which in the early 1980s was often performed by Alla Pugacheva at solo concerts, in particular in the concert program \"Monologues of the singer\". Vysotsky wrote \"Beda\" for his wife [[Marina Vladi]] in 1973. The album also includes several concert recordings from 1981 from one of the solo concerts of Pugacheva's program \"Monologues of a singer\".\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n |collapsed       =

album by Russian Soviet singer [[Alla Pugacheva]] released in 1982 by [[Melodiya]]. Album was released as a double album, but later also distributed as separate long plays. By 1983, the album had sold more than 7 million copies in the USSR.\n\nThe album contains studio recordings from 1980-1981; the second disc of the album contains several live recordings from 1981 from one of the solo concerts of Pugacheva's program \"Monologues of a singer\".\n\nThere was also an export version of the album called ''How Disturbing Is This Way'' for distribution abroad. In Czechoslovakia album was released in 1984 by the name ''D\u00e1vn\u00e1 P\u00edse\u0148''.\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 1980, Pugacheva began shooting in the lead role in the film ''[[Dusha|Recital]]'', but was subsequently suspended from work and did not tour in the USSR for several months. In November-December 1980, she toured [[Czechoslovakia]] (as part of the programme \"Days of culture of the USSR in Czechoslovakia\") and in the cities of Germany. In [[Cologne]], Pugacheva participated in the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] radio concert as part of the international music festival. In December 1980, for the first time since the September incident with ''Recital'' Pugacheva performed in the USSR \u2014 in the Moscow variety Theater, she gave a series of concerts \"Alla Pugacheva Theater\".\n\nPreparation for filming in the film \"Recital\" and for concerts for guests of the \"Olympics-80\", as a result \u2014 infrequent tours and rare appearances of Pugacheva on Central television in 1980 affected her popularity. In 1980, there were almost no new hits. The songs \"Moskovsky romans\", \"Ukhodya - ukhodi\", \"Kogda ya ujdu\", \"Kak trevozhen etot put\" did not gain much popularity among listeners. And only one song became the most popular - \"Uletaj, tucha\", by the then unknown composer Viktor Reznikov. For this reason, for the first time in 4 years, Pugacheva did not become a winner of the all-Union festival \"[[Pesnya goda]]\". In General, 1980 was a difficult and crucial year in the singer's creative and personal life, separating the period of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n== Release ==\nPugacheva finished work on the album in 1981, but [[Melodiya]] constantly delayed its release. As a result, the album was released only in September 1982. In anticipation of the album's release, three singles were released as minions \"Maestro\",\"Dezhurny angel\" and \"Ya bolshe ne revnuyu\". Originally released as a double album, it was later also distributed as separate records: ''Kak trevozhen etot put 1'' and ''Kak trevozhen etot put 2''.\n\n== Recording ==\nAt the end of 1980, Pugacheva started working on the record. In \"[[Little Blue Light]]\" in 1980-81, Pugacheva performs the song \"Maestro\" to the music of the Latvian composer [[Raimonds Pauls]] and poems by [[Ilya Reznik]]. Thanks to this song, there is a creative tandem \"Reznik-Pauls-Pugacheva\" and such songs as \"Starinniye chasy\", \"Vosvrashcheniye\", \"Bez menya\", \"Delu vremya\" and others. The composer of almost all the songs from the album was Pugacheva herself. The music for the three compositions was written by Raimonds Pauls, the song \"Beda\" was written by [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], which in the early 1980s was often performed by Alla Pugacheva at solo concerts, in particular in the concert program \"Monologues of the singer\". Vysotsky wrote \"Beda\" for his wife [[Marina Vladi]] in 1973. The album also includes several concert recordings from 1981 from one of the solo concerts of Pugacheva's program \"Monologues of a singer\".\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n |collapsed       =
