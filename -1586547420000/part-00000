{"title_page": "Cavalry in the American Civil War", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Cavalry Orderly Edwin Forbes.jpg|thumb|''Cavalry orderly, Rappahannock Station, Va.'', painting by [[Edwin Forbes]]]]\n\n'''The American Civil War''' saw cavalry tactics move largely away from the offensive towards the defensive, with the emphasis on screening, reconnaissance, raiding and harassment. Development of the rifled musket had also rendered the cavalry charge impractical.\n\nIn the first half of the war, the Confederates enjoyed the advantage in cavalry, as southern men were more accustomed to the riding and shooting life, and most of the experienced cavalry officers from the regular army had chosen to side with the Confederacy.\n\nBy the second half, from 1863 onward, the Union Army had gained an equal cavalry capability, through [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s brilliant deception tactics in the Mississippi valley, and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s aggressive movements, while in command of the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] at the end of the war in Virginia.\n\nCavalry units proved highly expensive to maintain, and unscrupulous agents would often exploit shortages by supplying defective animals at exorbitant prices.\n\n==Types of mounted forces==\n[[File:Recruiting poster New York Mounted Rifles.jpg|thumb|Recruiting poster for the [[1st Regiment New York Mounted Rifles|First Battalion, New York Mounted Rifles]] ]]\nThere were four types of mounted forces prevalent in the Civil War.\n\n# [[Cavalry]] were forces that fought principally on horseback, armed with [[carbine]]s, [[pistol]]s, and [[saber]]s. Only a small percentage of Civil War forces met this definition&mdash;primarily [[Union Army|Union]] mounted forces in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] during the first half of the war. [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces in the East generally carried neither carbines nor sabers. A few Confederate regiments in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] carried [[shotgun]]s, especially early in the war.\n# [[Mounted infantry]] were forces that moved on horseback but dismounted for fighting on foot, armed principally with [[rifled musket|rifles]]. In the second half of the war, most of the units considered to be cavalry actually fought battles using the tactics of mounted infantry. An example of this was the celebrated \"Lightning Brigade\" of Col. [[John T. Wilder]], which used horses to quickly arrive at a battlefield such as [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], but they deployed and fought using standard infantry formations and tactics. By contrast, at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Federal cavalry under [[John Buford]] also dismounted to fight Confederate infantry, but they used conventional [[cavalry tactics]], arms, and formations.\n# [[Dragoon]]s were hybrid forces that were armed as cavalrymen but were expected to fight on foot as well. The term comes from the [[French Army]], representing a cross between light cavalry and infantry. The fighting tactics of the forces deployed by Union General [[Philip Sheridan]] in 1864, and by Confederate General [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] after the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], fit the dragoon model, although those units did not adopt the term.\n# [[Irregular forces]] ([[partisan (military)|partisan]] rangers or [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]) were generally mounted forces. There is little commonality as to their weapons&mdash;in general, any available were used. The Confederacy produced the most famous irregular leaders, including [[William Clarke Quantrill]] and [[John S. Mosby]].\n\n==Roles==\n\nAt the time of the Civil War, the [[cavalry]] had five major missions, in rough priority:\n\n# [[Reconnaissance]] and counter-reconnaissance screening\n# Defensive, delaying actions\n# Pursuit and harassment of defeated enemy forces\n# Offensive actions\n# Long-distance raiding against enemy lines of communications, supply depots, railroads, etc.\n\nThis represented a change from previous eras, in which offensive action was the primary mission. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for instance, there were instances of massive cavalry charges used for tactical envelopments of infantry formations. The technology of the rifled musket, which emerged in the 1850s, put an effective end to this practice. While swiftly moving cavalry could overwhelm infantry whose weapons fired accurately only 100 yards, the infantryman with a rifled musket (accurate to 300 yards or more) could fire multiple rounds in the time it took the cavalry to reach his position. A horse and rider were easy targets for these shots.\n\nOffensive actions were certainly not unknown, however, but they were more frequently employed against enemy cavalry than against infantry. Examples of offensive actions include the [[Battle of Brandy Station]] and the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]]; cavalry versus cavalry examples include the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and [[Elon J. Farnsworth]]'s ill-fated charge on the third day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].\n\nReconnaissance was the key to effective cavalry, as it remains today in modern armies (although modern cavalrymen use light [[armored vehicle]]s or [[helicopter]]s instead of horses). The cavalry serves as the \"eyes\" of the army. Reconnaissance was a crucial component in the Gettysburg Campaign, where cavalry under Union General [[Alfred Pleasonton]] attempted to find the wide-ranging [[Army of Northern Virginia]] on its invasion of the [[Northern United States|North]], and Confederate cavalry under [[J.E.B. Stuart]] effectively employed counter-reconnaissance to screen passes in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and hide [[Robert E. Lee]]'s movements.\n\nLong-distance raids were the most desirable mission for cavalrymen, primarily because of the fame that successful raids would bring, but they were often of little practical strategic value. Jeb Stuart became famous for two audacious raids on the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1862; in his third such attempt, during the Gettysburg Campaign, he squandered much of the cavalry forces of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and deprived Robert E. Lee of adequate reconnaissance at the beginning of the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the principal reasons for the Confederate defeat there. Union attempts at strategic raids had mixed success. [[George Stoneman]]'s raid in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] was a failure; [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s [[Grierson's Raid|raid]] in the [[Vicksburg Campaign]] was a strategic masterpiece that diverted critical Confederate forces away from [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s army; [[James H. Wilson]]'s massive 1865 raid in [[Alabama]] foreshadowed the armored warfare maneuvers of [[World War II]]. In general, strategic raids were used more effectively in the Western Theater of the war.\n\nDefensive actions by the cavalry were critical in the retreat from Gettysburg. Pursuit and harassment of enemy forces were often neglected (particularly by the Union after Gettysburg and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]), but can be seen in their finest form in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee during the [[Appomattox Campaign]].\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Cavalry Sergeant, 1866]]\nUntil the nomenclature changed in the early 1880s, cavalry regiments were organized into companies (later, \"troops\") authorized at up to 100 men, ten companies made up a regiment (increased to twelve post-war).   Two or more companies might be organized into ad hoc battalions (later, \"squadrons\"), two \"wings\" of six companies each was used through the Indian Wars.  Civil War regiments were rarely near authorized strength so that they were commonly brigaded with two to four other regiments.  Two to four brigades were combined into divisions.  By the end of the war, 272 cavalry regiments were formed in the Union Army and 137 in the Confederate Army.\n\nEarly in the war, most cavalry regiments were dispersed to be under the command of infantry formations, such as [[division (military)|divisions]] or [[corps]]. As commanders realized the importance of long-range reconnaissance and raiding, the organizations changed to consolidate more of the regiments into larger units controlled separately. Eventually the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] included a Cavalry Corps, which had three divisions. The Army of Northern Virginia, earlier to consolidate under J.E.B. Stuart, organized its force as a cavalry division.\n\nIn both armies, the cavalry was accompanied by batteries or battalions of [[horse artillery]], as well as its own train of ammunition and supply wagons.\n\n==Equipment==\n===Horses===\nThe principal item of equipment for a cavalryman was the [[horse]] and one of the reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster-issued animals obtained through public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory.<ref>National Archives, RG 92, James A. Ekin to Montgomery Meigs, January 31, 1866</ref>\n\nUnion army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed.<ref>National Archives, RG 92, Quartermaster Department Circular, \"Instructions for Inspectors of Cavalry Horses,\" February 5, 1864; Gerleman, David J. \"Warhorse! Union Cavalry Mounts.\" North and South Magazine (January 1999)</ref>\n\nCavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end.<ref>Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives, 37th Cong., 2d sess., 1861-62, part I, 84; O.R.III, vol. 5, 256</ref> The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed.<ref>O.R. Series I, vol. XXIX, pt. 2, 423</ref>\n\nOn both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.<ref>\"Our Cavalry,\" The United States Army and Navy Journal, I (February 1864); Gerleman, David J. \"A Blot on the Army: Veterinary Care in the Union Cavalry, 1861\u20131865,\" Smithsonian Institution Civil War Sesquicentennial Symposium, November 2012</ref>\n\nHorses gave the cavalry forces significant mobility. In some operations, forces were pushed to the limit (such as Jeb Stuart's raid on [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], in 1862, where his troopers marched 80 miles (130&nbsp;km) in 27 hours). Such excesses were extremely damaging to the readiness of the units and extensive recovery periods were required. Stuart, during the Gettysburg Campaign the following year, resorted to procuring replacement horses from local farmers and townspeople during his grueling trek northward around the Union army. In [[York County, Pennsylvania]], following the [[Battle of Hanover]], his men appropriated well over 1,000 horses from the region. Many of these untrained new mounts proved a hindrance during the subsequent fighting at East Cavalry Field during the battle of Gettysburg.\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:A. J. Blue, cavalry soldier in Union shell jacket and bummer cap with three Remington revolvers in his belt, holding a sword LCCN2011645425.jpg|thumb|right|Union cavalryman A.J. Blue armed with three pistols and a sword.]]\nSome mounted forces used traditional infantry rifles. However, cavalrymen, particularly in the North, were frequently armed with three other weapons:\n\n* Carbines, with a shorter barrel than a rifle, were less accurate, but easier to handle on horseback. Most carbines were .52- or .56-[[caliber]], single-shot [[breech-loading weapon]]s. They were manufactured by several different companies, but the most common were the [[Sharps Rifle#Sharps military carbine|Sharps]], the [[Burnside carbine|Burnside]], and the [[Smith carbine|Smith]]. Late in 1863, the seven-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer]] repeating carbine was introduced, but it was rarely deployed. A notable exception was Union Colonel John T. Wilder, who equipped an entire brigade with repeaters (purchasing these himself and intending to deduct payment from the men's wages embarrassed the Government into paying Wilder for the weapons at $35 apiece) in May 1863, the first unit so equipped. His mounted infantry gained fame as the \"Lightning Brigade\" for their swift movements. One Confederate stated that Wilder's men could \"load on Sunday and fire all week.\" (Confederate forces were able to use captured breechloaders but were unable to duplicate the metallic cartridges needed by the Spencer.)\n\n* Pistols, which Southern cavalrymen generally preferred over sabers, were usually six-shot [[revolver]]s, in .36- or .44-caliber, from [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] or [[Remington Arms|Remington]]. They were useful only in close fighting since they had little accuracy. It was common for cavalrymen to carry two revolvers, for extra firepower, and John Mosby's troopers often carried four each.\n\n* Sabers were used frequently by cavalrymen on both sides. They were terror weapons, more useful for instilling fear in their opponents than as practical offensive weapons; Confederate cavalrymen often avoided them simply because they considered sabers to be outmoded, unsuitable for the modern battlefield. One Southern cavalry commander noted that the only times during the war he used a saber was to roast meat over a fire. Despite some Southern attitudes towards such weapons, there were several notable instances where the saber saw much use by both sides, including the [[Battle of Brandy Station]] and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles|cavalry battles on the third day of Gettysburg]]. Notably, South Carolina cavalry regiments as well as the cavalry commanded by General Wade Hampton had an intense fondness for the saber. One officer in the 2nd South Carolina cavalry regiment was quoted saying, \"There was nothing Hampton's men liked so well in a fight as a chance to use their sabers.\" The American Pattern of 1860 Light Cavalry Saber was lighter than the typical European saber, the latter being similar to the older U.S. Model 1840 Heavy Dragoon \"wrist breaker\".\n\n==Confederate cavalry==\n[[Image:Confederate cavalry 1st virginia bw.jpg|thumb|300px|Sketch of [[1st Virginia Cavalry]]]]\n[[File:John Richard Whitehead CSA.jpg|thumb|Sgt. John Richard Whitehead, Company G, 6th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia]]]]\nA [[Southern United States|Southerner]] was, on average, considered a superior horseman to his [[Northern United States|Northern]] counterpart, especially early in the war. Roads in the rural South were generally poor, and horses were used more for individual transportation than they were for the carriages and streetcars of the urbanized North, where many of the early Federal cavalry regiments were formed.<ref>Hamner, Christopher. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24420 Union Cavalry].\" [http://wwwt.eachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed 11 July 2011.</ref> Furthermore, Southern society was more stratified, which made the soldiers more accustomed to a hierarchy of command and were generally considered more suited to the martial lifestyle.  Additionally, the strong militia tradition in the antebellum South and the requirements for local 'slave catcher' patrols led to the development of mounted units prior to 1861.\n\nConfederate soldiers owned their horses and were compensated on a monthly basis. If a soldier's horse was sick, injured, or killed, the soldier was responsible for returning home and replacing the horse at his own expense. The general rule was that the soldier had 60 days to return with a new horse or he was forced to become an infantryman, which was considered to be an ignominious fate.\n\nThe first prominent Confederate cavalry leader was J.E.B. Stuart, who achieved success in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] against infantry. He was a flamboyant dresser and an audacious commander, wildly popular with the Southern public for his escapades in twice encircling the Army of the Potomac. These long-range reconnaissance missions accomplished little of military value but boosted Southern morale. After Stuart's death in 1864, he was replaced by Wade Hampton, who was a more mature, and arguably more effective, commander. Another Eastern commander of note was [[Turner Ashby]], the \"Black Knight of the Confederacy\", who commanded [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s cavalry forces in the [[Valley Campaign]]; he was killed in battle in 1862.\n\nIn the Western Theater, the most fearless, and ruthless, cavalry commander was Nathan Bedford Forrest, who achieved spectacular results with small forces but was an ineffective subordinate to the army commanders he was supposed to support, resulting in poorly coordinated battles.  Much of the same issues could be said of Forrest's counterpart in the [[Army of Tennessee]], [[John Hunt Morgan]].  In the Eastern Theater, the Partisan Ranger [[John Singleton Mosby]] succeeded in tying down upwards of 40,000 Federal troops defending rail lines and logistical hubs with only 100-150 irregulars. In the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]], [[John S. Marmaduke]] and [[Joseph O. Shelby|\"Jo\" Shelby]] became prominent.\n\n{{Further|Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia}}\n\n==Union cavalry==\n[[File:Unioniste Lefaucheux.jpg|thumb|A US Civil war soldier  Cavalry [North] with sabre and Lefaucheux pistol; the brass guards on his shoulders were designed to protect against sword cuts]]\n[[Image:Union cavalry charge culpepper.jpg|thumb|300px|Union Cavalry capture Confederate artillery]]\nThe Union started the war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was initially reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could take as long as two years, and the conventional wisdom that the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being so different from that of [[Western Europe]], would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.<ref>\"Cavalry, U.S.A.\" in Encyclopedia of the American Civil War, David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds., Vol. 1, A-C, (ABC-CLIO Publishers, 2000), pp. 378-381</ref>\n\nThe Union cavalry was disadvantaged at the start of the war because Northern soldiers allegedly had less comparative equestrian experience than their Southern counterparts, and the Union army did not institute an examination in basic horsemanship before a recruit was mustered into service until August 1862.<ref>O.R. Series III, vol II, 381</ref> In addition, over half (104 out of 176) of the experienced U.S. Army cavalry officers had resigned their commissions to fight for the Confederacy. One advantage the Union horseman had over his opponent was the centralized horse procurement organization of the army, relieving him of any responsibility for replacing an injured horse. Commanders often tried to procure specific breeds for their men, with the [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] being a particular favorite within the Army of the Potomac. Famous Morgan cavalry mounts from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] included [[Philip H. Sheridan|Sheridan's]] \"Rienzi\"<ref>[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/rienzi3 Pedigree of Reinz], a famous [[Morgan horse]] used by General [[Philip H. Sheridan]].</ref> and [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s \"Little Sorrel\".\n\nEarly in the war, Union cavalry forces were often wasted by being used merely as pickets, outposts, orderlies, guards for senior officers, and messengers. The first officer to make effective use of the Union cavalry was Major General [[Joseph Hooker]], who in 1863 consolidated the cavalry forces of his [[Army of the Potomac]] under a single commander, [[George Stoneman]].\n\n[[File:Union cavalry charge at Honey Springs, 1863.jpg|thumb|left|Union cavalry charge at [[Battle of Honey Springs|Honey Springs]], July 1863.]]\nHalfway into the war, during the summer of 1863, the Union cavalry came into its own. Widely regarded as inferior to its Southern counterpart up until then, the [[Battle of Brandy Station]], although tactically indecisive, is recognized as the point at which it was acknowledged to have comparable competence.\n\nIn 1864, [[Philip Sheridan]] was given command of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and he deployed his horsemen in a more effective, strategic way than his predecessors. Despite the reluctance of his superior, Major General [[George G. Meade]], Sheridan convinced General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to allow him to deploy the cavalry in long-range raids, the first of which, at [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|Yellow Tavern]], resulted in the death of Confederate commander Jeb Stuart. He later employed his cavalry force effectively in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]] and the [[Appomattox Campaign]], in pursuit of Robert E. Lee.\n\nIn the Western Theater, two effective cavalry generals have not achieved the fame of their Eastern counterparts: [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s dramatic raid through Mississippi was an integral part of Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg Campaign; [[James H. Wilson]] was invaluable in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]] and in his 1865 Alabama raid.\n\n{{Further|Cavalry Corps (Union Army)}}\n{{Further|U.S. Army Remount Service}}\n\n==Significant cavalry battles and raids==\nThe following are Civil War battles, campaigns, or separate raids in which cavalry forces played a significant role.\n* [[Battle of Brandy Station]] &mdash; 20,500 combatants, in 1863, Pleasanton leads the largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war\n* [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] &mdash; ambitious plan for raid in the Confederate rear foiled by George Stoneman's inaction\n* [[Battle of Gaines's Mill]] &mdash; the first large cavalry engagement of the war\n* [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles]] &mdash; East Cavalry Field and [[Elon J.

Development of the rifled musket had also rendered the cavalry charge impractical.\n\nIn the first half of the war, the Confederates enjoyed the advantage in cavalry, as southern men were more accustomed to the riding and shooting life, and most of the experienced cavalry officers from the regular army had chosen to side with the Confederacy.\n\nBy the second half, from 1863 onward, the Union Army had gained an equal cavalry capability, through [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s brilliant deception tactics in the Mississippi valley, and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s aggressive movements, while in command of the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] at the end of the war in Virginia.\n\nCavalry units proved highly expensive to maintain, and unscrupulous agents would often exploit shortages by supplying defective animals at exorbitant prices.\n\n==Types of mounted forces==\n[[File:Recruiting poster New York Mounted Rifles.jpg|thumb|Recruiting poster for the [[1st Regiment New York Mounted Rifles|First Battalion, New York Mounted Rifles]] ]]\nThere were four types of mounted forces prevalent in the Civil War.\n\n# [[Cavalry]] were forces that fought principally on horseback, armed with [[carbine]]s, [[pistol]]s, and [[saber]]s. Only a small percentage of Civil War forces met this definition&mdash;primarily [[Union Army|Union]] mounted forces in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] during the first half of the war. [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces in the East generally carried neither carbines nor sabers. A few Confederate regiments in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] carried [[shotgun]]s, especially early in the war.\n# [[Mounted infantry]] were forces that moved on horseback but dismounted for fighting on foot, armed principally with [[rifled musket|rifles]]. In the second half of the war, most of the units considered to be cavalry actually fought battles using the tactics of mounted infantry. An example of this was the celebrated \"Lightning Brigade\" of Col. [[John T. Wilder]], which used horses to quickly arrive at a battlefield such as [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], but they deployed and fought using standard infantry formations and tactics. By contrast, at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Federal cavalry under [[John Buford]] also dismounted to fight Confederate infantry, but they used conventional [[cavalry tactics]], arms, and formations.\n# [[Dragoon]]s were hybrid forces that were armed as cavalrymen but were expected to fight on foot as well. The term comes from the [[French Army]], representing a cross between light cavalry and infantry. The fighting tactics of the forces deployed by Union General [[Philip Sheridan]] in 1864, and by Confederate General [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] after the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], fit the dragoon model, although those units did not adopt the term.\n# [[Irregular forces]] ([[partisan (military)|partisan]] rangers or [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]) were generally mounted forces. There is little commonality as to their weapons&mdash;in general, any available were used. The Confederacy produced the most famous irregular leaders, including [[William Clarke Quantrill]] and [[John S. Mosby]].\n\n==Roles==\n\nAt the time of the Civil War, the [[cavalry]] had five major missions, in rough priority:\n\n# [[Reconnaissance]] and counter-reconnaissance screening\n# Defensive, delaying actions\n# Pursuit and harassment of defeated enemy forces\n# Offensive actions\n# Long-distance raiding against enemy lines of communications, supply depots, railroads, etc.\n\nThis represented a change from previous eras, in which offensive action was the primary mission. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for instance, there were instances of massive cavalry charges used for tactical envelopments of infantry formations. The technology of the rifled musket, which emerged in the 1850s, put an effective end to this practice. While swiftly moving cavalry could overwhelm infantry whose weapons fired accurately only 100 yards, the infantryman with a rifled musket (accurate to 300 yards or more) could fire multiple rounds in the time it took the cavalry to reach his position. A horse and rider were easy targets for these shots.\n\nOffensive actions were certainly not unknown, however, but they were more frequently employed against enemy cavalry than against infantry. Examples of offensive actions include the [[Battle of Brandy Station]] and the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]]; cavalry versus cavalry examples include the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and [[Elon J. Farnsworth]]'s ill-fated charge on the third day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].\n\nReconnaissance was the key to effective cavalry, as it remains today in modern armies (although modern cavalrymen use light [[armored vehicle]]s or [[helicopter]]s instead of horses). The cavalry serves as the \"eyes\" of the army. Reconnaissance was a crucial component in the Gettysburg Campaign, where cavalry under Union General [[Alfred Pleasonton]] attempted to find the wide-ranging [[Army of Northern Virginia]] on its invasion of the [[Northern United States|North]], and Confederate cavalry under [[J.E.B. Stuart]] effectively employed counter-reconnaissance to screen passes in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and hide [[Robert E. Lee]]'s movements.\n\nLong-distance raids were the most desirable mission for cavalrymen, primarily because of the fame that successful raids would bring, but they were often of little practical strategic value. Jeb Stuart became famous for two audacious raids on the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1862; in his third such attempt, during the Gettysburg Campaign, he squandered much of the cavalry forces of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and deprived Robert E. Lee of adequate reconnaissance at the beginning of the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the principal reasons for the Confederate defeat there. Union attempts at strategic raids had mixed success. [[George Stoneman]]'s raid in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] was a failure; [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s [[Grierson's Raid|raid]] in the [[Vicksburg Campaign]] was a strategic masterpiece that diverted critical Confederate forces away from [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s army; [[James H. Wilson]]'s massive 1865 raid in [[Alabama]] foreshadowed the armored warfare maneuvers of [[World War II]]. In general, strategic raids were used more effectively in the Western Theater of the war.\n\nDefensive actions by the cavalry were critical in the retreat from Gettysburg. Pursuit and harassment of enemy forces were often neglected (particularly by the Union after Gettysburg and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]), but can be seen in their finest form in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee during the [[Appomattox Campaign]].\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Cavalry Sergeant, 1866]]\nUntil the nomenclature changed in the early 1880s, cavalry regiments were organized into companies (later, \"troops\") authorized at up to 100 men, ten companies made up a regiment (increased to twelve post-war).   Two or more companies might be organized into ad hoc battalions (later, \"squadrons\"), two \"wings\" of six companies each was used through the Indian Wars.  Civil War regiments were rarely near authorized strength so that they were commonly brigaded with two to four other regiments.  Two to four brigades were combined into divisions.  By the end of the war, 272 cavalry regiments were formed in the Union Army and 137 in the Confederate Army.\n\nEarly in the war, most cavalry regiments were dispersed to be under the command of infantry formations, such as [[division (military)|divisions]] or [[corps]]. As commanders realized the importance of long-range reconnaissance and raiding, the organizations changed to consolidate more of the regiments into larger units controlled separately. Eventually the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] included a Cavalry Corps, which had three divisions. The Army of Northern Virginia, earlier to consolidate under J.E.B. Stuart, organized its force as a cavalry division.\n\nIn both armies, the cavalry was accompanied by batteries or battalions of [[horse artillery]], as well as its own train of ammunition and supply wagons.\n\n==Equipment==\n===Horses===\nThe principal item of equipment for a cavalryman was the [[horse]] and one of the reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory.<ref>National Archives, RG 92, James A. Ekin to Montgomery Meigs, January 31, 1866</ref>\n\nUnion army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed.<ref>National Archives, RG 92, Quartermaster Department Circular, \"Instructions for Inspectors of Cavalry Horses,\" February 5, 1864; Gerleman, David J. \"Warhorse! Union Cavalry Mounts.\" North and South Magazine (January 1999)</ref>\n\nCavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end.<ref>Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives, 37th Cong., 2d sess., 1861-62, part I, 84; O.R.III, vol. 5, 256</ref> The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed.<ref>O.R. Series I, vol. XXIX, pt. 2, 423</ref>\n\nOn both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.<ref>\"Our Cavalry,\" The United States Army and Navy Journal, I (February 1864); Gerleman, David J. \"A Blot on the Army: Veterinary Care in the Union Cavalry, 1861\u20131865,\" Smithsonian Institution Civil War Sesquicentennial Symposium, November 2012</ref>\n\nHorses gave the cavalry forces significant mobility. In some operations, forces were pushed to the limit (such as Jeb Stuart's raid on [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], in 1862, where his troopers marched 80 miles (130&nbsp;km) in 27 hours). Such excesses were extremely damaging to the readiness of the units and extensive recovery periods were required. Stuart, during the Gettysburg Campaign the following year, resorted to procuring replacement horses from local farmers and townspeople during his grueling trek northward around the Union army. In [[York County, Pennsylvania]], following the [[Battle of Hanover]], his men appropriated well over 1,000 horses from the region. Many of these untrained new mounts proved a hindrance during the subsequent fighting at East Cavalry Field during the battle of Gettysburg.\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:A. J. Blue, cavalry soldier in Union shell jacket and bummer cap with three Remington revolvers in his belt, holding a sword LCCN2011645425.jpg|thumb|right|Union cavalryman A.J. Blue armed with three pistols and a sword.]]\nSome mounted forces used traditional infantry rifles. However, cavalrymen, particularly in the North, were frequently armed with three other weapons:\n\n* Carbines, with a shorter barrel than a rifle, were less accurate, but easier to handle on horseback. Most carbines were .52- or .56-[[caliber]], single-shot [[breech-loading weapon]]s. They were manufactured by several different companies, but the most common were the [[Sharps Rifle#Sharps military carbine|Sharps]], the [[Burnside carbine|Burnside]], and the [[Smith carbine|Smith]]. Late in 1863, the seven-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer]] repeating carbine was introduced, but it was rarely deployed. A notable exception was Union Colonel John T. Wilder, who equipped an entire brigade with repeaters (purchasing these himself and intending to deduct payment from the men's wages embarrassed the Government into paying Wilder for the weapons at $35 apiece) in May 1863, the first unit so equipped. His mounted infantry gained fame as the \"Lightning Brigade\" for their swift movements. One Confederate stated that Wilder's men could \"load on Sunday and fire all week.\" (Confederate forces were able to use captured breechloaders but were unable to duplicate the metallic cartridges needed by the Spencer.)\n\n* Pistols, which Southern cavalrymen generally preferred over sabers, were usually six-shot [[revolver]]s, in .36- or .44-caliber, from [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] or [[Remington Arms|Remington]]. They were useful only in close fighting since they had little accuracy. It was common for cavalrymen to carry two revolvers, for extra firepower, and John Mosby's troopers often carried four each.\n\n* Sabers were used frequently by cavalrymen on both sides. They were terror weapons, more useful for instilling fear in their opponents than as practical offensive weapons; Confederate cavalrymen often avoided them simply because they considered sabers to be outmoded, unsuitable for the modern battlefield. One Southern cavalry commander noted that the only times during the war he used a saber was to roast meat over a fire. Despite some Southern attitudes towards such weapons, there were several notable instances where the saber saw much use by both sides, including the [[Battle of Brandy Station]] and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles|cavalry battles on the third day of Gettysburg]]. Notably, South Carolina cavalry regiments as well as the cavalry commanded by General Wade Hampton had an intense fondness for the saber. One officer in the 2nd South Carolina cavalry regiment was quoted saying, \"There was nothing Hampton's men liked so well in a fight as a chance to use their sabers.\" The American Pattern of 1860 Light Cavalry Saber was lighter than the typical European saber, the latter being similar to the older U.S. Model 1840 Heavy Dragoon \"wrist breaker\".\n\n==Confederate cavalry==\n[[Image:Confederate cavalry 1st virginia bw.jpg|thumb|300px|Sketch of [[1st Virginia Cavalry]]]]\n[[File:John Richard Whitehead CSA.jpg|thumb|Sgt. John Richard Whitehead, Company G, 6th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia]]]]\nA [[Southern United States|Southerner]] was, on average, considered a superior horseman to his [[Northern United States|Northern]] counterpart, especially early in the war. Roads in the rural South were generally poor, and horses were used more for individual transportation than they were for the carriages and streetcars of the urbanized North, where many of the early Federal cavalry regiments were formed.<ref>Hamner, Christopher. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24420 Union Cavalry].\" [http://wwwt.eachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed 11 July 2011.</ref> Furthermore, Southern society was more stratified, which made the soldiers more accustomed to a hierarchy of command and were generally considered more suited to the martial lifestyle.  Additionally, the strong militia tradition in the antebellum South and the requirements for local 'slave catcher' patrols led to the development of mounted units prior to 1861.\n\nConfederate soldiers owned their horses and were compensated on a monthly basis. If a soldier's horse was sick, injured, or killed, the soldier was responsible for returning home and replacing the horse at his own expense. The general rule was that the soldier had 60 days to return with a new horse or he was forced to become an infantryman, which was considered to be an ignominious fate.\n\nThe first prominent Confederate cavalry leader was J.E.B. Stuart, who achieved success in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] against infantry. He was a flamboyant dresser and an audacious commander, wildly popular with the Southern public for his escapades in twice encircling the Army of the Potomac. These long-range reconnaissance missions accomplished little of military value but boosted Southern morale. After Stuart's death in 1864, he was replaced by Wade Hampton, who was a more mature, and arguably more effective, commander. Another Eastern commander of note was [[Turner Ashby]], the \"Black Knight of the Confederacy\", who commanded [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s cavalry forces in the [[Valley Campaign]]; he was killed in battle in 1862.\n\nIn the Western Theater, the most fearless, and ruthless, cavalry commander was Nathan Bedford Forrest, who achieved spectacular results with small forces but was an ineffective subordinate to the army commanders he was supposed to support, resulting in poorly coordinated battles.  Much of the same issues could be said of Forrest's counterpart in the [[Army of Tennessee]], [[John Hunt Morgan]].  In the Eastern Theater, the Partisan Ranger [[John Singleton Mosby]] succeeded in tying down upwards of 40,000 Federal troops defending rail lines and logistical hubs with only 100-150 irregulars. In the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]], [[John S. Marmaduke]] and [[Joseph O. Shelby|\"Jo\" Shelby]] became prominent.\n\n{{Further|Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia}}\n\n==Union cavalry==\n[[File:Unioniste Lefaucheux.jpg|thumb|A US Civil war soldier  Cavalry [North] with sabre and Lefaucheux pistol; the brass guards on his shoulders were designed to protect against sword cuts]]\n[[Image:Union cavalry charge culpepper.jpg|thumb|300px|Union Cavalry capture Confederate artillery]]\nThe Union started the war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was initially reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could take as long as two years, and the conventional wisdom that the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being so different from that of [[Western Europe]], would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.<ref>\"Cavalry, U.S.A.\" in Encyclopedia of the American Civil War, David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds., Vol. 1, A-C, (ABC-CLIO Publishers, 2000), pp. 378-381</ref>\n\nThe Union cavalry was disadvantaged at the start of the war because Northern soldiers allegedly had less comparative equestrian experience than their Southern counterparts, and the Union army did not institute an examination in basic horsemanship before a recruit was mustered into service until August 1862.<ref>O.R. Series III, vol II, 381</ref> In addition, over half (104 out of 176) of the experienced U.S. Army cavalry officers had resigned their commissions to fight for the Confederacy. One advantage the Union horseman had over his opponent was the centralized horse procurement organization of the army, relieving him of any responsibility for replacing an injured horse. Commanders often tried to procure specific breeds for their men, with the [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] being a particular favorite within the Army of the Potomac. Famous Morgan cavalry mounts from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] included [[Philip H. Sheridan|Sheridan's]] \"Rienzi\"<ref>[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/rienzi3 Pedigree of Reinz], a famous [[Morgan horse]] used by General [[Philip H. Sheridan]].</ref> and [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s \"Little Sorrel\".\n\nEarly in the war, Union cavalry forces were often wasted by being used merely as pickets, outposts, orderlies, guards for senior officers, and messengers. The first officer to make effective use of the Union cavalry was Major General [[Joseph Hooker]], who in 1863 consolidated the cavalry forces of his [[Army of the Potomac]] under a single commander, [[George Stoneman]].\n\n[[File:Union cavalry charge at Honey Springs, 1863.jpg|thumb|left|Union cavalry charge at [[Battle of Honey Springs|Honey Springs]], July 1863.]]\nHalfway into the war, during the summer of 1863, the Union cavalry came into its own. Widely regarded as inferior to its Southern counterpart up until then, the [[Battle of Brandy Station]], although tactically indecisive, is recognized as the point at which it was acknowledged to have comparable competence.\n\nIn 1864, [[Philip Sheridan]] was given command of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and he deployed his horsemen in a more effective, strategic way than his predecessors. Despite the reluctance of his superior, Major General [[George G. Meade]], Sheridan convinced General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to allow him to deploy the cavalry in long-range raids, the first of which, at [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|Yellow Tavern]], resulted in the death of Confederate commander Jeb Stuart. He later employed his cavalry force effectively in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]] and the [[Appomattox Campaign]], in pursuit of Robert E. Lee.\n\nIn the Western Theater, two effective cavalry generals have not achieved the fame of their Eastern counterparts: [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s dramatic raid through Mississippi was an integral part of Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg Campaign; [[James H. Wilson]] was invaluable in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]] and in his 1865 Alabama raid.\n\n{{Further|Cavalry Corps (Union Army)}}\n{{Further|U.S. Army Remount Service}}\n\n==Significant cavalry battles and raids==\nThe following are Civil War battles, campaigns, or separate raids in which cavalry forces played a significant role.\n* [[Battle of Brandy Station]] &mdash; 20,500 combatants, in 1863, Pleasanton leads the largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war\n* [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] &mdash; ambitious plan for raid in the Confederate rear foiled by George Stoneman's inaction\n* [[Battle of Gaines's Mill]] &mdash; the first large cavalry engagement of the war\n* [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles]] &mdash; East Cavalry Field and [[Elon J.

Initial cases related to people who had travelled to Italy, as well as a group of pilgrims who had travelled to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Israel|Israel]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Egypt|Egypt]] and their contacts.\n\n{{As of|2020|04|9|df=UK}}, there have been 1955 confirmed cases and 86 deaths. Health authorities recommend travellers who have returned from affected areas or people who have been in contact with such travellers to stay home for a minimum of 14 days. It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all [[carnival]] events in the country were cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March, the Greek authorities announced restrictions on all non-essential movement throughout the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Since that date, movement outside the house is permitted only for seven categories of reasons: i) moving to or from one's workplace during work hours, ii) going to the pharmacy or visiting a doctor iii) going to a food store iv) going to the bank for services not possible online, v) assisting a person in need of help vi) going to a major ritual (funeral, marriage, baptism) or movement, for divorced parents, which is essential for contact with their children, and vii) moving outdoors, near one's home, for exercising or taking one's pet out, individually or in pairs.

Initial cases related to people who had travelled to Italy, as well as a group of pilgrims who had travelled to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Israel|Israel]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Egypt|Egypt]] and their contacts.\n\n{{As of|2020|04|9|df=UK}}, there have been 1955 confirmed cases and 86 deaths. Health authorities recommend travellers who have returned from affected areas or people who have been in contact with such travellers to stay home for a minimum of 14 days. It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all [[carnival]] events in the country were cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March, the Greek authorities announced restrictions on all non-essential movement throughout the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Since that date, movement outside the house is permitted only for seven categories of reasons: i) moving to or from one's workplace during work hours, ii) going to the pharmacy or visiting a doctor iii) going to a food store iv) going to the bank for services not possible online, v) assisting a person in need of help vi) going to a major ritual (funeral, marriage, baptism) or movement, for divorced parents, which is essential for contact with their children, and vii) moving outdoors, near one's home, for exercising or taking one's pet out, individually or in pairs. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as a signed attestation in which the purpose or category of travel is stated. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense. On 4 April these restrictions were extended until 27 April. \n\nThe measures put in place in Greece are some of the most proactive and strict in Europe and have been hailed internationally for slowing the spread of the disease and keeping the number of deaths among the lowest on the continent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-10/greece-handled-coronavirus-crisis-better-than-italy-and-spain|title=Greece Shows How to Handle the Crisis|last=Giugliano|first=Ferdinando|date=10 April 2020|via=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/scientists-coronavirus-heroes.html|title=The Rising Heroes of the Coronavirus Era?

He mentions in his book ''Wall and Piece'' that as he was starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number. He then devised a series of intricate stencils to minimise time and overlapping of the colour.\n\nThere exists a debate about the influence behind his work. Some critics claim Banksy was influenced by musician and graffiti artist [[Robert Del Naja|3D]]. Another source credits the artist's work to resemble that of French graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]]. It is said that Banksy was inspired by their use of stencils, later taking this visual style and transforming it through modern political and social pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/27050301|title=Road sign believed to be a Banksy has vanished|date=13 August 2018|website=BBC Newsround|access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBanksy's stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly.\n\nIn the broader art world, [[Stencil#Aerosol stencils|stencils]] are traditionally hand drawn or printed onto sheets of acetate or card, before being cut out by hand. This technique allows artists to paint quickly to protect their anonymity. There is dispute in the street art world over the legitimacy of stencils, with many artists criticising their use as \"cheating\".\n\nIn 2018, Banksy created a piece live, as it was being auctioned. The piece, titled, [[Love is in the Bin]], was originally the painting, [[Girl with Balloon]], before it was shredded at [[Sotheby's]]. While the bidding was going on, a shredder was activated from within the frame, and the piece was partially shredded, thus creating a new piece.\n\n== Political and social themes ==\n[[File:Shop Until You Drop by Banksy.JPG|thumb|right|''Shop Until You Drop'' in Mayfair, London.

Additionally, the components of the [[human condition]] that his works commonly critique are [[greed]], poverty, [[hypocrisy]], [[boredom]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], [[absurdity]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jonathon |last=Keats |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/08/03/why-banksy-deserves-an-olympic-gold-more-than-usain-bolt/ |title=Why Banksy Deserves An Olympic Gold More Than Usain Bolt&nbsp;\u2013 Forbes |magazine=Forbes.com |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207040214/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/08/03/why-banksy-deserves-an-olympic-gold-more-than-usain-bolt/ |archivedate=7 February 2013 }}</ref> Although Banksy's works usually rely on visual imagery and iconography to put forth their message, Banksy has made several politically related comments in their various books.

He mentions in his book ''Wall and Piece'' that as he was starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number. He then devised a series of intricate stencils to minimise time and overlapping of the colour.\n\nThere exists a debate about the influence behind his work. Some critics claim Banksy was influenced by musician and graffiti artist [[Robert Del Naja|3D]]. Another source credits the artist's work to resemble that of French graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]]. It is said that Banksy was inspired by their use of stencils, later taking this visual style and transforming it through modern political and social pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/27050301|title=Road sign believed to be a Banksy has vanished|date=13 August 2018|website=BBC Newsround|access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBanksy's stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly.\n\nIn the broader art world, [[Stencil#Aerosol stencils|stencils]] are traditionally hand drawn or printed onto sheets of acetate or card, before being cut out by hand. This technique allows artists to paint quickly to protect their anonymity. There is dispute in the street art world over the legitimacy of stencils, with many artists criticising their use as \"cheating\".\n\nIn 2018, Banksy created a piece live, as it was being auctioned. The piece, titled, [[Love is in the Bin]], was originally the painting, [[Girl with Balloon]], before it was shredded at [[Sotheby's]]. While the bidding was going on, a shredder was activated from within the frame, and the piece was partially shredded, thus creating a new piece.\n\n== Political and social themes ==\n[[File:Shop Until You Drop by Banksy.JPG|thumb|right|''Shop Until You Drop'' in Mayfair, London. Banksy has said \"We can't do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles. In the meantime we should all go shopping to console ourselves.\"<ref>''Wall and Piece'', by Banksy, 2006, Century, {{ISBN|1-84413-787-2}}, pg 204</ref>]]\n{{Anti-consumerism |People}}\nBanksy once characterised graffiti as a form of underclass \"revenge\", or [[guerrilla warfare]] that allows an individual to snatch away power, territory and glory from a bigger and better equipped enemy.<ref name = \"HPBanksy\" /> Banksy sees a social class component to this [[class struggle|struggle]], remarking \"If you don't own a train company then you go and paint on one instead.\"<ref name = \"HPBanksy\" /> Banksy's work has also shown a desire to mock centralised power, hoping that their work will show the public that although power does exist and works against you, that power is not terribly efficient and it can and should be deceived.<ref name = \"HPBanksy\" />\n\nBanksy's works have dealt with various political and social themes, including [[anti-war]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-fascism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[nihilism]], and [[existentialism]]. Additionally, the components of the [[human condition]] that his works commonly critique are [[greed]], poverty, [[hypocrisy]], [[boredom]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], [[absurdity]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jonathon |last=Keats |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/08/03/why-banksy-deserves-an-olympic-gold-more-than-usain-bolt/ |title=Why Banksy Deserves An Olympic Gold More Than Usain Bolt&nbsp;\u2013 Forbes |magazine=Forbes.com |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207040214/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/08/03/why-banksy-deserves-an-olympic-gold-more-than-usain-bolt/ |archivedate=7 February 2013 }}</ref> Although Banksy's works usually rely on visual imagery and iconography to put forth their message, Banksy has made several politically related comments in their various books.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] until 1974 in [[Cheshire]], it is on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], along the west bank of the [[River Mersey]], opposite the city of [[Liverpool]].

In the 19th century, Birkenhead expanded greatly as a consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Birkenhead Park]] and [[Hamilton Square]] were laid out as well as the first street [[tram]]way in Britain. The [[Mersey Railway]] connected Birkenhead and Liverpool, with the world's first tunnel beneath a tidal estuary, and the [[shipbuilding]] firm [[Cammell Laird]] and a [[Great Float|seaport]] were established.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the town suffered a significant period of decline, with [[Containerization|containerisation]] causing a reduction in port activity. The [[Wirral Waters]] development is planned to regenerate much of the dockland.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name Birkenhead probably means \"headland overgrown with birch\", from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|bircen}} meaning [[birch]] tree,<ref>E. Ekwall, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 3rd edn., p.43</ref> of which many once grew on the headland which jutted into the river at [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] until 1974 in [[Cheshire]], it is on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], along the west bank of the [[River Mersey]], opposite the city of [[Liverpool]].

[[Birkenhead Park]] and [[Hamilton Square]] were laid out as well as the first street [[tram]]way in Britain. The [[Mersey Railway]] connected Birkenhead and Liverpool, with the world's first tunnel beneath a tidal estuary, and the [[shipbuilding]] firm [[Cammell Laird]] and a [[Great Float|seaport]] were established.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the town suffered a significant period of decline, with [[Containerization|containerisation]] causing a reduction in port activity.

At the [[Great Float|East Float]] and [[Vittoria Dock]], the development would include several 50-storey skyscrapers, {{convert|5000000|sqft|m2|-3}} of new office space and {{convert|11000000|sqft|m2}} for new residential flats. A retail and leisure quarter at the former [[Bidston Dock]] site would encompass another {{convert|571000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space.
