A [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) record of 1704 refers to it as Breete Strand Straat, while another calls it Breete Opgaande Straat no. I. In 1790 the matter was settled and name-boards with ''Strand Straat'' affixed to the corner houses.<ref name=\"Picard\" />\n\nFor two centuries Strand Street was home to the residences of citizens of the [[Cape Colony]].

The death of Johan Koopmans in 1880, sent Maria into an extended period of mourning, during which she travelled abroad, meeting [[King William III]] of the Netherlands.

The Municipal Council passed a similar motion on 7 November. Architect [[Herbert Baker]] wrote supportingly from Johannesburg, as did his partner, [[Frank Masey]], from [[Salisbury]].<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nThe wills of the De Wet sisters were ruled legally impossible to execute and the house (27 Strand Street, now no. 35), with all its content, was to be put up for auction. At the beginning of 1913 influential cultural figures [[Dora Fairbridge]], [[Edward Roworth]], [[William Frederick Purcell]], [[Major William Jardine]], [[Franklin Kaye Kendall]], and [[Fred Glennie]] were driving the campaign for government purchase of the Koopmans-de Wet Collection. [[Florence, Lady Phillips|Florence]] and her husband, the [[Randlord]] [[Lionel Phillips]], threw their considerable influence behind the movement from Johannesburg.\n\nUnder the patronage of Aletta Johanna, Lady de Villiers, wife of Chief Justice [[John Henry de Villiers]], a meeting was held in the [[Cape Town City Hall]] Library on 27 January 1913. Chaired by Annie Botha, wife of [[Louis Botha]], the meeting was attended by powerful personalities: [[Harry Hands]] (the Mayor), J. R. Finch (the Town Clerk), Sir [[James Rose-Innes]], Sir William Thorne, Sir [[Ernest Kilpin]], [[Olive Schreiner]], Dr. [[F.V. Engelenburg]], [[L. P\u00e9ringuey]] (Director of the South African Museum), [[Louis Mansergh]], Anna Purcell, Mrs. Marloth (wife of botanist [[Rudolph Marloth]]), Dora Fairbridge, Sir [[Johannes Hendricus Meiring Beck|Meiring Beck]] and Mrs. [[Beaumont Rawbone]].\n\nLionel Philipps moved that the house and contents be preserved for the nation and that General and Executive Committees be formed to engage in fundraising and other necessary activities. He went so far as to propose the members, with Annie Botha and Dora Fairbridge to chair the committees. [[Florence, Lady Phillips|Florence Phillips]] was to serve on both. The Rev. [[A. I. Steytler]] seconded the motion in Dutch and the proposal was accepted unanimously.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nTo drum up publicity, [[Olga Racster]] began contributing a series of articles on the house and its contents to the [[Cape Times]]. Mayor Harry Hands sent letters appealing for donations to all municipalities throughout the Union. Most notably, Johannesburg refused.\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1913, Florence Phillips accompanied by Mrs. Grace Douglas Pennant, Mrs. Marloth, and Dr. Purcell, went with Lionel in a deputation to appeal to the Cape Town City Council itself.

Amid bitter political division, the House of Assembly united briefly behind a national issue and allocated \u00a33000 for the purchase of furniture.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nDr. Purcell, Mr. J. R. Finch, Mr. A. E. F. Gore and Florence Phillips were selected to choose the furniture and objects which were to be retained for the Collection. The painter [[Edward Roworth]], who was in 1941 to be made Director of the [[South African National Gallery]], assisted in the selection of the pictures. After inspecting 2089 lots, it was agreed to purchase 356. The General Committee designated Dr. Purcell to bid.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nThe sale, conducted by J. J. Hofmeyer & Son, started on 17 March 1913 and was to last ten days. The first eight days took place at the Good Hope Hall, Cape Town; the last two at the house in Strand Street. Viewing only started on 15 March, and viewers were not allowed to touch any of the pieces. A sparse catalogue and less than ideal viewing conditions put the Committee, which had been able to inspect at their leisure, at a considerable advantage.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nThe sale was controversial. William R. Morrison, an Africana dealer and collector, wrote ten highly critical reports in the Cape Times, and on the evening of the first day the Government allocation of public funds came under heavy attack in the House and had to be defended by Lionel Philips and [[Abraham Fischer]].<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nOvervaluations abounded: a [[brass]] flower-bowl sold for \u00a38 5s, prompting Morrison to quip that brass is counted among the [[precious metals]] in Cape Town. Another brass bowl sold for \u00a39 10s. Bargains included a [[Louis XVI]] [[ormolu]] box, with [[mother of pearl]] lid, and inlaid enamel, by Vervain, sold for 26 shillings. A [[Louis XV]] silver [[cruet]], with cut glass bottles and castors sold for \u00a330.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nDr. Purcell was able to make his allotted purchases. He secured 374 lots, which he estimated to be 21% of the total. There were 69 pieces of furniture, 39 works of copper and brass, 28 pieces of [[Sheffield plate]], 41 silver items, 110 pieces of glass and 196 ceramic articles. The Sheffield plate included the [[Breda service]] consisting of 3 branched [[candelabra]], 5 [[entr\u00e9e]] dishes, 4 covered dishes and 2 sauce-[[tureens]]. It was bought in London in the 1834 for [[Michel van Breda]] of Oranjezicht, with slave emancipation money. It set the Committee back \u00a3500 10s.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nThe most important silver items were Dutch, of which an engraved ''[[konvoor]]'' and kettle were notable.<ref name=\"Woodward\" /> Among the glass was a tumbler, engraved with a portrait of Louis XVI, presented by him to a member of the [[de Lettre]] family.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nA total of \u00a34032 was realised.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nThe Koopmans-de Wet House would be auctioned on 8 April 1913. Lionel Phillips and his committee met in the night of 7 April, to formally resolve to buy the house and then hand it over to the South African Museum. The next day the public Committee bought the house for \u00a32800 and formally donated it, along with Dr. Purcell's purchases, to the State.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" /><ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\n===The fate of the library===\nDr. Purcell was not the only successful bidder in 1913. William R. Morrison was asked by the Kimberley Library to purchase a number of rare South African books. The Kimberley Public Library Annual Report, submitted at the Annual General Meeting held on 4 March 1914 records that he was \"successful in securing at very modest prices a considerable number of excessively rare books for our African collection\".

[[Lady Charlotte Guest]], herself a knowledgeable collector of ceramics, visited Marie and Margaretha at home on 10 December 1883 and wrote in her journal of \"a great deal of good china\".<ref name=Schreiber>{{cite book|last=Schreiber|first=Charlotte|title=Lady Charlotte Schreiber's Journals|year=1911|publisher=Johan Lane, the Bodley Head|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/ladycharlottesch02schruoft}}</ref>\n\nThe sale of 1913 included 147 pieces of [[Chinese porcelain]], 20 of [[Japanese porcelain]] and 29 of Delft and other earthenware. Purcell noted 142 pieces of blue-and-white Chinese porcelain of a type exported in quantity from China.\n\n[[Nanjing|Nankin]] porcelain came to the Cape in large quantities and Marie Koopmans-de Wet was a collector. She owned an intact Nankin service, still on display at Koopmans-de Wet House.<ref name=\"Woodward\"/> The sale of 1913 contained 43 lots of Nankin, fetching over \u00a388.<ref name=\"Woodward\" /> Purcell acquired so many that Morrison was to decry the purchases as ''Kitchen Nankin'' on the 7th day of sale.<ref name=\"Woodward\" /> For whatever reason, Purcell chose to purchase ceramics typical of the prosperous town house of the early nineteenth century Cape, and not necessarily of the original collection.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nOne ceramic piece of major importance was bought in 1913 for \u00a353. It is a bottle shaped vase, enamelled in ''[[famille rose]]'' with sprays of fruiting peach, bearing the [[Qianlong Emperor|Ch'ien Lung]] seal mark and of the period.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\n==First restorations (1913\u20131914)==\n[[File:Koopmans-de Wet House.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Koopmans-de Wet House in 1920]]\nRestorations were led by Dr. Purcell, a zoologist and biologist, who brought a scientific rigour to the process, documenting every stage meticulously.\n\nHaving stripped the plaster from the exterior walls, to expose the bricks, Purcell was able to conclude that the house was built in different stages between 1701 and 1793.<ref name=\"Picard\" /> The Smedinga dwelling would have been one of no more than 150 houses in the Cape Colony. It would have had a low pitched roof thatched with [[Elegia tectorum]] (Cape Thatching Reed or Dekriet), the typical examples described by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] being of brick and [[Whitewash|white-washed]].<ref name=\"Thunberg\" />\n\nFire being a constant danger, thatched roofs were ordered raised to at least 8&nbsp;ft. above the ground in 1698. Due to this hazard, along with the wind, flat-roofed dwellings became fashionable at the Cape. The first flat-roofed house in the Cape was erected in 1732; whale oil was used to prevent it from leaking.<ref name=\"Picard\" />\n\nPurcell found lime-concrete on the roof, which would have been quarried on [[Robben Island]].<ref name=Thunberg>{{cite book|last=Thunberg|first=Carl Peter|title=Travels at the Cape of Good Hope 1772\u20131775|year=1986|publisher=Van Riebeeck Society|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-0-620-10981-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ocliNOUc20oC&vq=robben+island}}</ref> The lime was replaced with boards and [[bitumen]]. A number of recent structural additions were also removed.<ref name=\"Iziko\" />\n\nDr. Purcell discovered extensive murals, but was unable to pursue their restoration due to lack of funds. Indeed, funds had been completely depleted by the opening on 10 March 1914, and the Mayor John Parker was moved to appeal for more.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" /> Further work would not be done until 1979.<ref name=\"Iziko\" />\n\nWhen Purcell died on 3 October 1919, Florence Phillips contributed \u00a310 toward a memorial tablet, designed by architect [[Joseph Michael Solomon]], with a likeness in bas-relief modelled by [[Moses Kottler]].

He went so far as to propose the members, with Annie Botha and Dora Fairbridge to chair the committees. [[Florence, Lady Phillips|Florence Phillips]] was to serve on both. The Rev. [[A. I.

The painter [[Edward Roworth]], who was in 1941 to be made Director of the [[South African National Gallery]], assisted in the selection of the pictures. After inspecting 2089 lots, it was agreed to purchase 356. The General Committee designated Dr. Purcell to bid.<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nThe sale, conducted by J. J. Hofmeyer & Son, started on 17 March 1913 and was to last ten days. The first eight days took place at the Good Hope Hall, Cape Town; the last two at the house in Strand Street. Viewing only started on 15 March, and viewers were not allowed to touch any of the pieces. A sparse catalogue and less than ideal viewing conditions put the Committee, which had been able to inspect at their leisure, at a considerable advantage.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nThe sale was controversial. William R. Morrison, an Africana dealer and collector, wrote ten highly critical reports in the Cape Times, and on the evening of the first day the Government allocation of public funds came under heavy attack in the House and had to be defended by Lionel Philips and [[Abraham Fischer]].<ref name=\"Gutsche\" />\n\nOvervaluations abounded: a [[brass]] flower-bowl sold for \u00a38 5s, prompting Morrison to quip that brass is counted among the [[precious metals]] in Cape Town. Another brass bowl sold for \u00a39 10s. Bargains included a [[Louis XVI]] [[ormolu]] box, with [[mother of pearl]] lid, and inlaid enamel, by Vervain, sold for 26 shillings. A [[Louis XV]] silver [[cruet]], with cut glass bottles and castors sold for \u00a330.<ref name=\"Woodward\" />\n\nDr. Purcell was able to make his allotted purchases.

There were 69 pieces of furniture, 39 works of copper and brass, 28 pieces of [[Sheffield plate]], 41 silver items, 110 pieces of glass and 196 ceramic articles. The Sheffield plate included the [[Breda service]] consisting of 3 branched [[candelabra]], 5 [[entr\u00e9e]] dishes, 4 covered dishes and 2 sauce-[[tureens]].

Due to this hazard, along with the wind, flat-roofed dwellings became fashionable at the Cape. The first flat-roofed house in the Cape was erected in 1732; whale oil was used to prevent it from leaking.<ref name=\"Picard\" />\n\nPurcell found lime-concrete on the roof, which would have been quarried on [[Robben Island]].<ref name=Thunberg>{{cite book|last=Thunberg|first=Carl Peter|title=Travels at the Cape of Good Hope 1772\u20131775|year=1986|publisher=Van Riebeeck Society|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-0-620-10981-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ocliNOUc20oC&vq=robben+island}}</ref> The lime was replaced with boards and [[bitumen]]. A number of recent structural additions were also removed.<ref name=\"Iziko\" />\n\nDr. Purcell discovered extensive murals, but was unable to pursue their restoration due to lack of funds.

The PAC-Card contains a checklist of essential support questions, for patients to use in any interaction with a health professional. The PAC-Card was tested in a medical trial at [[OLVG]] (a large Amsterdam Hospital) by Jeanet Rooseman, Vanessa Scholtes and Dr. R. W. Poolman assessing the effectiveness of the PAC-Card, the following was concluded: ''\u2018The primary analysis with regard to patient satisfaction in patient-caregiver communication showed that the PAC-Card had a positive impact on two aspects of patient satisfaction in the intervention group. Patient satisfaction regarding quality of care and the way of communication improved significantly in the intervention group. To support patients in a more structured way of communicating the PAC-Card is recommended to be used by patients. It helps patients communicate more effectively and patients are more satisfied with the quality of care and communication.\u2019'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.compriz.nl/nieuws/165 |title=Compriz, PAC-kaart helpt pati\u00ebnt \u00e9n arts bij goed gesprek |access-date=2015-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626201445/http://www.compriz.nl/nieuws/165 |archive-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.netwerkpalliatievezorg.nl/zeeland/Pati%C3%ABntenennaasten/Nieuws/tabid/9791/ctl/Details/ArticleID/11384/mid/20726/Zo-praat-je-met-je-arts.aspx Netwerk Palliatieve Zorg Zeeland, Zo praat je met je arts]</ref><ref>[http://www.jeroenboschziekenhuis.nl/Publicaties/101943/Afspraak-\u2010op-\u2010de-\u2010polikliniek-\u2010Voorbereiden-\u2010op-\u2010de-\u2010afspraak Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis]</ref><ref>[http://www.rathenau.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/2014/05/dialoogzorg-twee-minuten-aandacht-voor-de-patient-maakt-een-wereld-van-verschil.html Dialoogzorg, twee minuten aandacht voor het verhaal van de pati\u00ebnt]</ref>\n\n== The Patient's Guide ==\nIn order to facilitate the use of the PAC-Card in 2014 Gordon published ''The Patient\u2019s Guide - Think.

The PAC-Card contains a checklist of essential support questions, for patients to use in any interaction with a health professional. The PAC-Card was tested in a medical trial at [[OLVG]] (a large Amsterdam Hospital) by Jeanet Rooseman, Vanessa Scholtes and Dr. R. W. Poolman assessing the effectiveness of the PAC-Card, the following was concluded: ''\u2018The primary analysis with regard to patient satisfaction in patient-caregiver communication showed that the PAC-Card had a positive impact on two aspects of patient satisfaction in the intervention group. Patient satisfaction regarding quality of care and the way of communication improved significantly in the intervention group. To support patients in a more structured way of communicating the PAC-Card is recommended to be used by patients. It helps patients communicate more effectively and patients are more satisfied with the quality of care and communication.\u2019'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.compriz.nl/nieuws/165 |title=Compriz, PAC-kaart helpt pati\u00ebnt \u00e9n arts bij goed gesprek |access-date=2015-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626201445/http://www.compriz.nl/nieuws/165 |archive-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.netwerkpalliatievezorg.nl/zeeland/Pati%C3%ABntenennaasten/Nieuws/tabid/9791/ctl/Details/ArticleID/11384/mid/20726/Zo-praat-je-met-je-arts.aspx Netwerk Palliatieve Zorg Zeeland, Zo praat je met je arts]</ref><ref>[http://www.jeroenboschziekenhuis.nl/Publicaties/101943/Afspraak-\u2010op-\u2010de-\u2010polikliniek-\u2010Voorbereiden-\u2010op-\u2010de-\u2010afspraak Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis]</ref><ref>[http://www.rathenau.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/2014/05/dialoogzorg-twee-minuten-aandacht-voor-de-patient-maakt-een-wereld-van-verschil.html Dialoogzorg, twee minuten aandacht voor het verhaal van de pati\u00ebnt]</ref>\n\n== The Patient's Guide ==\nIn order to facilitate the use of the PAC-Card in 2014 Gordon published ''The Patient\u2019s Guide - Think.

Seleucus was one of the [[Diadochi]] successors of [[Alexander the Great]] who, after Alexander's death, divided his empire among themselves. Although Seleucus soon moved his main capital to [[Antioch]], in northern [[Syria]], Seleucia became an important center of trade, Hellenistic culture, and regional government under the Seleucids. The city was populated by Greeks, Syrians and Jews.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Seleucia |volume=24 |page=603}}</ref>. To make his capital into a metropolis, Seleukos I forced almost all inhabitants of Babylon, except the local temple priests/supporting workers, to leave and resettle in Seleucia. \" A tablet dated 275 BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia, where a palace and a temple (Esagila) were built.\"<ref>See entry for Babylon</ref> Standing at the confluence of the Tigris River with a major canal from the [[Euphrates]], Seleucia was placed to receive traffic from both great waterways. During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, it was one of the great [[Hellenistic]] cities, comparable to [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], and greater than Syrian Antioch. Excavations indicate that the walls of the city enclosed an area of at least {{convert|550|ha}}. Based on this size, the population has been estimated to number over 100,000 initially and probably more later. Its surrounding region might have supported half a million people.<ref name= aper/>\n\nPolybius (5,52ff) uses the Macedonian ''[[peliganes]]'' for the council of Seleucia, which implies a Macedonian colony, consistent with its rise to prominence under Seleucus I; Pausanias ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.16.3 1,16]) records that Seleucus also settled [[Babylon]]ians there. Archaeological finds support the presence of a large population not of Greek culture. In 141&nbsp;BC, the Parthians under [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] conquered the city, and Seleucia became the western capital of the [[Parthian Empire]]. [[Tacitus]] described its walls, and mentioned that it was, even under Parthian rule, a fully Hellenistic city. Ancient texts claim that the city had 600,000 inhabitants, and was ruled by a senate of 300 people. It was clearly one of the largest cities in the Western world; only Rome, [[Alexandria]] and possibly [[Antioch]] were more populous.\n\nIn 55&nbsp;BC, a battle fought near Seleucia was crucial in establishing dynastic succession of the [[Arsacid]] kings. In this battle between the reigning [[Mithridates III of Parthia|Mithridates III]] (supported by a Roman army of [[Aulus Gabinius]], governor of Syria) and the previously deposed [[Orodes II]], the reigning monarch was defeated, allowing Orodes to re-establish himself as king. In 41&nbsp;BC, Seleucia was the scene of a massacre of around 5,000 Babylonian Jewish refugees ([[Josephus]], ''Ant.'' xviii. 9, \u00a7 9).[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=451&letter=S]\n\nIn 117&nbsp;AD, Seleucia was burned down by the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] during his conquest of Mesopotamia, but the following year it was ceded back to the Parthians by Trajan's successor, [[Hadrian]], then rebuilt in the [[Parthian style]]. It was completely destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Avidius Cassius]] in 165.<ref>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter8.html#fn8.37 ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', by Edward Gibbon]</ref>\n\n===Sasanian rule===\nOver sixty years later a new city, ''[[Veh-Ardashir]]'', was built across the river by [[Persia]]n emperor [[Ardashir I]]. This new city was long believed to be located at Seleucia but was shown by Italian excavations to be a fresh construction separate from Seleucia and Ctesiphon. There were active [[Christianity|Christian]] churches in Mesopotamia from the 1st century onwards and in the 3rd or 4th century Seleucia became an important centre.\n[[File:Babylon&Seleuicia1(Peutinger Map).png |thumb|left|Seleucia in the 4th century on the [[Peutinger Map]].]]\nFollowing the edict of toleration by the Persian Sassanian King [[Yazdegerd I]], which for the time being brought an end to the [[persecution of Christians]], which had lasted for 70&nbsp;years, the remaining Christians set about reorganizing and strengthening the church.\n\nThe [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] (The Synod of Mar Isaac) met in 410&nbsp;AD under the presidency of [[Mar Isaac (bishop)|Mar Isaac]], the [[bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]]. The most important decision of the [[Synod]] which had a very far reaching effect on the life of the church, was to declare the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] as the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Church of the East]]; and in recognition of this pre-eminence he was given the title \u2018[[Catholicos]]\u2019. The Synod confirmed Mar Isaac as Catholicos and Archbishop of all the Orient. The Synod also declared its adherence to the decision of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] and subscribed to the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Canons of the Synod leave no doubt as to the authority of the great Metropolitan, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Without his approval, no election of bishop would be valid.<!---Ultimately the synods must be moved to their own articles. Too much about religion and not enough about Seleucia. Leave one or two line summary here--->\n\nTowards the end of the reign of Yazdegerd I, the [[Christians]] were again persecuted in AD 420. Dadyeshu was elected Catholicos in AD 421 and himself suffered during the persecution and was imprisoned. When he was released he resigned and left Seleucia, but the church refused to accept the resignation and there followed the [[Synod of Dadyeshu]] which met in AD 424 in Markabata of the Arabs under the presidency of Mar Dadyeshu. It proved to be one of the most significant of all Persian synods. The first synod of Isaac in AD 410 had decided that the Catholicos of Seleucia [[Ctesiphon]] be supreme among the bishops of the East. The Synod of Dadyeshu decided that the Catholicos should be the sole head of the Church of the East and that no ecclesiastical authority should be acknowledged above him. For the first time, this synod referred to the Catholicos as Patriarch and that their Catholicos was answerable to God alone. This had some effect in reassuring the Sasanian monarchy that the Persian Christians were not influenced by the Roman enemy.\n\nThe city eventually faded into obscurity and was swallowed by the desert sands, probably abandoned after the Tigris shifted its course.\n<!----Definitely needs to be moved out to its own article. Okay to \"store\" here but please move this soon. Inappropriate for Seleucia per se.\n[[Roman Catholic]]s have viewed this as a schism, but that is an irrational interpretation.{{fact|date=November 2010}} One cause of the persecution had been that Christians were seen by the Persian monarchy as too friendly with Rome. This was a declaration of brotherly equality of the Partiarch of Seleucia with Antioch and Rome without doctrinal or other division or hostility, and a reassurance to the Persian rulers that the Christians of Mesopotamia and Persia suffered no political influence from the hostile Roman Empire\n\n----move the above to its own article--->\n[[File:Karte Seleucia Ktesiphon.png|thumb|right|Archeological map of Seleucia and [[Ctesiphon]] sites]]\n\n== Archaeology ==\nThe site of Seleucia was rediscovered in the 1920s by archaeologists looking for [[Opis]].<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html University of Michigan.edu]</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1927, [[University of Michigan]] professors [[Leroy Waterman]] (1927\u20131932) and Clark Hopkins (1936\u20131937) oversaw excavations for the [[Kelsey Museum of Archaeology]] on behalf of the American School of Oriental Research of Baghdad with funds supplied by the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] and the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].\n<ref>L.

Seleucus was one of the [[Diadochi]] successors of [[Alexander the Great]] who, after Alexander's death, divided his empire among themselves. Although Seleucus soon moved his main capital to [[Antioch]], in northern [[Syria]], Seleucia became an important center of trade, Hellenistic culture, and regional government under the Seleucids. The city was populated by Greeks, Syrians and Jews.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Seleucia |volume=24 |page=603}}</ref>. To make his capital quickly a a metropolis, Seleukos I forced almost all inhabitants of Babylon, except the local temple priests/supporting workers, to leave and resettle in Seleucia. \" A tablet dated 275 BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia, where a palace and a temple (Esagila) were built.\"<ref>See entry for Babylon</ref> Standing at the confluence of the Tigris River with a major canal from the [[Euphrates]], Seleucia was placed to receive traffic from both great waterways. During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, it was one of the great [[Hellenistic]] cities, comparable to [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], and greater than Syrian Antioch. Excavations indicate that the walls of the city enclosed an area of at least {{convert|550|ha}}. Based on this size, the population has been estimated to number over 100,000 initially and probably more later. Its surrounding region might have supported half a million people.<ref name= aper/>\n\nPolybius (5,52ff) uses the Macedonian ''[[peliganes]]'' for the council of Seleucia, which implies a Macedonian colony, consistent with its rise to prominence under Seleucus I; Pausanias ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.16.3 1,16]) records that Seleucus also settled [[Babylon]]ians there. Archaeological finds support the presence of a large population not of Greek culture. In 141&nbsp;BC, the Parthians under [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] conquered the city, and Seleucia became the western capital of the [[Parthian Empire]]. [[Tacitus]] described its walls, and mentioned that it was, even under Parthian rule, a fully Hellenistic city. Ancient texts claim that the city had 600,000 inhabitants, and was ruled by a senate of 300 people. It was clearly one of the largest cities in the Western world; only Rome, [[Alexandria]] and possibly [[Antioch]] were more populous.\n\nIn 55&nbsp;BC, a battle fought near Seleucia was crucial in establishing dynastic succession of the [[Arsacid]] kings. In this battle between the reigning [[Mithridates III of Parthia|Mithridates III]] (supported by a Roman army of [[Aulus Gabinius]], governor of Syria) and the previously deposed [[Orodes II]], the reigning monarch was defeated, allowing Orodes to re-establish himself as king. In 41&nbsp;BC, Seleucia was the scene of a massacre of around 5,000 Babylonian Jewish refugees ([[Josephus]], ''Ant.'' xviii. 9, \u00a7 9).[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=451&letter=S]\n\nIn 117&nbsp;AD, Seleucia was burned down by the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] during his conquest of Mesopotamia, but the following year it was ceded back to the Parthians by Trajan's successor, [[Hadrian]], then rebuilt in the [[Parthian style]]. It was completely destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Avidius Cassius]] in 165.<ref>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter8.html#fn8.37 ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', by Edward Gibbon]</ref>\n\n===Sasanian rule===\nOver sixty years later a new city, ''[[Veh-Ardashir]]'', was built across the river by [[Persia]]n emperor [[Ardashir I]]. This new city was long believed to be located at Seleucia but was shown by Italian excavations to be a fresh construction separate from Seleucia and Ctesiphon. There were active [[Christianity|Christian]] churches in Mesopotamia from the 1st century onwards and in the 3rd or 4th century Seleucia became an important centre.\n[[File:Babylon&Seleuicia1(Peutinger Map).png |thumb|left|Seleucia in the 4th century on the [[Peutinger Map]].]]\nFollowing the edict of toleration by the Persian Sassanian King [[Yazdegerd I]], which for the time being brought an end to the [[persecution of Christians]], which had lasted for 70&nbsp;years, the remaining Christians set about reorganizing and strengthening the church.\n\nThe [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] (The Synod of Mar Isaac) met in 410&nbsp;AD under the presidency of [[Mar Isaac (bishop)|Mar Isaac]], the [[bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]]. The most important decision of the [[Synod]] which had a very far reaching effect on the life of the church, was to declare the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] as the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Church of the East]]; and in recognition of this pre-eminence he was given the title \u2018[[Catholicos]]\u2019. The Synod confirmed Mar Isaac as Catholicos and Archbishop of all the Orient. The Synod also declared its adherence to the decision of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] and subscribed to the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Canons of the Synod leave no doubt as to the authority of the great Metropolitan, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Without his approval, no election of bishop would be valid.<!---Ultimately the synods must be moved to their own articles. Too much about religion and not enough about Seleucia. Leave one or two line summary here--->\n\nTowards the end of the reign of Yazdegerd I, the [[Christians]] were again persecuted in AD 420. Dadyeshu was elected Catholicos in AD 421 and himself suffered during the persecution and was imprisoned. When he was released he resigned and left Seleucia, but the church refused to accept the resignation and there followed the [[Synod of Dadyeshu]] which met in AD 424 in Markabata of the Arabs under the presidency of Mar Dadyeshu. It proved to be one of the most significant of all Persian synods. The first synod of Isaac in AD 410 had decided that the Catholicos of Seleucia [[Ctesiphon]] be supreme among the bishops of the East. The Synod of Dadyeshu decided that the Catholicos should be the sole head of the Church of the East and that no ecclesiastical authority should be acknowledged above him. For the first time, this synod referred to the Catholicos as Patriarch and that their Catholicos was answerable to God alone. This had some effect in reassuring the Sasanian monarchy that the Persian Christians were not influenced by the Roman enemy.\n\nThe city eventually faded into obscurity and was swallowed by the desert sands, probably abandoned after the Tigris shifted its course.\n<!----Definitely needs to be moved out to its own article. Okay to \"store\" here but please move this soon. Inappropriate for Seleucia per se.\n[[Roman Catholic]]s have viewed this as a schism, but that is an irrational interpretation.{{fact|date=November 2010}} One cause of the persecution had been that Christians were seen by the Persian monarchy as too friendly with Rome. This was a declaration of brotherly equality of the Partiarch of Seleucia with Antioch and Rome without doctrinal or other division or hostility, and a reassurance to the Persian rulers that the Christians of Mesopotamia and Persia suffered no political influence from the hostile Roman Empire\n\n----move the above to its own article--->\n[[File:Karte Seleucia Ktesiphon.png|thumb|right|Archeological map of Seleucia and [[Ctesiphon]] sites]]\n\n== Archaeology ==\nThe site of Seleucia was rediscovered in the 1920s by archaeologists looking for [[Opis]].<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html University of Michigan.edu]</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1927, [[University of Michigan]] professors [[Leroy Waterman]] (1927\u20131932) and Clark Hopkins (1936\u20131937) oversaw excavations for the [[Kelsey Museum of Archaeology]] on behalf of the American School of Oriental Research of Baghdad with funds supplied by the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] and the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].\n<ref>L.

Clark went to a preparatory boarding school in Buckinghamshire at age 6 1/2, from where he moved on to [[Monkton Combe School]] near Bath. Clark graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], under [[Miles Burkitt]] and [[Grahame Clark]].<ref name=\"senate.universityofcalifornia.edu\">{{cite web|title=In Memoriam|accessdate=7 November 2019|url=http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/JohnDesmondClark.htm|publisher=University of California}}</ref>\n\n==Archeological and anthropological career==\nIn 1937 Clark became the curator of [[Northern Rhodesia]]'s [[Livingstone Museum|Rhodes-Livingstone Museum]] (now known as the Livingstone Memorial Museum). A year later he married Betty Cable n\u00e9e Baume, who would accompany him on a number of expeditions throughout his life.

Following the war, he returned to Cambridge, completing his PhD in 1947. In 1948 he founded the Northern Rhodesian National Monuments Commission.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nClark then returned to Northern Rhodesia to serve once more as the Museum's director. In 1953, Clark ordered an excavation at [[Kalambo Falls]], a 235m high, single-drop waterfall at the southeast end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], on what is now the border between Zambia and Tanzania. The site would eventually emerge as one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century, providing a record of more than two hundred and fifty thousand years of human history. To date, artefacts of [[Acheulean]], [[Sangoan]], [[Lupemban]], [[Magosian]], [[Wilton culture|Wilton]], and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] cultures have all been found at the falls. Clark also undertook significant fieldwork in Ethiopia, Somalia, Malawi, Angola, and Niger, some of which led him to collaborate with [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]].\n\nIn 1961, Clark resigned from his post as Director of the Museum (being succeeded by Gervas C.R. Clay<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/GervasClay|title=Gervas (Charles Robert) Clay|website=Spanglefish.com|accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>), and became Professor of [[Anthropology]] (subsequently Emeritus) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught until his retirement in 1986. Under his guidance, the programme became one of the world's foremost in [[paleoanthropology]]. In 1965, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|p=102}}</ref> He received the [[Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America|Gold Medal Award]] for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 1988 from the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. Clark continued working until his death, including a 1991 dig in China that was the first to be led in that country by foreign archaeologists in more than 40 years. Clark died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 2002, having published more than twenty books and over 300 scholarly papers on paleoanthropology and African prehistory in the course of his career. His wife survived him by only two months. He is survived by his children, Elizabeth and John.\n\nOver the course of his career, Clark compiled a large scholarly library of scientific books and articles which he donated to his former students, archaeologists [[Nicholas Toth]] and [[Kathy Schick]], at the [[Stone Age Institute]] where the collection is now housed as the Desmond Clark Memorial Library.\n\n==Honours==\nClark was appointed [[OBE]] in 1956 and [[CBE]] in 1960. He was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries|FSA]] in 1952 and [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] in 1961. He was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and of the [[National Academy of Science]] (USA). His Cambridge ScD was awarded in 1975 and honorary doctorates at Witwatersrand and Cape Town universities in 1985, along with the Gold Medals of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] of London (1985) and the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (1989).

Desmond Clark''', 10 April 1916 \u2013 14 February 2002) was a British [[archaeology|archaeologist]] noted particularly for his work on prehistoric Africa.\n\n==Early life==\nClark was born in London, but his childhood was spent in a hamlet in the [[Chiltern Hills]] of [[Buckinghamshire]]. Clark went to a preparatory boarding school in Buckinghamshire at age 6 1/2, from where he moved on to [[Monkton Combe School]] near Bath. Clark graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], under [[Miles Burkitt]] and [[Grahame Clark]].<ref name=\"senate.universityofcalifornia.edu\">{{cite web|title=In Memoriam|accessdate=7 November 2019|url=http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/JohnDesmondClark.htm|publisher=University of California}}</ref>\n\n==Archeological and anthropological career==\nIn 1937 Clark became the curator of [[Northern Rhodesia]]'s [[Livingstone Museum|Rhodes-Livingstone Museum]] (now known as the Livingstone Memorial Museum). A year later he married Betty Cable n\u00e9e Baume, who would accompany him on a number of expeditions throughout his life. Clark served in the military during [[World War II]] with the East Africa Command forces in Somalia and Ethiopia, being subsequently attached to the British Military Administration,<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-j-desmond-clark-9175292.html|title=Professor J. Desmond Clark|work=[[The Independent]]|date=22 February 2002|accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref> when he managed to find time to carry out archaeological fieldwork in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Following the war, he returned to Cambridge, completing his PhD in 1947. In 1948 he founded the Northern Rhodesian National Monuments Commission.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nClark then returned to Northern Rhodesia to serve once more as the Museum's director. In 1953, Clark ordered an excavation at [[Kalambo Falls]], a 235m high, single-drop waterfall at the southeast end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], on what is now the border between Zambia and Tanzania. The site would eventually emerge as one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century, providing a record of more than two hundred and fifty thousand years of human history. To date, artefacts of [[Acheulean]], [[Sangoan]], [[Lupemban]], [[Magosian]], [[Wilton culture|Wilton]], and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] cultures have all been found at the falls. Clark also undertook significant fieldwork in Ethiopia, Somalia, Malawi, Angola, and Niger, some of which led him to collaborate with [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]].\n\nIn 1961, Clark resigned from his post as Director of the Museum (being succeeded by Gervas C.R. Clay<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/GervasClay|title=Gervas (Charles Robert) Clay|website=Spanglefish.com|accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>), and became Professor of [[Anthropology]] (subsequently Emeritus) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught until his retirement in 1986. Under his guidance, the programme became one of the world's foremost in [[paleoanthropology]]. In 1965, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|p=102}}</ref> He received the [[Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America|Gold Medal Award]] for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 1988 from the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. Clark continued working until his death, including a 1991 dig in China that was the first to be led in that country by foreign archaeologists in more than 40 years. Clark died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 2002, having published more than twenty books and over 300 scholarly papers on paleoanthropology and African prehistory in the course of his career. His wife survived him by only two months. He is survived by his children, Elizabeth and John.\n\nOver the course of his career, Clark compiled a large scholarly library of scientific books and articles which he donated to his former students, archaeologists [[Nicholas Toth]] and [[Kathy Schick]], at the [[Stone Age Institute]] where the collection is now housed as the Desmond Clark Memorial Library.\n\n==Honours==\nClark was appointed [[OBE]] in 1956 and [[CBE]] in 1960. He was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries|FSA]] in 1952 and [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] in 1961. He was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and of the [[National Academy of Science]] (USA). His Cambridge ScD was awarded in 1975 and honorary doctorates at Witwatersrand and Cape Town universities in 1985, along with the Gold Medals of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] of London (1985) and the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (1989). The [[British Academy]] awarded him the [[Grahame Clark Medal for Prehistory]] in 1997. He became an American citizen in 1993.\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite book|author=Clark, J.
