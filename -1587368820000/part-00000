It is the most populous municipality labelled as a \u2033town\" in Florida, and the fourth most populous such community in the United States, trailing only [[Hempstead, New York]]; [[Gilbert, Arizona]]; and [[Cary, North Carolina]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Robert Parsell Davie 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|R.P. Davie]]\nDavie was founded by Tamara Toussaint and Jake Tannebaum. The original name of the town was '''Zona'''. In 1909, R.P. Davie assisted then [[Florida Governor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] by draining  [[swampland]]s. Robert Parsell (R.P.) Davie, a developer, bought about {{convert|27000|acre|km2|0}} in the area. He built a school in Zona. In 1916, the people of the town were so grateful they renamed the town after him. It was carved out of [[Everglades]] land that was mostly underwater.\n\nDavie has always had a reputation as a \"[[Wild West|Western]]\" town, with many earlier buildings having \"[[Wild West]]\" architecture. It boasts a significant horse-owning population and once was home to many herds of cattle. In recent years, commercial and residential development has discouraged such practices, but Davie still tries to maintain a \"[[American Old West|Western]]\" feel. [[Pioneer City]], a western theme park, was located across the street from [[Flamingo Gardens]]. It was built in the 1960s and closed a few years later.\n[[File:Hurricane damage to mobile home in Davie Florida.jpg|thumb|left|Damage by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 in Davie]]\n\n===The Old Davie School===\n\nThe Davie School, designed in 1917 by [[August Geiger (architect)|August Geiger]], one of South Florida's most prominent early architects, opened its doors in 1918 with about 90 students. The Davie School was the first permanent school in the Everglades and is now Broward County's oldest existing school building. The building was in continuous use as a school until 1980.  The Davie School Foundation was established in 1984 to protect and restore the Davie School to the integrity of its earlier appearance. The Foundation in conjunction with the Town of Davie, the Broward County School Board, the Soroptimists International of Davie, the Davie Historical Society and the community at large has worked tirelessly to preserve this important piece of Broward County's history The building is now referred to as the \"Old Davie School,\" and is maintained by a collaboration of the [http://www.olddavieschool.org/ Davie School Foundation] and the [http://www.davie-fl.gov Town of Davie].\n\nIn the early 2000s two other historic buildings from the surrounding neighborhood were moved to the property adjoining the Old Davie School.  \n* The Viele House, built beginning in 1912, is the oldest residential structure remaining in Davie and is an excellent example of vernacular architecture. It survived the hurricane of 1926 and the floods of 1947.  It was continuously occupied by members of the Viele family until being moved to the Old Davie School property.  Regrettably, the Viele House was sealed to accommodate a modern air conditioning system, as part of the permanent preservation plan.  One of the most important features of the original structure was the non-electric \"air conditioned\" design of the home.  Specifically, warm air was drawn up and out through the opening in the top of the attic.  The natural air flow kept the home relatively comfortable, even in the hot south Florida climate.  Also, as with most of the old Davie homes, the Viele House was elevated on pillars, which permitted the breeze to blow under the building.\n* In 2004 the former home of Colonel Charles A. & Katherine M. Walsh (1912\u20131932) and the Bud & Betty Osterhoudt family (1958\u20132004) was also moved to the site.\n\n===Jewish Davie===\nIn the 1970s Davie had the reputation of not being hospitable to Jews. Davie was rumored to be the seat of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in South Florida; a cross was burned on the front lawn of a new Jewish family in 1977. This provoked an outpouring of community support which persuaded the family to remain, insisting that \"never would they see anti-Semitism like that again.\" As of 2016, Davie has a thriving Jewish community.  There are [[Chabad house]]s, and a K-12 Jewish day school.\n\n==Geography==\nDavie is located at {{Coord|26.081426|-80.280223|type:city_region:US-FL|format=dms}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|92.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|90.4|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|2.2|km2|order=flip}} (2.32%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5859\n|1980= 20500\n|1990= 47217\n|2000= 75720\n|2010= 91992\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106558\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Davie Demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Davie||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||91,922||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+21.5%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||2,636.8/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||80.1%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||56.8%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||8.0%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||29.1%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||4.6%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||3.1%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.8%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\nAs of 2010, there were 37,306 households, with 8.0% being vacant.

It is the most populous municipality labelled as a \u2033town\" in Florida, and the fourth most populous such community in the United States, trailing only [[Hempstead, New York]]; [[Gilbert, Arizona]]; and [[Cary, North Carolina]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Robert Parsell Davie 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|R.P. Davie]]\nDavie was founded by Tamara Toussaint and Jake Tannebaum. The original name of the town was '''Zona'''. In 1909, R.P. Davie assisted then [[Florida Governor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] by draining  [[swampland]]s. Robert Parsell (R.P.) Davie, a developer, bought about {{convert|27000|acre|km2|0}} in the area. He built a school in Zona. In 1916, the people of the town were so grateful they renamed the town after him. It was carved out of [[Everglades]] land that was mostly underwater.\n\nDavie has always had a reputation as a \"[[Wild West|Western]]\" town, with many earlier buildings having \"[[Wild West]]\" architecture. It boasts a significant horse-owning population and once was home to many herds of cattle. In recent years, commercial and residential development has discouraged such practices, but Davie still tries to maintain a \"[[American Old West|Western]]\" feel. [[Pioneer City]], a western theme park, was located across the street from [[Flamingo Gardens]]. It was built in the 1960s and closed a few years later.\n[[File:Hurricane damage to mobile home in Davie Florida.jpg|thumb|left|Damage by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 in Davie]]\n\n===The Old Davie School===\n\nThe Davie School, designed in 1917 by [[August Geiger (architect)|August Geiger]], one of South Florida's most prominent early architects, opened its doors in 1918 with about 90 students. The Davie School was the first permanent school in the Everglades and is now Broward County's oldest existing school building. The building was in continuous use as a school until 1980.  The Davie School Foundation was established in 1984 to protect and restore the Davie School to the integrity of its earlier appearance. The Foundation in conjunction with the Town of Davie, the Broward County School Board, the Soroptimists International of Davie, the Davie Historical Society and the community at large has worked tirelessly to preserve this important piece of Broward County's history The building is now referred to as the \"Old Davie School,\" and is maintained by a collaboration of the [http://www.olddavieschool.org/ Davie School Foundation] and the [http://www.davie-fl.gov Town of Davie].\n\nIn the early 2000s two other historic buildings from the surrounding neighborhood were moved to the property adjoining the Old Davie School.  \n* The Viele House, built beginning in 1912, is the oldest residential structure remaining in Davie and is an excellent example of vernacular architecture. It survived the hurricane of 1926 and the floods of 1947.  It was continuously occupied by members of the Viele family until being moved to the Old Davie School property.  Regrettably, the Viele House was sealed to accommodate a modern air conditioning system, as part of the permanent preservation plan.  One of the most important features of the original structure was the non-electric \"air conditioned\" design of the home.  Specifically, warm air was drawn up and out through the opening in the top of the attic.  The natural air flow kept the home relatively comfortable, even in the hot south Florida climate.  Also, as with most of the old Davie homes, the Viele House was elevated on pillars, which permitted the breeze to blow under the building.\n* In 2004 the former home of Colonel Charles A. & Katherine M. Walsh (1912\u20131932) and the Bud & Betty Osterhoudt family (1958\u20132004) was also moved to the site.\n\n===Jewish Davie===\nIn the 1970s Davie had the reputation of not being hospitable to Jews. Davie was rumored to be the seat of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in South Florida; a cross was burned on the front lawn of a new Jewish family in 1977. This provoked an outpouring of community support which persuaded the family to remain, insisting that \"never would they see anti-Semitism like that again.\" As of 2016, Davie has a thriving Jewish community.  There are [[Chabad house]]s, and a K-12 Jewish day school.\n\n==Geography==\nDavie is located at {{Coord|26.081426|-80.280223|type:city_region:US-FL|format=dms}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|92.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|90.4|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|2.2|km2|order=flip}} (2.32%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5859\n|1980= 20500\n|1990= 47217\n|2000= 75720\n|2010= 91992\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106558\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Davie Demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Davie||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||91,922||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+21.5%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||2,636.8/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||80.1%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||56.8%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||8.0%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||29.1%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||4.6%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||3.1%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.8%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\nAs of 2010, there were 37,306 households, with 8.0% being vacant.
