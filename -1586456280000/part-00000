One of the first major departures came with the addition of [[Generic programming|generics]] to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of [[Reification (computer science)|reification]] to provide \"first-class\" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]] performed at class-load time.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t.aspx\n | title = Generics (C# Programming Guide)\n | publisher = Microsoft| accessdate  = March 21, 2011}}</ref>\nFurthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]] extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of [[lambda expressions]], [[extension method]]s, and [[anonymous type]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx\n | title = LINQ: .NET Language-Integrated Query|author=Don Box and Anders Hejlsberg\n | publisher = Microsoft\n | date = February 2007\n | accessdate  = March 21, 2011}}</ref>  These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of [[boilerplate code]] that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blog.abodit.com/2010/04/why-functional-programming-is-better-linq-c-sharp-than-procedural-code/\n | title = Why functional programming and LINQ is often better than procedural code\n | last = Mercer\n | first = Ian\n | publisher = abodit.com\n | date = April 15, 2010\n | accessdate  = March 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nC# used to have a [[mascot]] called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg).

Java. In particular:\n\n* Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.\n* [[Curly brackets]] are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into [[namespaces]].\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]].\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\n==Distinguishing features==\n{{See also|Comparison of C Sharp and Java}}\nSome notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:\n\n===Portability===\nBy design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying [[Common Language Infrastructure]]&nbsp;(CLI).<ref>{{cite book|title=Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4 Six-in-One|year=2010|publisher=Wrox Press|isbn=978-0470499481}}</ref>  Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Theoretically, a C# compiler could generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or [[Fortran]].\n\n===Typing===\nC# supports strongly typed implicit variable declarations with the keyword <code>var</code>, and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword <code>new[]</code> followed by a collection initializer.\n\nC# supports a strict [[Boolean data type]], <code>bool</code>. Statements that take conditions, such as <code>while</code> and <code>if</code>, require an expression of a type that implements the <code>true</code> operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as <code>if (a)</code> require only that <code>a</code> is convertible to bool, allowing <code>a</code> to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this \"integer meaning true or false\" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly <code>bool</code> can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as <code>if (a = b)</code> (use of assignment <code>=</code> instead of equality <code>==</code>).\n\nC# is more [[Type safety|type safe]] than C++. The only [[implicit conversion]]s by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]], and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ [[copy constructor]]s and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.\n\nC# has explicit support for [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance and contravariance]] in generic types, unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.\n\n[[enumerated type|Enumeration]] members are placed in their own [[Scope (programming)|scope]].\n\nThe C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.\n\nLocal variables cannot [[Variable shadowing|shadow]] variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Classes do NOT *NEED* to go in a Namespace. Check the spec or try it out yourself before stating otherwise.-->\n\n===Metaprogramming===\n[[Metaprogramming]] via C# attributes is part of the language. Many of these attributes duplicate the functionality of GCC's and VisualC++'s platform-dependent preprocessor directives.\n\n===Methods and functions===\nA method in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a class property. As in other syntactically similar languages, such as C++ and [[ANSI C]], the signature of a method is a declaration comprising in order: any optional scope modifier keywords (such as <code>private</code>), the explicit specification of its return type (such as <code>int</code>, or the keyword <code>void</code> if no value is returned), the name of the method, and finally, a parenthesized sequence of comma-separated parameter specifications, each consisting of a parameter's type, its formal name and optionally, a default value to be used whenever none is provided. Certain specific kinds of methods, such as those that simply get or set a class property by return value or assignment, do not require a full signature, but in the general case, the definition of a class includes the full signature declaration of its methods.\n\nLike C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword <code>virtual</code> to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses.<ref>{{cite web|title=virtual (C# Reference)|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n''Extension methods'' in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to add methods to an object that they feel should exist on that object and its derivatives.\n\nThe type <code>dynamic</code> allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.\n\nC# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword <code>delegate</code>. Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++ ''signal'' and ''slot'', C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.\n\nC# offers Java-like <code>synchronized</code> method calls, via the attribute <code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]</code>, and has support for [[Mutual exclusion|mutually-exclusive locks]] via the keyword <code>lock</code>.\n\n===Property===\nC# provides [[property (programming)|properties]] as [[syntactic sugar]] for a common pattern in which a pair of methods, [[Mutator method|accessor (getter) and mutator (setter)]] encapsulate operations on a single [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] of a class. No redundant method signatures{{Definition needed|The term signature/signatures are used in several places, and without any definition or explanation it is difficult to understand the concepts explained unless you have prior detailed knowledge of how C# define the concept \"Signature\"|date=May 2019}} for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.\n\n===Namespace===\nA C# <code>namespace</code> provides the same level of code isolation as a Java <code>package</code> or a C++ {{C++|namespace}}, with very similar rules and features to a <code>package</code>. Namespaces can be imported with the \"using\" syntax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive|title=using directive - C# Reference|last=|first=|date=|website=Microsoft Docs|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Memory access===\nIn C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as ''unsafe'', and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a \"live\" object or have the well-defined [[Nullable type|null]] value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a \"dead\" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an 'unmanaged' value type that does not contain any references to garbage-collected objects, array, string, or a block of stack-allocated memory. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the <code>System.IntPtr</code> type, but it cannot dereference them.\n\nManaged memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of [[memory leak]]s by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed.\n\n===Exception===\n[[Checked exceptions]] are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html\n| title = The Trouble with Checked Exceptions\n| first1=Bill\n| last1=Venners\n| first2=Bruce\n| last2=Eckel\n| date = August 18, 2003\n| accessdate = March 30, 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===Polymorphism===\nUnlike [[C++]], C# does not support [[multiple inheritance]], although a class can implement any number of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]]. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, i. e. two methods with the same name and taking parameters of the same type in the same order, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and having that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.\n\nHowever, unlike [[Java (programming language)|Java]], C# supports [[operator overloading]]. Only the most commonly overloaded operators in C++ may be overloaded in C#.\n\n===Language Integrated Query (LINQ)===\nC# has the ability to utilize [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]] through the .NET Framework. A developer can query any <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> object, XML documents, an ADO.NET dataset, and a SQL database.<ref>X. D. Zhang et al., \"Research of the Database Access Technology Under.NET Framework\", Applied Mechanics and Materials, Vols. 644-650, pp. 3077-3080, 2014</ref> Using LINQ in C# brings advantages like [[Intelligent code completion|Intellisense]] support, strong filtering capabilities, type safety with compile error checking ability, and consistency for querying data over a variety of sources.<ref>Otey, M. (2006, 02). LINQ to the future. SQL Server Magazine, 8, 17-21. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214859896</ref>  There are several different language structures that can be utilized with C# with LINQ and they are query expressions, lambda expressions, anonymous types, implicitly typed variables, extension methods, and object initializers.<ref>Sheldon, W. (2010, 11). New features in LINQ. SQL Server Magazine, 12, 37-40. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/770609095</ref>\n\n===Functional programming===\nThough primarily an imperative language, C# 2.0 offered limited support for functional programming through [[first-class functions]] and closures in the form of anonymous delegates. C# 3.0 expanded support for functional programming with the introduction of a lightweight syntax for lambda expressions, extension methods (an affordance for modules), and a [[list comprehension]] syntax in the form of a \"query comprehension\" language. C# 7.0 adds features typically found in functional languages like tuples and pattern matching.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7|title=What's New in C# 7.0|last=|first=|date=|website=Microsoft Docs|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Common type system==\nC# has a ''unified type system''. This unified type system is called [[Common Type System]] (CTS).<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\">{{cite book| last = Archer| first = Tom| title = Inside C#| year = 2001| publisher = Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, Washington|isbn=0-7356-1288-9|chapter=Part 2, Chapter 4: The Type System}}</ref>\n\nA unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the {{C sharp|System.Object}} class. For example, every type inherits a {{C sharp|ToString()}} method.\n\n===Categories of data types===\nCTS separates data types into two categories:<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" />\n\n#  Reference types\n#  Value types\n\nInstances of value types do not have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics - equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from {{C sharp|System.ValueType}}, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor. Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as {{C sharp|int}} (a signed 32-bit integer), {{C sharp|float}} (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), {{C sharp|char}} (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), and {{C sharp|System.DateTime}} (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are {{C sharp|enum}} (enumerations) and {{C sharp|struct}} (user defined structures).\n\nIn contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity - each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for {{C sharp|System.String}}). In general, it is not always possible to create an instance of a reference type, nor to copy an existing instance, or perform a value comparison on two existing instances, though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as {{C sharp|ICloneable}} or {{C sharp|IComparable}}). Examples of reference types are {{C sharp|object}} (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), {{C sharp|System.String}} (a string of Unicode characters), and {{C sharp|System.Array}} (a base class for all C# arrays).\n\nBoth type categories are extensible with user-defined types.\n\n===Boxing and unboxing===\n''Boxing'' is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" /> Boxing in C# is implicit.\n\n''Unboxing'' is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" /> Unboxing in C# requires an explicit [[Type conversion|type cast]]. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).<ref>{{cite web|last=Lippert |first=Eric |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/19/representation-and-identity.aspx |title=Representation and Identity |work=Fabulous Adventures In Coding |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nExample:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nint foo = 42;         // Value type.\nobject bar = foo;     // foo is boxed to bar.\nint foo2 = (int)bar;  // Unboxed back to value type.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Libraries==\nThe C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 ''Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)''.\n\nIn addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries|title=Framework Libraries|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic \"[[Hello world]]\" example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis code will display this text in the console window:\n\n Hello, world!\n\nEach line has a purpose:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nusing System;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above line imports all types in the <code>System</code> namespace. For example, the <code>Console</code> class used later in the source code is defined in the <code>System</code> namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name of the type (which includes the namespace).\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nclass Program\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAbove is a [[Class (computer science)|class]] definition. Everything between the following pair of braces describes {{C sharp|Program}}.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nstatic void Main()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the {{C sharp|Main}} method. (Note: {{C sharp|Main}} may also be called from elsewhere, like any other method, e.g. from another method of {{C sharp|Program}}.) The [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|static keyword]] makes the method accessible without an instance of {{C sharp|Program}}. Each console application's {{C sharp|Main}} entry point must be declared {{C sharp|static}}. Otherwise, the program would require an instance, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable [[circular dependency]], C# compilers processing [[console application]]s (like that above) report an error if there is no {{C sharp|static Main}} method. The {{C sharp|void}} keyword declares that {{C sharp|Main}} has no [[return value]].\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis line writes the output. {{C sharp|Console}} is a static class in the {{C sharp|System}} namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the {{C sharp|Console}} method {{C sharp|WriteLine}}, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string {{C sharp|\"Hello, world!\"}}.\n\nA [[GUI]] example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSharp\">\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Hello, World!\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Is almost the same argument!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a [[dialog box]] that contains the message \"Hello, World!\" instead of writing it to the console.\n\nAnother useful library is the <code>System.Drawing</code> library, which is used to programmatically draw images. For example:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nusing System;\nusing System.Drawing;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static Image img;\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        img = Image.FromFile(\"Image.png\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>This will create an image that is identical to that stored in \"Image.png\".\n\n==Standardization and licensing==\nIn August 2001, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard and Intel Corporation co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the [[Common Language Infrastructure|Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]] to the standards organization [[Ecma International]].\nIn December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 ''C# Language Specification''. C# became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - ''Information technology \u2014 Programming languages \u2014 C#''). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002.\n\nIn June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and [[Generic programming|generics]] (somewhat similar to C++ [[template (programming)|templates]]).\n\nIn July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6\u20139 months.\n\nThe C# language definition and the [[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]] are standardized under [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[Ecma]] standards that provide [[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing]] protection from patent claims.\n\nMicrosoft has agreed not to sue open source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the OSP.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecifications/dn646765| title = Patent Pledge for Open Source Developers}}</ref> Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to [[Novell]] products against Novell's paying customers<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/patent_agreement.mspx\n |title        = Patent Cooperation Agreement - Microsoft & Novell Interoperability Collaboration\n |date         = November 2, 2006\n |publisher    = [[Microsoft]]\n |accessdate   = July 5, 2009\n |quote        = Microsoft, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (collectively \"Microsoft\"), hereby covenants not to sue Novell's Customers and Novell's Subsidiaries' Customers for infringement under Covered Patents of Microsoft on account of such a Customer's use of specific copies of a Covered Product as distributed by Novell or its Subsidiaries (collectively \"Novell\") for which Novell has received Revenue (directly or indirectly) for such specific copies; provided the foregoing covenant is limited to use by such Customer (i) of such specific copies that are authorized by Novell in consideration for such Revenue, and (ii) within the scope authorized by Novell in consideration for such Revenue.\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517140252/http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/patent_agreement.mspx\n |archive-date = May 17, 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell's implementation of .NET ([[Mono (software)|The Mono Project]]).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/definitions2.aspx\n | title = Definitions\n | date = November 2, 2006\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | accessdate  = July 5, 2009\n}}</ref> However, Novell maintains that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/faq_opensource.html\n | title = Novell Answers Questions from the Community\n | first = Justin\n | last = Steinman\n | date = November 7, 2006\n | accessdate  = July 5, 2009\n | quote = We maintain that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.\n}}</ref> Microsoft has also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the [[Moonlight (runtime)|Moonlight browser plugin]], which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through [[Novell]].<ref name=\"MsCovenant\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/moonlight.mspx\n |title        = Covenant to Downstream Recipients of Moonlight - Microsoft & Novell Interoperability Collaboration\n |publisher    = [[Microsoft]]\n |quote        = \"Downstream Recipient\" means an entity or individual that uses for its intended purpose a Moonlight Implementation obtained directly from Novell or through an Intermediate Recipient...

Java. In particular:\n\n* Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.\n* [[Curly brackets]] are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into [[namespaces]].\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]].\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\n==Distinguishing features==\n{{See also|Comparison of C Sharp and Java}}\nSome notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:\n\n===Portability===\nBy design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying [[Common Language Infrastructure]]&nbsp;(CLI).<ref>{{cite book|title=Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4 Six-in-One|year=2010|publisher=Wrox Press|isbn=978-0470499481}}</ref>  Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Theoretically, a C# compiler could generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or [[Fortran]].\n\n===Typing===\nC# supports strongly typed implicit variable declarations with the keyword <code>var</code>, and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword <code>new[]</code> followed by a collection initializer.\n\nC# supports a strict [[Boolean data type]], <code>bool</code>. Statements that take conditions, such as <code>while</code> and <code>if</code>, require an expression of a type that implements the <code>true</code> operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as <code>if (a)</code> require only that <code>a</code> is convertible to bool, allowing <code>a</code> to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this \"integer meaning true or false\" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly <code>bool</code> can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as <code>if (a = b)</code> (use of assignment <code>=</code> instead of equality <code>==</code>).\n\nC# is more [[Type safety|type safe]] than C++. The only [[implicit conversion]]s by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]], and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ [[copy constructor]]s and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.\n\nC# has explicit support for [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance and contravariance]] in generic types, unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.\n\n[[enumerated type|Enumeration]] members are placed in their own [[Scope (programming)|scope]].\n\nThe C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.\n\nLocal variables cannot [[Variable shadowing|shadow]] variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Classes do NOT *NEED* to go in a Namespace. Check the spec or try it out yourself before stating otherwise.-->\n\n===Metaprogramming===\n[[Metaprogramming]] via C# attributes is part of the language. Many of these attributes duplicate the functionality of GCC's and VisualC++'s platform-dependent preprocessor directives.\n\n===Methods and functions===\nA method in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a class property. As in other syntactically similar languages, such as C++ and [[ANSI C]], the signature of a method is a declaration comprising in order: any optional scope modifier keywords (such as <code>private</code>), the explicit specification of its return type (such as <code>int</code>, or the keyword <code>void</code> if no value is returned), the name of the method, and finally, a parenthesized sequence of comma-separated parameter specifications, each consisting of a parameter's type, its formal name and optionally, a default value to be used whenever none is provided. Certain specific kinds of methods, such as those that simply get or set a class property by return value or assignment, do not require a full signature, but in the general case, the definition of a class includes the full signature declaration of its methods.\n\nLike C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword <code>virtual</code> to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses.<ref>{{cite web|title=virtual (C# Reference)|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n''Extension methods'' in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to add methods to an object that they feel should exist on that object and its derivatives.\n\nThe type <code>dynamic</code> allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.\n\nC# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword <code>delegate</code>. Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++ ''signal'' and ''slot'', C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.\n\nC# offers Java-like <code>synchronized</code> method calls, via the attribute <code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]</code>, and has support for [[Mutual exclusion|mutually-exclusive locks]] via the keyword <code>lock</code>.\n\n===Property===\nC# provides [[property (programming)|properties]] as [[syntactic sugar]] for a common pattern in which a pair of methods, [[Mutator method|accessor (getter) and mutator (setter)]] encapsulate operations on a single [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] of a class. No redundant method signatures{{Definition needed|The term signature/signatures are used in several places, and without any definition or explanation it is difficult to understand the concepts explained unless you have prior detailed knowledge of how C# define the concept \"Signature\"|date=May 2019}} for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.\n\n===Namespace===\nA C# <code>namespace</code> provides the same level of code isolation as a Java <code>package</code> or a C++ {{C++|namespace}}, with very similar rules and features to a <code>package</code>. Namespaces can be imported with the \"using\" syntax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive|title=using directive - C# Reference|last=|first=|date=|website=Microsoft Docs|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Memory access===\nIn C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as ''unsafe'', and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a \"live\" object or have the well-defined [[Nullable type|null]] value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a \"dead\" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an 'unmanaged' value type that does not contain any references to garbage-collected objects, array, string, or a block of stack-allocated memory. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the <code>System.IntPtr</code> type, but it cannot dereference them.\n\nManaged memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of [[memory leak]]s by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed.\n\n===Exception===\n[[Checked exceptions]] are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html\n| title = The Trouble with Checked Exceptions\n| first1=Bill\n| last1=Venners\n| first2=Bruce\n| last2=Eckel\n| date = August 18, 2003\n| accessdate = March 30, 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===Polymorphism===\nUnlike [[C++]], C# does not support [[multiple inheritance]], although a class can implement any number of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]]. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, i. e. two methods with the same name and taking parameters of the same type in the same order, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and having that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.\n\nHowever, unlike [[Java (programming language)|Java]], C# supports [[operator overloading]]. Only the most commonly overloaded operators in C++ may be overloaded in C#.\n\n===Language Integrated Query (LINQ)===\nC# has the ability to utilize [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]] through the .NET Framework. A developer can query any <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> object, XML documents, an ADO.NET dataset, and a SQL database.<ref>X. D. Zhang et al., \"Research of the Database Access Technology Under.NET Framework\", Applied Mechanics and Materials, Vols. 644-650, pp. 3077-3080, 2014</ref> Using LINQ in C# brings advantages like [[Intelligent code completion|Intellisense]] support, strong filtering capabilities, type safety with compile error checking ability, and consistency for querying data over a variety of sources.<ref>Otey, M. (2006, 02). LINQ to the future. SQL Server Magazine, 8, 17-21. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214859896</ref>  There are several different language structures that can be utilized with C# with LINQ and they are query expressions, lambda expressions, anonymous types, implicitly typed variables, extension methods, and object initializers.<ref>Sheldon, W. (2010, 11). New features in LINQ. SQL Server Magazine, 12, 37-40. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/770609095</ref>\n\n===Functional programming===\nThough primarily an imperative language, C# 2.0 offered limited support for functional programming through [[first-class functions]] and closures in the form of anonymous delegates. C# 3.0 expanded support for functional programming with the introduction of a lightweight syntax for lambda expressions, extension methods (an affordance for modules), and a [[list comprehension]] syntax in the form of a \"query comprehension\" language. C# 7.0 adds features typically found in functional languages like tuples and pattern matching.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7|title=What's New in C# 7.0|last=|first=|date=|website=Microsoft Docs|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Common type system==\nC# has a ''unified type system''. This unified type system is called [[Common Type System]] (CTS).<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\">{{cite book| last = Archer| first = Tom| title = Inside C#| year = 2001| publisher = Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, Washington|isbn=0-7356-1288-9|chapter=Part 2, Chapter 4: The Type System}}</ref>\n\nA unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the {{C sharp|System.Object}} class. For example, every type inherits a {{C sharp|ToString()}} method.\n\n===Categories of data types===\nCTS separates data types into two categories:<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" />\n\n#  Reference types\n#  Value types\n\nInstances of value types do not have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics - equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from {{C sharp|System.ValueType}}, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor. Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as {{C sharp|int}} (a signed 32-bit integer), {{C sharp|float}} (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), {{C sharp|char}} (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), and {{C sharp|System.DateTime}} (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are {{C sharp|enum}} (enumerations) and {{C sharp|struct}} (user defined structures).\n\nIn contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity - each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for {{C sharp|System.String}}). In general, it is not always possible to create an instance of a reference type, nor to copy an existing instance, or perform a value comparison on two existing instances, though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as {{C sharp|ICloneable}} or {{C sharp|IComparable}}). Examples of reference types are {{C sharp|object}} (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), {{C sharp|System.String}} (a string of Unicode characters), and {{C sharp|System.Array}} (a base class for all C# arrays).\n\nBoth type categories are extensible with user-defined types.\n\n===Boxing and unboxing===\n''Boxing'' is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" /> Boxing in C# is implicit.\n\n''Unboxing'' is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.<ref name=\"insidecsharpp2ch4\" /> Unboxing in C# requires an explicit [[Type conversion|type cast]]. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).<ref>{{cite web|last=Lippert |first=Eric |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/19/representation-and-identity.aspx |title=Representation and Identity |work=Fabulous Adventures In Coding |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nExample:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nint foo = 42;         // Value type.\nobject bar = foo;     // foo is boxed to bar.\nint foo2 = (int)bar;  // Unboxed back to value type.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Libraries==\nThe C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 ''Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)''.\n\nIn addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries|title=Framework Libraries|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic \"[[Hello world]]\" example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis code will display this text in the console window:\n\n Hello, world!\n\nEach line has a purpose:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nusing System;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above line imports all types in the <code>System</code> namespace. For example, the <code>Console</code> class used later in the source code is defined in the <code>System</code> namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name of the type (which includes the namespace).\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nclass Program\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAbove is a [[Class (computer science)|class]] definition. Everything between the following pair of braces describes {{C sharp|Program}}.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nstatic void Main()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the {{C sharp|Main}} method. (Note: {{C sharp|Main}} may also be called from elsewhere, like any other method, e.g. from another method of {{C sharp|Program}}.) The [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|static keyword]] makes the method accessible without an instance of {{C sharp|Program}}. Each console application's {{C sharp|Main}} entry point must be declared {{C sharp|static}}. Otherwise, the program would require an instance, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable [[circular dependency]], C# compilers processing [[console application]]s (like that above) report an error if there is no {{C sharp|static Main}} method. The {{C sharp|void}} keyword declares that {{C sharp|Main}} has no [[return value]].\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis line writes the output. {{C sharp|Console}} is a static class in the {{C sharp|System}} namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the {{C sharp|Console}} method {{C sharp|WriteLine}}, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string {{C sharp|\"Hello, world!\"}}.\n\nA [[GUI]] example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSharp\">\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Hello, World!\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Is almost the same argument!\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a [[dialog box]] that contains the message \"Hello, World!\" instead of writing it to the console.\n\nAnother useful library is the <code>System.Drawing</code> library, which is used to programmatically draw images. For example:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nusing System;\nusing System.Drawing;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static Image img;\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        img = Image.FromFile(\"Image.png\");\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>This will create an image that is identical to that stored in \"Image.png\".\n\n==Standardization and licensing==\nIn August 2001, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard and Intel Corporation co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the [[Common Language Infrastructure|Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]] to the standards organization [[Ecma International]].\nIn December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 ''C# Language Specification''. C# became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - ''Information technology \u2014 Programming languages \u2014 C#''). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002.\n\nIn June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and [[Generic programming|generics]] (somewhat similar to C++ [[template (programming)|templates]]).\n\nIn July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6\u20139 months.\n\nThe C# language definition and the [[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]] are standardized under [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[Ecma]] standards that provide [[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing]] protection from patent claims.\n\nMicrosoft has agreed not to sue open source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the OSP.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecifications/dn646765| title = Patent Pledge for Open Source Developers}}</ref> Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to [[Novell]] products against Novell's paying customers<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/patent_agreement.mspx\n |title        = Patent Cooperation Agreement - Microsoft & Novell Interoperability Collaboration\n |date         = November 2, 2006\n |publisher    = [[Microsoft]]\n |accessdate   = July 5, 2009\n |quote        = Microsoft, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (collectively \"Microsoft\"), hereby covenants not to sue Novell's Customers and Novell's Subsidiaries' Customers for infringement under Covered Patents of Microsoft on account of such a Customer's use of specific copies of a Covered Product as distributed by Novell or its Subsidiaries (collectively \"Novell\") for which Novell has received Revenue (directly or indirectly) for such specific copies; provided the foregoing covenant is limited to use by such Customer (i) of such specific copies that are authorized by Novell in consideration for such Revenue, and (ii) within the scope authorized by Novell in consideration for such Revenue.\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517140252/http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/patent_agreement.mspx\n |archive-date = May 17, 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell's implementation of .NET ([[Mono (software)|The Mono Project]]).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/definitions2.aspx\n | title = Definitions\n | date = November 2, 2006\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | accessdate  = July 5, 2009\n}}</ref> However, Novell maintains that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/faq_opensource.html\n | title = Novell Answers Questions from the Community\n | first = Justin\n | last = Steinman\n | date = November 7, 2006\n | accessdate  = July 5, 2009\n | quote = We maintain that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.\n}}</ref> Microsoft has also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the [[Moonlight (runtime)|Moonlight browser plugin]], which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through [[Novell]].<ref name=\"MsCovenant\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/moonlight.mspx\n |title        = Covenant to Downstream Recipients of Moonlight - Microsoft & Novell Interoperability Collaboration\n |publisher    = [[Microsoft]]\n |quote        = \"Downstream Recipient\" means an entity or individual that uses for its intended purpose a Moonlight Implementation obtained directly from Novell or through an Intermediate Recipient...

Fantasyland features [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] at its front, which is also the park's icon, and  a central courtyard dominated by King Arthur's Carrousel, in front of which sits a sword in an anvil; several times each day a costumed Merlin helps a child pull the sword from it. Walt Disney said, \"What youngster has not dreamed of flying with [[Peter Pan]] over moonlit [[London]], or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Wonderland]]? In Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become realities for youngsters - of all ages - to participate in.\"\n\nIn 1983, Fantasyland received a major facelift (dubbed \"New Fantasyland\")<ref name=\"New Fantasyland\">Post card showing \"New Fantasyland\" http://www.perrific.com/disney/cards/card29.html</ref> and the attraction facades changed from a Renaissance motif to a fantasy mock up of a [[Bavaria]]n village. Fantasyland's main entrance is through [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. The entrance also contains a separate walk-through attraction that opened in 1957 but was closed from 2001-2008 due to security concerns following the [[9/11|September 11, attacks]]. The attraction re-opened in May 2008.\n\nThe plaque in front of the castle marks the spot where the Disneyland Time Capsule is buried. Sealed on the 40th anniversary of the park, it contains different items from the history of Disney parks.

The first Tinker Bell was [[Tiny Kline]], former circus aerialist. Multiple shows have replaced this most involving some sort of 'flying' character, such as Tinker Bell.\n\nFantasyland was said, by Walt Disney, to be his favorite land in the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20150226/29986/5-key-facts-about-walt-disney-s-favorite-theme-park-land|title=5 Key Facts about Walt Disney\u2019s Favorite Theme Park Land|work=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Current attractions and entertainment===\n* [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]]\n* [[Casey Jr. Circus Train]]\n* [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant]]\n* [[It's a Small World]]\n* [[King Arthur Carrousel]]\n* [[Mad Tea Party]]\n* [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]\n* [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]\n* [[Peter Pan's Flight]]\n* [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]]\n* [[Pixie Hollow]]\n* Fantasy Faire\n* [[Royal Hall (Disneyland attraction)|Royal Hall]]\n* [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] walk-through\n* [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]]\n* [[Storybook Land Canal Boats]]\n* The Sword in the Stone\n\n===Former attractions and entertainment===\n* Canal Boats of the World (1955)\n* Mickey Mouse Club Circus (1955\u20131956)\n* Mickey Mouse Club Theater (1955\u201382, replaced by Pinocchio's Daring Journey)\n* Keller's Jungle Killers (1956)\n* [[Skyway (Disney)|Skyway to Tomorrowland]] (1956\u201394)\n* [[Motor Boat Cruise]] (1957\u201393)\n* [[Midget Autopia]] (1957\u201366)\n* Fantasyland Autopia (1959\u20131999)\n* Skull Rock (1960\u201382)\n* [[Videopolis]] (1985\u20132006)\n* Fantasyland Depot (1961\u20131993, re-themed as Toon Town Depot)\n* Disney Afternoon Avenue, featuring Disney Afternoon characters (1991):\n** Baloo's Dressing Room\n** [[Motor Boat Cruise]] to Gummi Glen\n** Rescue Rangers Raceway\n* [[Ariel's Grotto]] in Triton's Garden (1996\u20132008, replaced by Pixie Hollow)\n* [[Fantasyland Theater]]:\n** \"Plane Crazy\" Stage Show (1991\u20132012) \n** [[Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage]] (1992\u201395)\n** The Spirit of Pocahontas (1995\u201397)\n** Disney's Animazement -

The Old Mill, which resembles a Dutch windmill and was inspired by the 1937 Academy Award-winning Disney cartoon ''[[The Old Mill]]'', was a feature of the park when it opened in 1992, and serves drinks and snacks. The ride closed in the early 2000s, but the wheel and its eight bucket-like passenger cars were left in place and were seasonally decorated.

In this timeless land of enchantment the age of chivalry, magic and make-believe are reborn and fairy tales come true. Fantasyland is dedicated to the young and the young at heart, to those who believe that when you wish upon a star your dreams do come true.''|sign=[[Walt Disney|Walter E. Disney]], July 17, 1955}}\n\nFantasyland is one of the original themed lands at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. Fantasyland features [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] at its front, which is also the park's icon, and  a central courtyard dominated by King Arthur's Carrousel, in front of which sits a sword in an anvil; several times each day a costumed Merlin helps a child pull the sword from it. Walt Disney said, \"What youngster has not dreamed of flying with [[Peter Pan]] over moonlit [[London]], or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Wonderland]]? In Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become realities for youngsters - of all ages - to participate in.\"\n\nIn 1983, Fantasyland received a major facelift (dubbed \"New Fantasyland\")<ref name=\"New Fantasyland\">Post card showing \"New Fantasyland\" http://www.perrific.com/disney/cards/card29.html</ref> and the attraction facades changed from a Renaissance motif to a fantasy mock up of a [[Bavaria]]n village. Fantasyland's main entrance is through [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. The entrance also contains a separate walk-through attraction that opened in 1957 but was closed from 2001-2008 due to security concerns following the [[9/11|September 11, attacks]]. The attraction re-opened in May 2008.\n\nThe plaque in front of the castle marks the spot where the Disneyland Time Capsule is buried. Sealed on the 40th anniversary of the park, it contains different items from the history of Disney parks. It is scheduled to be opened in the year 2035, forty years after it was first sealed. \nThe famed \"Fantasy in the Sky Fireworks\" show was introduced in 1956, but Tinker Bell's first flight wasn't until 1961. The first Tinker Bell was [[Tiny Kline]], former circus aerialist. Multiple shows have replaced this most involving some sort of 'flying' character, such as Tinker Bell.\n\nFantasyland was said, by Walt Disney, to be his favorite land in the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20150226/29986/5-key-facts-about-walt-disney-s-favorite-theme-park-land|title=5 Key Facts about Walt Disney\u2019s Favorite Theme Park Land|work=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Current attractions and entertainment===\n* [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]]\n* [[Casey Jr. Circus Train]]\n* [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant]]\n* [[It's a Small World]]\n* [[King Arthur Carrousel]]\n* [[Mad Tea Party]]\n* [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]\n* [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]\n* [[Peter Pan's Flight]]\n* [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]]\n* [[Pixie Hollow]]\n* Fantasy Faire\n* [[Royal Hall (Disneyland attraction)|Royal Hall]]\n* [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] walk-through\n* [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]]\n* [[Storybook Land Canal Boats]]\n* The Sword in the Stone\n\n===Former attractions and entertainment===\n* Canal Boats of the World (1955)\n* Mickey Mouse Club Circus (1955\u20131956)\n* Mickey Mouse Club Theater (1955\u201382, replaced by Pinocchio's Daring Journey)\n* Keller's Jungle Killers (1956)\n* [[Skyway (Disney)|Skyway to Tomorrowland]] (1956\u201394)\n* [[Motor Boat Cruise]] (1957\u201393)\n* [[Midget Autopia]] (1957\u201366)\n* Fantasyland Autopia (1959\u20131999)\n* Skull Rock (1960\u201382)\n* [[Videopolis]] (1985\u20132006)\n* Fantasyland Depot (1961\u20131993, re-themed as Toon Town Depot)\n* Disney Afternoon Avenue, featuring Disney Afternoon characters (1991):\n** Baloo's Dressing Room\n** [[Motor Boat Cruise]] to Gummi Glen\n** Rescue Rangers Raceway\n* [[Ariel's Grotto]] in Triton's Garden (1996\u20132008, replaced by Pixie Hollow)\n* [[Fantasyland Theater]]:\n** \"Plane Crazy\" Stage Show (1991\u20132012) \n** [[Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage]] (1992\u201395)\n** The Spirit of Pocahontas (1995\u201397)\n** Disney's Animazement -

The Old Mill, which resembles a Dutch windmill and was inspired by the 1937 Academy Award-winning Disney cartoon ''[[The Old Mill]]'', was a feature of the park when it opened in 1992, and serves drinks and snacks. The ride closed in the early 2000s, but the wheel and its eight bucket-like passenger cars were left in place and were seasonally decorated. It was later reformed, with the buckets removed, the mill's building serving as a snack counter and the queue area as a meet and greet area. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney-pal.com/Disneyland%20Paris/the_old_mill.htm|title=Disneyland Paris - The Old Mill|work=disney-pal.com|access-date=2 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052408/http://disney-pal.com/Disneyland%20Paris/the_old_mill.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdisneylandparis.co.uk/snacks/|title=Snacks|work=Explorer Disney|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Current attractions and entertainment===\n* [[Alice's Curious Labyrinth]]\n* [[Snow White's Scary Adventures|Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains]] (''Snow White's Scary Adventures'')\n* [[Le Carrousel de Lancelot]] (''Lancelot's Carousel'')\n* [[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh|Le Pooh de Petit La Nos Bear]]\n* [[Casey Jr. Circus Train|Casey Jr. - Le Petit Train du Cirque]] (''Casey Jr. Circus Train'')\n* [[Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant]] (''Sleeping Beauty's Castle'')\n* [[Disneyland Railroad (Paris)|Disneyland Paris Railroad]] - Fantasyland Station\n* [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant]]\n* [[Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant|La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant]] (''Sleeping Beauty's Gallery'')\n* Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2teau ''(The Castle Stage)''\n* [[It's a Small World]]\n* [[Mad Tea Party|Mad Hatter's Tea Cups]]\n* Meet Mickey Mouse\n* [[Storybook Land Canal Boats|Le Pays de Contes de F\u00e9es]] (''Storybook Land Canal Boats'')\n* [[Peter Pan's Flight]]\n* Princess Pavilion\n* [[La Tani\u00e8re du Dragon]] (''The Dragon's Lair'')\n* [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey|Les Voyages de Pinocchio]] (''Pinocchio's Fantastic Journey'')\n* [[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]\n\n===Former attractions and entertainment===\n* Les Pirouettes du Vieux Moulin\n* Fantasy Festival Stage:\n** ''Winnie the Pooh and Friends, too!''

{"title_page": "Rule of the shorter term", "text_new": "{{short description|Provision of international copyright law}}\nThe '''rule of the shorter term''', also called the '''comparison of terms''', is a provision in international [[copyright]] [[treaty|treaties]]. The provision allows that signatory countries can limit the duration of copyright they grant to foreign works under [[national treatment]] to no more than the copyright term granted in the country of origin of the work.\n\n==Fundamentals==\nInternational copyright treaties such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (BC) or the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC) work through [[national treatment]]: signatory countries agree to grant copyright to foreign works under their local laws and by the same rules they grant copyright to domestic works. Whether a work is eligible to copyright, and if so, for how long that copyright exists, is governed by the laws of the country where copyright on the work is claimed.<ref name=\"berne_5_2\">Berne Convention: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 Article 5(2)]''. Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> The Berne Convention and also the UCC define only the minimum requirements for copyrights that all signatory countries must meet, but any country is free to go beyond this minimal common denominator in its legislation. This is most noticeable in the duration for which copyrights are upheld. The Berne Convention lays down a minimal general copyright term of 50 years beyond the death of an author (50 years ''[[post mortem auctoris#Post mortem auctoris|p.m.a.]]'').<ref name=\"berne_7_1\">Berne Convention, ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P127_22000 Article 7(1)]''. Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> But many countries have a longer term, such as 70 years ''p.m.a.'', or even 100 years ''p.m.a.''.\n\nOne and the same work may thus be copyrighted for different times in different countries (since, per ''[[lex loci protectionis]]'', the copyright rules of each country apply within its jurisdiction, regardless of the work's country of origin). Its copyright may have expired already in countries with a minimum term, but at the same time, it may still be copyrighted in other countries that have longer copyright terms.<ref name=\"berne_5_2\"/> National treatment may thus lead to an imbalance: works originating from countries with minimal copyright terms are copyrighted longer in other countries that have longer copyright terms. In that situation, works from a country that goes beyond the minimum requirements of a treaty may already have entered the [[public domain]] in foreign countries with shorter copyright term while still being copyrighted at home.\n\nIn such cases, the rule of the shorter term makes allowance for [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in exception to the normal national treatment. Countries with a long copyright term may apply only the shorter foreign term to works from countries that have such a shorter term.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width: 90%;\"\n|+ Hypothetical case where rule of shorter term applies \n|-\n!  !!

Thus other countries would not be obliged to grant copyright on such foreign works, even if similar domestic works were granted copyright.<ref name=\"patry\">Patry, W.: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216051756/http://www.geocities.com/williampatry875/Law_Review.pdf Choice of Law and International Copyright]'', 48 Am.

Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention reads:\n\n{{quote|In any case, the term shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed; however, unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work. \u2014 Berne Convention, article 7(8).<ref name=\"berne_7_8\">Berne Convention: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P127_22000 Article 7(8)]''.

Geneva 1971.</ref> as the example of the United States shows.\n\nThe Berne Convention also states in article 5(2) that the enjoyment and exercise of copyright\n\n{{quote|... shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from the provisions of this Convention, the extent of protection, as well as the means of redress afforded to the author to protect his rights, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed. \u2014 Berne Convention, article 5(2).<ref name=\"berne_5_2\"/>}}\n\nThis specifies national treatment, and also makes the existence of copyright on a work in one country independent from the existence of copyright on the work in other countries (''[[lex loci protectionis]]'').\n\nA WIPO study in 2011 recommended that \u00abThe difficulty of the rule of the comparison of terms applicable to the duration for protection, as provided by Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention, should at least be assessed\u00bb.<ref>Dusollier, Severine, Scoping Study on Copyright and Related Rights and the Public Domain (March 1, 2011).

The only mention of such a rule was added in 1994 with the URAA in 17 USC 104A, which automatically restored copyrights on many foreign works, unless these works had already fallen in the public domain in their country of origin on the URAA date, which is January 1, 1996 for most foreign countries. Because there is no general rule of the shorter term in U.S. Copyright law, U.S. courts have declined to apply that rule on several occasions.\n\n===US case law===\nOne case where this issue was treated was ''Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc.'' ([[Case citation|780 F.2d 189]] (2d Cir 1985)). [[Hasbro]] was distributing Japanese toys (action figures) in the U.S. under an exclusive license and claimed copyright on these toys. Sparkle Toys distributed exact copies of these toy figures. In the case, Sparkle contested Hasbro's copyright claims.<ref name=\"Hasbro\">Judge Friendly: ''[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/780_F2d_189.htm Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v.

Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> In this pre-Berne case, the court arrived at the conclusion that Hasbro was entitled to copyright on the figurines although these toys of Japanese origin were not copyrighted at all in Japan, and even though the toys did not bear a [[copyright notice]]. The case has been criticized in 2000 by [[William F. Patry]], who expressed the opinion that the Judge mistakenly arrived at the conclusion that the U.S. was required to grant copyright on these toys. Patry also concedes that under the Berne Convention, the U.S. would indeed be required to grant copyright to foreign works, even if such works were not copyrighted in their country of origin as per article 5(2) of the Berne Convention.<ref name=\"patry\"/>\n\nWhile the ''Hasbro'' case considered a special case of the applicability of rule of the shorter term in the context of the UCC, the case of ''[[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc.]]'' (4 N.Y.3d 540, [[Second Circuit|2nd Cir.]] 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under the Berne Convention. In this case, [[Capitol Records]] claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the [[United Kingdom]] had expired in the late 1980s. [[Naxos Records]], which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because before [[CLASSICS Act|2018]], pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States were not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to sound recordings anyway) or the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]] usurped the [[New York (state)|State of New York's]] law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York [[common law]]{{spaced ndash}}while the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.<ref name=\"capitol\">Judge Graffeo: ''[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_02570.htm Capitol Records, Inc. v.

This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the duration of copyrights throughout the union to 70 years ''p.m.a.'' It also includes in its article 7 a mandatory rule of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and\u2014as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC\u2014existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0116:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights (codified version) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom provides that, where a work is published simultaneously in multiple countries one of which is an EEA member, the terms of the EEA member state will apply.

The court considered the rule of the shorter term inapplicable because of the bilateral copyright treaty between Germany and the United States, which had become effective on January 15, 1892 and which was still in effect.<ref name=Brauneis2014/> That treaty did not contain a rule of the shorter term, but just stated that works of either country were copyrighted in the other country by the other country's laws.<ref name=\"aa\"/>\n\nThe EU member states implemented Directive 93/98/EEC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:71993L0098:EN:NOT |title=National provisions communicated by the member states concerning directive 93/98/EEC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> and Directive 2006/116/EC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:72006L0116:EN:NOT |title=National provisions communicated by the member states concerning directive 2006/116/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> in their national law; however, it is not guaranteed that such national implementations are either \"comprehensive or in conformity\" with the Directives.\n\n===EU case law===\nEven before article 7 of directive 93/98/EC explicitly prohibited the application of the rule of the shorter term amongst EU countries, the comparison of terms within the EU was not allowed. The [[Treaty instituting the European Community]], which in its original version became effective in 1958, defined in article 7, paragraph 1, that within the union, any discrimination on grounds of nationality was prohibited. (Since 2002, when the treaty was amended by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], this is article 12, paragraph 1.) Application of the rule of the shorter term is such a discrimination, as it results in granting domestic authors longer copyright terms for their works than foreign authors from other EU countries.\n\nThis issue was settled decisively in 1993 (''i.e.'', two years before directive 93/98/EC became effective) by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) in what became known as the ''[[Phil Collins]]'' decision. In that case, Phil Collins sued a German phonogram distributor who was marketing records of a concert Collins had given in the U.S. German law of that time granted German performers full [[neighbouring rights]], and in particular the right to prohibit the distribution of recordings made without their consent, regardless of the place the performance had occurred. At the same time, German law granted the same right to foreign performers only for their performances that had occurred in Germany. The ECJ decided on October 20, 1993 that this was a violation of the non-discrimination clause of article 7 of the EC treaty. It also clarified that the non-discrimination clause was indeed applicable to copyright.<ref name=\"collins\">[[European Court of Justice]]: ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61992J0092:EN:NOT Phil Collins v Imtrat Handelsgesellschaft mbH and Patricia Im- und Export Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH and Leif Emanuel Kraul v EMI Electrola GmbH]'', joined cases C-92/92 and C-326/92; judgment of the court of October 20, 1993.

Under the German laws of the time, the rule of the shorter term applied to foreign works and the opera was thus in the [[public domain]] in Germany since the end of 1980, when its 56-year Italian copyright term had run out.

This is most noticeable in the duration for which copyrights are upheld. The Berne Convention lays down a minimal general copyright term of 50 years beyond the death of an author (50 years ''[[post mortem auctoris#Post mortem auctoris|p.m.a.]]'').<ref name=\"berne_7_1\">Berne Convention, ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P127_22000 Article 7(1)]''. Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> But many countries have a longer term, such as 70 years ''p.m.a.'', or even 100 years ''p.m.a.''.\n\nOne and the same work may thus be copyrighted for different times in different countries (since, per ''[[lex loci protectionis]]'', the copyright rules of each country apply within its jurisdiction, regardless of the work's country of origin). Its copyright may have expired already in countries with a minimum term, but at the same time, it may still be copyrighted in other countries that have longer copyright terms.<ref name=\"berne_5_2\"/> National treatment may thus lead to an imbalance: works originating from countries with minimal copyright terms are copyrighted longer in other countries that have longer copyright terms. In that situation, works from a country that goes beyond the minimum requirements of a treaty may already have entered the [[public domain]] in foreign countries with shorter copyright term while still being copyrighted at home.\n\nIn such cases, the rule of the shorter term makes allowance for [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in exception to the normal national treatment. Countries with a long copyright term may apply only the shorter foreign term to works from countries that have such a shorter term.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width: 90%;\"\n|+ Hypothetical case where rule of shorter term applies \n|-\n!  !!

L. 100-568).<ref name=\"BCIA\">United States Congress: ''[http://www.cni.org/docs/infopols/US.Berne.Convention.html Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607202655/http://www.cni.org/docs/infopols/US.Berne.Convention.html |date=2007-06-07 }}'', Pub. L. 100-568. Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> The BCIA made clear that within the U.S., only U.S. copyright law applied, and that U.S. copyright law, as amended by the BCIA, implemented the requirements of the Berne Convention (although it did not implement \u00a718(1) of the Berne Convention, a deviation that was corrected by the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] (URAA) in 1994).\n\nThis statement from public law 100-568 is repeated in the U.S. Copyright law in 17 USC 104, which assimilates foreign works to domestic works and which furthermore states in 17 USC 104(c) that\n\n{{quote|No right or interest in a work eligible for protection under this title may be claimed by virtue of, or in reliance upon; the provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto.

Retrieved 2007-05-25.</ref> But Title 17 of the [[United States Code]] does not contain any article on the rule of the shorter term. The only mention of such a rule was added in 1994 with the URAA in 17 USC 104A, which automatically restored copyrights on many foreign works, unless these works had already fallen in the public domain in their country of origin on the URAA date, which is January 1, 1996 for most foreign countries. Because there is no general rule of the shorter term in U.S. Copyright law, U.S. courts have declined to apply that rule on several occasions.\n\n===US case law===\nOne case where this issue was treated was ''Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc.'' ([[Case citation|780 F.2d 189]] (2d Cir 1985)). [[Hasbro]] was distributing Japanese toys (action figures) in the U.S. under an exclusive license and claimed copyright on these toys. Sparkle Toys distributed exact copies of these toy figures. In the case, Sparkle contested Hasbro's copyright claims.<ref name=\"Hasbro\">Judge Friendly: ''[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/780_F2d_189.htm Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc.], 780 F.2d 189, [[Second Circuit]], 1985. Retrieved 2007-05-20.</ref> In this pre-Berne case, the court arrived at the conclusion that Hasbro was entitled to copyright on the figurines although these toys of Japanese origin were not copyrighted at all in Japan, and even though the toys did not bear a [[copyright notice]]. The case has been criticized in 2000 by [[William F. Patry]], who expressed the opinion that the Judge mistakenly arrived at the conclusion that the U.S. was required to grant copyright on these toys. Patry also concedes that under the Berne Convention, the U.S. would indeed be required to grant copyright to foreign works, even if such works were not copyrighted in their country of origin as per article 5(2) of the Berne Convention.<ref name=\"patry\"/>\n\nWhile the ''Hasbro'' case considered a special case of the applicability of rule of the shorter term in the context of the UCC, the case of ''[[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc.]]'' (4 N.Y.3d 540, [[Second Circuit|2nd Cir.]] 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, [[Capitol Records]] claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the [[United Kingdom]] had expired in the late 1980s. [[Naxos Records]], which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because before [[CLASSICS Act|2018]], pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States were not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to sound recordings anyway) or the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]] usurped the [[New York (state)|State of New York's]] law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York [[common law]]{{spaced ndash}}while the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.<ref name=\"capitol\">Judge Graffeo: ''[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_02570.htm Capitol Records, Inc. v.

This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the duration of copyrights throughout the union to 70 years ''p.m.a.'' It also includes in its article 7 a mandatory rule of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and\u2014as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC\u2014existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0116:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights (codified version) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom provides that, where a work is published simultaneously in multiple countries one of which is an EEA member, the terms of the EEA member state will apply. If upheld under the EU directive, this would mean that a book published simultaneously worldwide by a Canadian publisher would be subject to a term of 70 pma in UK and 50 pma in France.<ref name=Brauneis2014/>\n\nGermany extends the non-applicability of the rule of the shorter term to all members of the [[European Economic Area]] in \u00a7120 of its ''Urheberrechtsgesetz''.<ref name=\"urhg_120\">Germany: ''[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/__120.html Urheberrechtsgesetz, \u00a7120]''.

In a case decided on October 7, 2003 by the ''Oberlandesgericht'' of [[Hesse]] in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], the court ruled that a U.S. work that had fallen in the public domain in the U.S. was still copyrighted in Germany. The court considered the rule of the shorter term inapplicable because of the bilateral copyright treaty between Germany and the United States, which had become effective on January 15, 1892 and which was still in effect.<ref name=Brauneis2014/> That treaty did not contain a rule of the shorter term, but just stated that works of either country were copyrighted in the other country by the other country's laws.<ref name=\"aa\"/>\n\nThe EU member states implemented Directive 93/98/EEC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:71993L0098:EN:NOT |title=National provisions communicated by the member states concerning directive 93/98/EEC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> and Directive 2006/116/EC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:72006L0116:EN:NOT |title=National provisions communicated by the member states concerning directive 2006/116/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> in their national law; however, it is not guaranteed that such national implementations are either \"comprehensive or in conformity\" with the Directives.\n\n===EU case law===\nEven before article 7 of directive 93/98/EC explicitly prohibited the application of the rule of the shorter term amongst EU countries, the comparison of terms within the EU was not allowed. The [[Treaty instituting the European Community]], which in its original version became effective in 1958, defined in article 7, paragraph 1, that within the union, any discrimination on grounds of nationality was prohibited. (Since 2002, when the treaty was amended by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], this is article 12, paragraph 1.) Application of the rule of the shorter term is such a discrimination, as it results in granting domestic authors longer copyright terms for their works than foreign authors from other EU countries.\n\nThis issue was settled decisively in 1993 (''i.e.'', two years before directive 93/98/EC became effective) by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) in what became known as the ''[[Phil Collins]]'' decision. In that case, Phil Collins sued a German phonogram distributor who was marketing records of a concert Collins had given in the U.S. German law of that time granted German performers full [[neighbouring rights]], and in particular the right to prohibit the distribution of recordings made without their consent, regardless of the place the performance had occurred. At the same time, German law granted the same right to foreign performers only for their performances that had occurred in Germany. The ECJ decided on October 20, 1993 that this was a violation of the non-discrimination clause of article 7 of the EC treaty. It also clarified that the non-discrimination clause was indeed applicable to copyright.<ref name=\"collins\">[[European Court of Justice]]: ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61992J0092:EN:NOT Phil Collins v Imtrat Handelsgesellschaft mbH and Patricia Im- und Export Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH and Leif Emanuel Kraul v EMI Electrola GmbH]'', joined cases C-92/92 and C-326/92; judgment of the court of October 20, 1993.

Under the German laws of the time, the rule of the shorter term applied to foreign works and the opera was thus in the [[public domain]] in Germany since the end of 1980, when its 56-year Italian copyright term had run out. (Puccini had died on November 29, 1924.) Domestic works at the same time enjoyed a copyright term of 70 years after the authors death in Germany. A publisher of musical works claimed to hold the rights to Puccini's works in Germany, and took the state of Hesse to court, based on the non-discrimination clause, which he claimed prescribed a copyright term of 70 years in Germany also for foreign works.<ref name=\"boheme\">[[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]]: ''[http://www.jusline.de/index.php?cpid=6d44c6cd2f88632271f33c6fcd336a73&law_id=2&paid=121&feed=27018&suchbegriff=&absatz= Decision I ZR 133/97: La Boh\u00e8me]'', decision of March 30, 2000.

In 1859, while serving in his new role as [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], a lawsuit involving his dispute with NYA precipitated the split in Yarmouth's First Parish Church.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

The architect was Alexander Longfellow, a nephew of the poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. Also involved in the library's construction was John Coombs, father of George and Albert. Despite the occasional flood, town offices were eventually established in the library's basement.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.41</ref> The flooding was partly caused by the blockage of Cleaves Brook (where today's police station is) \u2014 which formerly drained the whole center of town \u2014 when Brickyard Hollow was filled in.\n\nDirectly across the street from the library stood the Dumphy house and barn. These were auctioned off in 1921, creating more public space in Centervale.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.42</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the town's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans sought permission to place a soldiers monument in front of the new schools.

On the left (number 146) is formerly that of Captain Joseph Drinkwater and his wife, Anna. The house was built in 1844, and his family owned it until 1873. Captain Sumner Drinkwater purchased it in 1902, and it remained in his family until 1979, ending 107 consecutive years of Drinkwater ownership.<ref name=gaertner/> Next, on the right, is 161, once the home of Samuel Allen Prince.

Upon Reuben's death, the house passed to his son, Harlan, and remained in his family until his death.

First, an 1817-built house on the left, is formerly that of Mrs. Drinkwater. Next, beyond Burbank Lane, at 38 Larrabee's Landing Road, is the former home of Mrs. Bucknam. The original part of the house dates from 1835 and is believed to have been expanded by William Bucknam for his mother. It later became the home of New Hampshire natives Nelson and Fannie Burbank, for whom Burbank Lane was built. They owned and operated Burbank Farm from 1913 to 1936. The house of Charles Bucknam, at number 68, is the final home before Royall Point Road. It was built in 1835. \n\nThe only house originally on Royall Point Road was the [[farmhouse]] at the current number 70. Nearby Callen Point was where Captain Walter Gendall (d. 1688),<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002070890232;view=1up;seq=37 \"Captain Walter Gendall: A Biographical Sketch\"] - Doctor Charles E.

For several years it had become a favorite camping spot for the villagers and the inhabitants of the inland parts of the town who came here for [[clam bake]]s and picnics. The town road ended at the John Allen Drinkwater barn, and here a large gate opened into the pasture which included the two points now known as Princes and Sunset Points. Captain Rotheus Drinkwater also had a home a stone's throw away. Captain John Cleaves fenced off a spot on his farm, at today's number 581, for the same purpose.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nThe first cottage was built in 1884. It was later known as Battery Point Cottage. Others soon built nearby, including Dr. Herbert A. Merrill, Leone R. Cook, George H. Jefferds, Thomas and Nellie Johnston and Wilfred W. Dunn. The first to take up a lot on the western promontory now known as Sunset Point was Samuel O. Carruthers.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1894 a wharf was built, and the steamer ''Madeline'' made two trips daily from Portland, stopping off at the Cumberland and Falmouth Foresides. The short-lived electric railroad running the same route forced the discontinuation of the service.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1899, a four-story hotel of about thirty rooms, named Gem of the Bay, was built on Princes Point by Cornelius Harris.<ref name=rowe1936/> It was destroyed by fire in October 1900 after two seasons in business.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n==Drinkwater Point==\nNamed for Captain Theophilus Drinkwater, son of Allen and Hannah Drinkwater.

Bucknam wed Caroline Pierce Drinkwater in 1843 and they had five children together \u2014 Nicholas, Clarence Leland, Caroline Augusta, Clarence Loraine and James M., Jr. They were married for 26 years, until 1869, Caroline's death.

The oldest remaining church, the [[North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse]], was built in 1796.\n\nThree of these historic churches are located on Main Street; they are (from east to west):\n\n===First Universalist===\n[[Image:Central_Parish_Yarmouth.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]]]]\n\nThe [[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]] (formerly known as the Central Parish Church) is located at 97 Main Street. It was built in 1860 for an Orthodox Congregational parish, and is one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It became its current denomination ([[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1886. It became listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The site was formerly occupied by Jenks's Tavern.\n\n===First Parish Congregational===\n[[File:First Parish Yarmouth Maine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[First Parish Congregational Church]]]]\n\nThe [[First Parish Congregational Church|First Parish Congregational]], at 116 Main Street, was built in 1867. It was designed by Portland architect [[George M. Harding]], and it is the third incarnation of churches built for the town's Congregationalists. [[Charles Augustus Aiken]] was ordained a pastor here in 1854.\n\nThe First Parish Congregational was originally known as the Meeting House Under the Ledge and was located facing [[Casco Bay]] at the intersection of Route 88 and Gilman Road. It was built from material floated down the Royal River from the First Falls and hauled up by [[ox]]en from Larrabee's Landing (named for Benjamin and Thomas Larrabee, two brothers who settled there in the 1720s), further down Gilman Road towards Cousins Island. The path down to the water still exists. The landing was one of the most important in Yarmouth up until the late 1870s, when erosion caused the whole thing to slide into the channel. The Ledge church, which was founded on November 18, 1730, was torn down in 1836<!--Images of America: Yarmouth states it was 1833-->, sixteen years after it was abandoned by the Parish. Yarmouth's early [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] fired one minister because he suggested that many people are worthy of salvation. [[Reverend]] Tristram Gilman, on the other hand, declared in a sermon that [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Of a settlement that originally contained a school, a tavern and a cemetery of Indian fighters, only the cemetery and the ledge doorstep of the church remain. The weathervane, which was the final addition to the steeple, was mounted in 1838 as a shipping guide on an iron rod atop the ledge overlooking the \"Old Ledge\" Meeting House by a group of Yarmouth residents. They had raised funds to buy the weathervane from Solomon Winslow, who had removed it from the site after the building's demolition. The weathervane is now on display at the Yarmouth History Center, but its old supports still exist up in the woods beside Route 88. They are passed by the [[West Side Trail]].<ref>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/about-the-weathervane/ \"About the Weathervane\"] - Yarmouth Historical Society's website</ref> A second, larger cemetery, known as Ledge Cemetery, was established in 1770.\n\nTristram Gilman died in 1809. [[Francis Brown (1784\u20131820)|Francis Brown]], an 1805 graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] and later its president, was invited to preach before the Congregational church. Brown accepted the position of pastor, with the proviso that the church, which had been in use for nearly eighty years, be discontinued.<ref name=Aldredge>''Yarmouth Revisited'', Amy Aldredge</ref> The second church (known as ''Old Sloop'') was built in 1818, at the eastern corner of Main and Bridge Streets (at present-day 121 Main Street), but it was abandoned in 1868 and torn down in 1879. (Lorenzo L. Shaw later lived here in a carriage house, but it burned down in a fire in 1967.) Brown married Elizabeth Gilman, the eldest daughter of his predecessor. Their son was [[Samuel Gilman Brown]]. Samuel's son, another [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]], was a [[theologian]].\n\nThose who were against the building of the new church incorporated themselves as the Chapel Religious Society.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nThe present church was built on the other side of Main Street in 1867 and [[dedication|dedicated]] the following year.

It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During [[World War II]], the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the [[Civil defense|Civil Defense System]]. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling.

Despite the occasional flood, town offices were eventually established in the library's basement.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

On the left (number 146) is formerly that of Captain Joseph Drinkwater and his wife, Anna. The house was built in 1844, and his family owned it until 1873. Captain Sumner Drinkwater purchased it in 1902, and it remained in his family until 1979, ending 107 consecutive years of Drinkwater ownership.<ref name=gaertner/> Next, on the right, is 161, once the home of Samuel Allen Prince.

First, an 1817-built house on the left, is formerly that of Mrs. Drinkwater. Next, beyond Burbank Lane, at 38 Larrabee's Landing Road, is the former home of Mrs. Bucknam. The original part of the house dates from 1835 and is believed to have been expanded by William Bucknam for his mother. It later became the home of New Hampshire natives Nelson and Fannie Burbank, for whom Burbank Lane was built. They owned and operated Burbank Farm from 1913 to 1936. The house of Charles Bucknam, at number 68, is the final home before Royall Point Road. It was built in 1835. \n\nThe only house originally on Royall Point Road was the [[farmhouse]] at the current number 70. Nearby Callen Point was where Captain Walter Gendall (d. 1688),<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002070890232;view=1up;seq=37 \"Captain Walter Gendall: A Biographical Sketch\"] - Doctor Charles E.

For several years it had become a favorite camping spot for the villagers and the inhabitants of the inland parts of the town who came here for [[clam bake]]s and picnics. The town road ended at the John Allen Drinkwater barn, and here a large gate opened into the pasture which included the two points now known as Princes and Sunset Points. Captain Rotheus Drinkwater also had a home a stone's throw away. Captain John Cleaves fenced off a spot on his farm, at today's number 581, for the same purpose.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nThe first cottage was built in 1884. It was later known as Battery Point Cottage. Others soon built nearby, including Dr. Herbert A. Merrill, Leone R. Cook, George H. Jefferds, Thomas and Nellie Johnston and Wilfred W. Dunn. The first to take up a lot on the western promontory now known as Sunset Point was Samuel O. Carruthers.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1894 a wharf was built, and the steamer ''Madeline'' made two trips daily from Portland, stopping off at the Cumberland and Falmouth Foresides. The short-lived electric railroad running the same route forced the discontinuation of the service.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1899, a four-story hotel of about thirty rooms, named Gem of the Bay, was built on Princes Point by Cornelius Harris.<ref name=rowe1936/> It was destroyed by fire in October 1900 after two seasons in business.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n==Drinkwater Point==\nNamed for Captain Theophilus Drinkwater, son of Allen and Hannah Drinkwater.

Bucknam wed Caroline Pierce Drinkwater in 1843 and they had five children together \u2014 Nicholas, Clarence Leland, Caroline Augusta, Clarence Loraine and James M., Jr. They were married for 26 years, until 1869, Caroline's death.

The oldest remaining church, the [[North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse]], was built in 1796.\n\nThree of these historic churches are located on Main Street; they are (from east to west):\n\n===First Universalist===\n[[Image:Central_Parish_Yarmouth.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]]]]\n\nThe [[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]] (formerly known as the Central Parish Church) is located at 97 Main Street. It was built in 1860 for an Orthodox Congregational parish, and is one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It became its current denomination ([[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1886. It became listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The site was formerly occupied by Jenks's Tavern.\n\n===First Parish Congregational===\n[[File:First Parish Yarmouth Maine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[First Parish Congregational Church]]]]\n\nThe [[First Parish Congregational Church|First Parish Congregational]], at 116 Main Street, was built in 1867. It was designed by Portland architect [[George M. Harding]], and it is the third incarnation of churches built for the town's Congregationalists. [[Charles Augustus Aiken]] was ordained a pastor here in 1854.\n\nThe First Parish Congregational was originally known as the Meeting House Under the Ledge and was located facing [[Casco Bay]] at the intersection of Route 88 and Gilman Road. It was built from material floated down the Royal River from the First Falls and hauled up by [[ox]]en from Larrabee's Landing (named for Benjamin and Thomas Larrabee, two brothers who settled there in the 1720s), further down Gilman Road towards Cousins Island. The path down to the water still exists. The landing was one of the most important in Yarmouth up until the late 1870s, when erosion caused the whole thing to slide into the channel. The Ledge church, which was founded on November 18, 1730, was torn down in 1836<!--Images of America: Yarmouth states it was 1833-->, sixteen years after it was abandoned by the Parish. Yarmouth's early [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] fired one minister because he suggested that many people are worthy of salvation. [[Reverend]] Tristram Gilman, on the other hand, declared in a sermon that [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Of a settlement that originally contained a school, a tavern and a cemetery of Indian fighters, only the cemetery and the ledge doorstep of the church remain. The weathervane, which was the final addition to the steeple, was mounted in 1838 as a shipping guide on an iron rod atop the ledge overlooking the \"Old Ledge\" Meeting House by a group of Yarmouth residents. They had raised funds to buy the weathervane from Solomon Winslow, who had removed it from the site after the building's demolition. The weathervane is now on display at the Yarmouth History Center, but its old supports still exist up in the woods beside Route 88. They are passed by the [[West Side Trail]].<ref>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/about-the-weathervane/ \"About the Weathervane\"] - Yarmouth Historical Society's website</ref> A second, larger cemetery, known as Ledge Cemetery, was established in 1770.\n\nTristram Gilman died in 1809. [[Francis Brown (1784\u20131820)|Francis Brown]], an 1805 graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] and later its president, was invited to preach before the Congregational church. Brown accepted the position of pastor, with the proviso that the church, which had been in use for nearly eighty years, be discontinued.<ref name=Aldredge>''Yarmouth Revisited'', Amy Aldredge</ref> The second church (known as ''Old Sloop'') was built in 1818, at the eastern corner of Main and Bridge Streets (at present-day 121 Main Street), but it was abandoned in 1868 and torn down in 1879. (Lorenzo L. Shaw later lived here in a carriage house, but it burned down in a fire in 1967.) Brown married Elizabeth Gilman, the eldest daughter of his predecessor. Their son was [[Samuel Gilman Brown]]. Samuel's son, another [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]], was a [[theologian]].\n\nThose who were against the building of the new church incorporated themselves as the Chapel Religious Society.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nThe present church was built on the other side of Main Street in 1867 and [[dedication|dedicated]] the following year.

It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During [[World War II]], the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the [[Civil defense|Civil Defense System]]. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling.

The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|04|05}}, seven additional cases have been confirmed, one each in Kathmandu and Kanchanpur districts, two in Baglung and three in Kailai. Seven of the eight active cases involve people who had recently reutrned from abroad; the first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in a 34-year-old woman from Kailali. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 15 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January.

Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds.
