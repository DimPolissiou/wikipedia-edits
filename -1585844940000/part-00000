It is situated on the confluence of rivers Vrbas and Sava. As of 2013, it has a population of 17,587 inhabitantsy, while the town of Srbac has a population of 2,707 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:razglednica-1911.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A post card of Bosanski Svinjar from 1911]]\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nMunicipality of Srbac is situated at the entry of the river Vrbas into the river Sava.The source of the river [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] is about {{Convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.The area around Srbac is mountainous woodland to the south-east (40% of the total area) and farmland to the south-west (60% of total area). The city itself is built in the [[Pannonia]] valley, which is located on the transition between low mountain areas and flat farmlands. The mountain ranges to the south-east are called Motajica and the highest peak is called Gradina at 652m above sea level. The lowest point is 89m in the Vlaknica (small village) along the [[Sava]] river.\n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Municipality of Srbac is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska between the [[45.5\u00b0 N 17.31\u00b0 E|45.5\u00b0 N. 17.31\u00b0 E]]. and borders the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Lakta\u0161i and Gradi\u0161ka and has a 42km long border with the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]]. The Municipality of Srbac covers an area of 453 km\u00b2 (174.9 mi\u00b2) and consists of 39 villages.  \n\n===Climate===\nSrbac has a [[continental climate]], with harsh winters and warm summers. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 25[[\u00b0C]] (77[[\u00b0F]]). The coldest month of the year is January, when temperatures average -5[[\u00b0C]] (23 [[\u00b0F]]).\nAnnual precipitation for Srbac is about 875&nbsp;mm. Due to the city's high latitude; it snows in Srbac almost every year as well. Strong winds come from the north and northeast bringing in lots of snow.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:karta-velika-srbac.gif|thumb|200px|Map of the Srbac municipality]]\n[[Image:crkva-srbac.jpg|thumb|200px|Serbian Orthodox Church]]\n\nArchaeological evidence points to an [[Iron Age]] settlement existing in the region (Cagan grad). Before the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the town was mentioned in this area. As throughout in the Balkans during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman occupation]], towns were constantly burnt and destroyed. In the cadastral area of modern Srbac the historical town of Svinjar existed (meaning \"swine stable\").\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nAt the time of the [[Long War (1591\u20131606)]], Ahmet Hafiz-pasha transported his huge army from Ottoman-held Slavonia across the Sava at Svinjar further into Bosnia (1596). During Ottoman occupation the region was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]]. Svinjar was one of the important rebel sites in Bosnia during the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201378)]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]; one of the battles took place here on 21 November 1875 at a place called Srbac where [[hajduks]] of [[Motajica]] burnt down and destroyed an Ottoman military camp.\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\nIn the late 19th century Svinjar was under [[Austro-Hungary]]. In 1888 a primary school was opened in Svinjar. Between the years of 1899 to 1921 around 7,000 Poles and around 5,000 Ukrainians migrated and settled in the area. Towards the end of 1929 a medical centre was also opened in Svinjar. On 2 November 1933 the minister of internal affairs of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] changed the town name into Srbac. \n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nDuring [[World War II]] these parts were frequently invaded by all the warring sides. During the 1970s Srbac saw rapid growth with the opening of a new textile factory and a packaging material factory. However, economic growth stopped during the [[Bosnian War]]. Srbac was bombarded 3 times during the war by Croatian forces in the summer of 1992 only. No one was killed in these 3 incidents and Srbac suffered only minor structural damage.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Opstina Srbac.gif|thumb|200px|City Council building.]]\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 17,587, while the town of Srbac had the population of 2,707 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is situated on the confluence of rivers Vrbas and Sava. As of 2013, it has a population of 17,587 inhabitantsy, while the town of Srbac has a population of 2,707 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:razglednica-1911.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A post card of Bosanski Svinjar from 1911]]\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nMunicipality of Srbac is situated at the entry of the river Vrbas into the river Sava.The source of the river [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] is about {{Convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.The area around Srbac is mountainous woodland to the south-east (40% of the total area) and farmland to the south-west (60% of total area). The city itself is built in the [[Pannonia]] valley, which is located on the transition between low mountain areas and flat farmlands. The mountain ranges to the south-east are called Motajica and the highest peak is called Gradina at 652m above sea level. The lowest point is 89m in the Vlaknica (small village) along the [[Sava]] river.\n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Municipality of Srbac is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska between the [[45.5\u00b0 N 17.31\u00b0 E|45.5\u00b0 N. 17.31\u00b0 E]]. and borders the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Lakta\u0161i and Gradi\u0161ka and has a 42km long border with the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]]. The Municipality of Srbac covers an area of 453 km\u00b2 (174.9 mi\u00b2) and consists of 39 villages.  \n\n===Climate===\nSrbac has a [[continental climate]], with harsh winters and warm summers. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 25[[\u00b0C]] (77[[\u00b0F]]). The coldest month of the year is January, when temperatures average -5[[\u00b0C]] (23 [[\u00b0F]]).\nAnnual precipitation for Srbac is about 875&nbsp;mm. Due to the city's high latitude; it snows in Srbac almost every year as well. Strong winds come from the north and northeast bringing in lots of snow.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:karta-velika-srbac.gif|thumb|200px|Map of the Srbac municipality]]\n[[Image:crkva-srbac.jpg|thumb|200px|Serbian Orthodox Church]]\n\nArchaeological evidence points to an [[Iron Age]] settlement existing in the region (Cagan grad). Before the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the town was mentioned in this area. As throughout in the Balkans during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman occupation]], towns were constantly burnt and destroyed. In the cadastral area of modern Srbac the historical town of Svinjar existed (meaning \"swine stable\").\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nAt the time of the [[Long War (1591\u20131606)]], Ahmet Hafiz-pasha transported his huge army from Ottoman-held Slavonia across the Sava at Svinjar further into Bosnia (1596). During Ottoman occupation the region was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]]. Svinjar was one of the important rebel sites in Bosnia during the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201378)]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]; one of the battles took place here on 21 November 1875 at a place called Srbac where [[hajduks]] of [[Motajica]] burnt down and destroyed an Ottoman military camp.\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\nIn the late 19th century Svinjar was under [[Austro-Hungary]]. In 1888 a primary school was opened in Svinjar. Between the years of 1899 to 1921 around 7,000 Poles and around 5,000 Ukrainians migrated and settled in the area. Towards the end of 1929 a medical centre was also opened in Svinjar. On 2 November 1933 the minister of internal affairs of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] changed the town name into Srbac. \n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nDuring [[World War II]] these parts were frequently invaded by all the warring sides. During the 1970s Srbac saw rapid growth with the opening of a new textile factory and a packaging material factory. However, economic growth stopped during the [[Bosnian War]].

He contributed verses to the local newspapers and published some pamphlets, before leaving his native city in early life. After a period of military service, he lived at first in [[Edinburgh]] but finally settled in [[London]], where he gained a reputation as a writer and composer of songs and ballads.

This antagonised the victims such that Linley reportedly \"bolted to London in a huff\".<ref name=ODNB/> He later moved to Edinburgh, where he married and was briefly a partner in a mercantile firm in [[Leith]].\n\n===Writing career in London===\nLinley eventually settled in London, where he wrote and composed several hundred songs between 1830 and 1865. Among his most fashionable and popular ballads, composed between 1830 and 1847, were ''Thou art gone from my gaze'', ''Song of the roving gipsey'', ''Constance''; and later, between 1852 and 1862, with a stronger vein of melody, ''Minnie'', ''Old friends at home'', and the [[Robert Burns]] poem, ''The Jolly Beggars''. Linley also wrote the English words to the song \"[[God Bless the Prince of Wales]]\" (originally performed in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), which was completed and performed in 1863.\n\nLinley's flowing style of composition was little suited to the stage, and his musical pieces produced at London theaters had small measure of success. The musical play, ''Franceses Doria'', for which he wrote the songs and the music, was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, on 3 March 1849, and published in the same year. ''The Toymakers'', an operetta, was brought out at Covent Garden Theatre by the English Opera Company on 19 November 1861. ''Law versus Love'', comedietta in one act, by him, was performed at the Princess's Theatre on 6 December 1862.\n\nLinley was also the author of some farces, and of satirical poems. His ''Musical Cynics of London, a Satire; Sketch the First'', London, 1862, a savage onslaught upon music critic [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] proved more fatal to the reputation of the author than to that of the victim. It contained smart and clever passages, and, like the ''Modern Hudibras'', 1864, was widely read, and passed through two editions. ''The Showman'', a work upon which Linley was engaged towards the end of his life, was not published.\n\n===Marriage and children===\nOn 4 April 1824, Linley married Violet Gilchrist in Edinburgh. She was the youngest daughter of the [[linguistics|linguist]], [[John Gilchrist (linguist)|John Borthwick Gilchrist]].<ref name=ODNB/> They had 6 children (3 sons and 3 daughters) but two of the daughters died in childhood.

Produced by Bowie, he gave the song to the band after they rejected Bowie's \"[[Suffragette City]]\". Bowie would subsequently record the song himself. Regarded as an anthem of [[glam rock]], the song has received acclaim and was a commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated \"All the Young Dudes\" No. 253 in its list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and on its 2010 update was ranked at number 256. It is also one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\n==Composition==\nRegarded as one of [[glam rock]]'s anthems,<ref name=\"Bowie: The Illustrated Record\"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Betts |first=Stephen |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/mott-the-hoople-all-the-young-dudes-20110526 |title=Mott the Hoople, 'All the Young Dudes' \u2013 500 Greatest Songs of All Time |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2016-01-19 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107031710/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/mott-the-hoople-all-the-young-dudes-20110526 |archive-date=7 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> the song originated after Bowie came into contact with Mott the Hoople's bassist [[Peter Watts (musician)|Peter Watts]] and learned that the band was ready to split due to continued lack of commercial success. When the band rejected his first offer of a composition, \"[[Suffragette City]]\" (which later appeared on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''), Bowie wrote \"All the Young Dudes\" in short order especially for them, allegedly sitting cross-legged on the floor of a room in London's [[Regent Street]], in front of the band's lead singer, [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (2005). ''Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.131</ref> In the 2017 film ''Beside Bowie'', Kevin Cann (author of ''David Bowie: A Chronology'') stated that \"'All the Young Dudes' is David's version of '[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'\", which germinated from Lou Reed lending him a demo of the song.\n\nWith its [[dirge]]-like music, youth suicide references and calls to an imaginary audience, the song bore similarities to Bowie's own \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", the final track from ''Ziggy Stardust''. Described as being to glam rock what \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" was to the [[hippie]] era, the lyrics [[namecheck|name-checked]] contemporary stars [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and contained references to [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] have described the track as \"one of that rare breed: rock songs which hymn the solidarity of the disaffected without distress or sentimentality\".<ref name=\"Bowie: The Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': p.117</ref>\n\nBowie himself once claimed that the song was not intended to be an anthem for glam, that it actually carried a darker message of apocalypse. According to an interview Bowie gave to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, the boys are carrying the same news that the newscaster was carrying in the song \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" from Ziggy Stardust; the news being the fact that the Earth had only five years left to live. Bowie explains: \"All the Young Dudes is a song about this news. It's no hymn to the youth, as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-19740228 | title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman | work=Rolling Stone | date=28 February 1974 | accessdate=27 March 2017 | author=Copetas, Craig | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326224810/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-19740228 | archive-date=26 March 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> \"All the Young Dudes\" is also thought of as a [[gay]] anthem.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/mott-the-hoople/biography/ |title=About Mott The Hoople |publisher=MTV |accessdate=2016-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618170556/http://www.mtv.com/artists/mott-the-hoople/biography/ |archive-date=18 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Lou Reed]] said \"It's a Gay Anthem!

In November 1972, Bowie introduced the band on stage at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower]] near [[Philadelphia]] and performed the song with Hunter (released on ''All the Way from Stockholm to Philadelphia'' in 1998 and the expanded version of ''All The Young Dudes'' in 2006).\n\nThe original [[Mott the Hoople]] release had to be changed lyrically in order that it might be played on UK radio and TV. The line in the second verse: \"Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks\" was a reference to UK retailer [[Marks & Spencer]], also known by that colloquialism. As such, air play of the song in its original form would have breached broadcasting regulations relating to advertising in force at the time. The line was replaced with: \"Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars\".\n\nBowie took to performing \"All the Young Dudes\" on his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], and a medley version appears on the album ''[[Ziggy Stardust \u2013 The Motion Picture]]'', the live recording of the last Ziggy show that was finally released officially in 1983. Bowie's first released version of the song was in 1974 on ''[[David Live]]''. Bowie had also offered \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\" to Mott the Hoople following \"All the Young Dudes\", but they turned down this offer, at least partially owing to the then-current success of their own \"[[Honaloochie Boogie]]\".<ref>{{cite book| first= Nicholas | last= Pegg | year= 2016| title= The Complete David Bowie: New Edition: Expanded and Updated | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LqFkDQAAQBAJ | publisher= Titan Books | location= London | isbn= 978-1-7856-5533-3 }}</ref> According to an anecdote by Bowie on the VH1 Storytellers (2009) album (track 7), his annoyance at the rejection prompted Bowie to shave his eyebrows while in Florida.\n\nIn 1992, twenty years after their duet in Philadelphia, Bowie and Hunter again performed the song together with the surviving members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Mick Ronson]], and [[Def Leppard]]'s [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Phil Collen]] at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]. The song was also featured during the [[Outside Tour]] as well as the [[A Reality Tour]], and is included on the [[A Reality Tour (film)|video]] and [[A Reality Tour (album)|audio]] releases of the latter.\n\nBowie's own studio version, recorded in December 1972<ref name=\"Any Day Now p.277\">Kevin Cann (2010). ''Any Day Now \u2013 David Bowie: The London Years: 1947\u20131974'': p.277</ref> during the sessions for ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', went unreleased until 1995 when it appeared in [[Monaural|mono]] on the album ''[[RarestOneBowie]]''. It was subsequently included, again in mono, on ''[[The Best of 1969/1974|The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'', the 2-disc U.S. version of ''[[Best of Bowie]]'', and the 30th Anniversary edition of ''[[Aladdin Sane]]''. A stereo version, which is around a minute shorter than the mono version, circulated unofficially among collectors and finally saw official release in November 2014 on Bowie's ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' compilation set. There also exists a version consisting of the backing track for Mott the Hoople's version with Bowie's guide vocal. A variant of this version, combining Bowie's vocal on the verses with Ian Hunter's on the chorus, was released on the 2006 reissue of ''All the Young Dudes''. Bowie also used the music in reverse as the basis for \"Move On,\" a track on his 1979 album, ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''.\n\n\"All the Young Dudes\" was featured in the 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', the 2007 [[Jason Reitman]] film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' and the 2008 film ''[[The Wackness]]''.

Produced by Bowie, he gave the song to the band after they rejected Bowie's \"[[Suffragette City]]\". Bowie would subsequently record the song himself. Regarded as an anthem of [[glam rock]], the song has received acclaim and was a commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated \"All the Young Dudes\" No. 253 in its list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and on its 2010 update was ranked at number 256. It is also one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\n==Composition==\nRegarded as one of [[glam rock]]'s anthems,<ref name=\"Bowie: The Illustrated Record\"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Betts |first=Stephen |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/mott-the-hoople-all-the-young-dudes-20110526 |title=Mott the Hoople, 'All the Young Dudes' \u2013 500 Greatest Songs of All Time |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2016-01-19 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107031710/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/mott-the-hoople-all-the-young-dudes-20110526 |archive-date=7 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> the song originated after Bowie came into contact with Mott the Hoople's bassist [[Peter Watts (musician)|Peter Watts]] and learned that the band was ready to split due to continued lack of commercial success. When the band rejected his first offer of a composition, \"[[Suffragette City]]\" (which later appeared on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''), Bowie wrote \"All the Young Dudes\" in short order especially for them, allegedly sitting cross-legged on the floor of a room in London's [[Regent Street]], in front of the band's lead singer, [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (2005). ''Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.131</ref> In the 2017 film ''Beside Bowie'', Kevin Cann (author of ''David Bowie: A Chronology'') stated that \"'All the Young Dudes' is David's version of '[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'\", which germinated from Lou Reed lending him a demo of the song.\n\nWith its [[dirge]]-like music, youth suicide references and calls to an imaginary audience, the song bore similarities to Bowie's own \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", the final track from ''Ziggy Stardust''. Described as being to glam rock what \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" was to the [[hippie]] era, the lyrics [[namecheck|name-checked]] contemporary stars [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and contained references to [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] have described the track as \"one of that rare breed: rock songs which hymn the solidarity of the disaffected without distress or sentimentality\".<ref name=\"Bowie: The Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': p.117</ref>\n\nBowie himself once claimed that the song was not intended to be an anthem for glam, that it actually carried a darker message of apocalypse. According to an interview Bowie gave to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, the boys are carrying the same news that the newscaster was carrying in the song \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" from Ziggy Stardust; the news being the fact that the Earth had only five years left to live. Bowie explains: \"All the Young Dudes is a song about this news. It's no hymn to the youth, as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-19740228 | title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman | work=Rolling Stone | date=28 February 1974 | accessdate=27 March 2017 | author=Copetas, Craig | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326224810/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-19740228 | archive-date=26 March 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> \"All the Young Dudes\" is also thought of as a [[gay]] anthem.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/mott-the-hoople/biography/ |title=About Mott The Hoople |publisher=MTV |accessdate=2016-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618170556/http://www.mtv.com/artists/mott-the-hoople/biography/ |archive-date=18 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Lou Reed]] said \"It's a Gay Anthem!

In November 1972, Bowie introduced the band on stage at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower]] near [[Philadelphia]] and performed the song with Hunter (released on ''All the Way from Stockholm to Philadelphia'' in 1998 and the expanded version of ''All The Young Dudes'' in 2006).\n\nThe original [[Mott the Hoople]] release had to be changed lyrically in order that it might be played on UK radio and TV. The line in the second verse: \"Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks\" was a reference to UK retailer [[Marks & Spencer]], also known by that colloquialism. As such, air play of the song in its original form would have breached broadcasting regulations relating to advertising in force at the time. The line was replaced with: \"Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars\".\n\nBowie took to performing \"All the Young Dudes\" on his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], and a medley version appears on the album ''[[Ziggy Stardust \u2013 The Motion Picture]]'', the live recording of the last Ziggy show that was finally released officially in 1983. Bowie's first released version of the song was in 1974 on ''[[David Live]]''. Bowie had also offered \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\" to Mott the Hoople following \"All the Young Dudes\", but they turned down this offer, at least partially owing to the then-current success of their own \"[[Honaloochie Boogie]]\".<ref>{{cite book| first= Nicholas | last= Pegg | year= 2016| title= The Complete David Bowie: New Edition: Expanded and Updated | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LqFkDQAAQBAJ | publisher= Titan Books | location= London | isbn= 978-1-7856-5533-3 }}</ref> According to an anecdote by Bowie on the VH1 Storytellers (2009) album (track 7), his annoyance at the rejection prompted Bowie to shave his eyebrows while in Florida.\n\nIn 1992, twenty years after their duet in Philadelphia, Bowie and Hunter again performed the song together with the surviving members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Mick Ronson]], and [[Def Leppard]]'s [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Phil Collen]] at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]. The song was also featured during the [[Outside Tour]] as well as the [[A Reality Tour]], and is included on the [[A Reality Tour (film)|video]] and [[A Reality Tour (album)|audio]] releases of the latter.\n\nBowie's own studio version, recorded in December 1972<ref name=\"Any Day Now p.277\">Kevin Cann (2010). ''Any Day Now \u2013 David Bowie: The London Years: 1947\u20131974'': p.277</ref> during the sessions for ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', went unreleased until 1995 when it appeared in [[Monaural|mono]] on the album ''[[RarestOneBowie]]''. It was subsequently included, again in mono, on ''[[The Best of 1969/1974|The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'', the 2-disc U.S. version of ''[[Best of Bowie]]'', and the 30th Anniversary edition of ''[[Aladdin Sane]]''. A stereo version, which is around a minute shorter than the mono version, circulated unofficially among collectors and finally saw official release in November 2014 on Bowie's ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' compilation set. There also exists a version consisting of the backing track for Mott the Hoople's version with Bowie's guide vocal. A variant of this version, combining Bowie's vocal on the verses with Ian Hunter's on the chorus, was released on the 2006 reissue of ''All the Young Dudes''. Bowie also used the music in reverse as the basis for \"Move On,\" a track on his 1979 album, ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''.\n\n\"All the Young Dudes\" was featured in the 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', the 2007 [[Jason Reitman]] film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' and the 2008 film ''[[The Wackness]]''.

{"title_page": "Society of American Archivists", "text_new": "The '''Society of American Archivists''' is the oldest and largest [[archivist]] [[Voluntary association|association]] in [[North America]], serving the [[education]]al and [[information]]al needs of more than 5,000 individual archivist and institutional members. Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.archivists.org/about/ | title=SAA: About SAA}}</ref>\n\nThe Society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as [[Encoded Archival Description]], the [[digitizing]] of archival materials, and [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]] and [[art conservation|conservation]] of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Society of American Archivist was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the [[American Historical Association]]. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The [[American Library Association]] created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=J. Frank|date=1983|title=The Blessings of Providence on an Association of Archivists|journal=The American Archivist|volume=46|issue=4|pages=374\u2013399|jstor=40292896|doi=10.17723/aarc.46.4.w7631q465t71h282}}</ref> There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by [[Margaret Cross Norton]] and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland-Swetland|first=Luke|date=1991|title=The Provenance of a Profession: The Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival History|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=54|issue=2|pages=160\u2013175|doi=10.17723/aarc.54.2.w42580v137053675}}</ref> Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first issue of the Society's journal, the [[American Archivist|''American Archivist'',]] appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents.<ref name=\"&quot;Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt to R.D.W. Connor&quot;\">{{cite journal|date=1942|title=News Notes|journal=American Archivist|publisher=Society of American Archivists|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the [[International Council on Archives]] and an archives for the United Nations.<ref name=\":0\" /> A number of committees focused on various interests of the Society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the Society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with [[National Association of State Libraries]] over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.\n\nBy the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists.<ref name=\":1\" /> These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Archives Power: Memory, Accountability, and Social Justice|last=Jimerson|first=Randall|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2009|isbn=978-1-931666-30-5|location=Chicago|pages=76\u2013129}}</ref> There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social historians like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Sam Bass Warner]] brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, a large portion of the Society's focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why.<ref name=\":2\" /> The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella.<ref name=\":2\" /> New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition]]<nowiki/>and a standard for encoding archival [[finding aid]]s, allowing them to be made accessible online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/das|title=Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Curriculum and Certificate Program {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018-2020, which outlined 4 major goal areas for the future. The 4 goal areas are advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members' needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/strategic-plan|title=SAA Strategic Plan {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable ==\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn the 1970s, the SAA began to collaborate with the American Association of Museums and the Association for State and Local History to form a Joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities in Museums, Archives, and Historical Agencies.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hankins|first=Rebecca|date=August 3, 2016|title=Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable (AACR) History|url=|journal=Archivists and Archives of Color Newsletter|volume=|pages=|via=Society of American Archivists}}</ref> Phil Mason and Elsie Freivogel were appointed but outreach to minority members of the SAA was poor. Many minorities were unaware of the Joint Committee and expressed that there had not been any direct communications from the committee's representatives.\n\nThe final report of the SAA Task Force on Diversity states:<blockquote>In 1972 SAA adopted the report of its Committee for the 1970s. Included among the Committee recommendations was a positive injunction to the nominating committee to make the Council more representative of and responsible to the diverse interests of the SAA by considering \"archival interest, age, sex, geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race in the selection of a slate of candidates.\"<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Adkins|first=Elizabeth W.|date=Spring-Summer 2008|title=Our Journey toward Diversity\u2014and a Call to (More) Action|journal=The American Archivist|volume=71|issue=1|pages=21\u201349|jstor=40294493}}</ref></blockquote>Also in the report, \"no person should be nominated as a candidate for an SAA office who, in her or his job, flagrantly espouses or practices discrimination in regard to race, sex, nationality, or political or religious ideology.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1978, the SAA established a joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities. However, the group languished in part from a lack of funds.\n\n=== 1980s: Task Force ===\nThe Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable began as a Task Force on Minorities within the SAA.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 1981, archivists Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Paula Williams drafted a resolution for the task force and members of the SAA approved the group.  Thomas Battle, who also chaired the SAA's Diversity Committee, was appointed the chairman of the Task Force and John Fleckner, Archie Motley, Daniel T. Williams, and Paula Williams were appointed members.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was chosen as the SAA representative for the Joint Committee on Minority Recruitment, replacing Phil Mason.\n\nIn the beginning, members noticed that the task force didn't have much representation. In an interview with AACR History, Karen Jefferson stated:<blockquote>\u201cAt the beginning of the minorities task force Native Americans, people of Latin American and Caribbean descent; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender were included under the umbrella of minorities. Although minorities share some broad experiences as minorities, each group has unique concerns specific to their culture and experience.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>It wasn't until 1982 that a representative of Hispanic archivists was appointed: Idilio Garicia Pena. In its six years of existence, the task force made several recommendations to the SAA Council. These recommendations eventually became the foundation of the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable, and they still pusue them today. Some of their recommendations were to:<blockquote>\u25cf  Develop a roster of minorities working in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a membership committee to help in recruitment efforts for the Society.\n\n\u25cf  Develop a policy statement regarding recruitment of minorities.\n\n\u25cf  Develop an organizational handbook to increase membership\u2019s knowledge of the Society\u2019s structure and functions.\n\n\u25cf  Provide orientation for new members at the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Lower introductory dues rates for new members.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a single-day registration fee for the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Seek funds to develop programs to address needs of minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Financially support SAA\u2019s own activities that are designed to address issues related to minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a scholarship or fellowship to support the development of minorities in the profession.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=2016-08-25|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>Many of these goals were met and the creation of the task force proved immediately to be a vehicle for broader minority participation in the SAA, especially in leadership.\n\n=== 1980s: Roundtable ===\nIn 1987, the task force dissembled, restricted in their effectiveness because of a lack of interest and support from the SAA. The task force made the recommendation that a roundtable be created for minorities, which was formed the same year. Nine SAA members helped to found the roundtable: Diana Lachatanere, Wilda Logan, Carol Rudisell, Karen Jefferson, Ervin Jordan, Clifford Muse, Thomas Battle, Jo Ellen El-Bashir, and Brenda Banks.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Carol Rudisell served as the coordinators. In September 1987, the AACR held their first meeting in New York City at the annual SAA conference. At this meeting, the structure of the roundtable was adopted with two co-chairs, one elected annually with elections every year.<ref name=\":02\" /> Their first year, Carol Rudisell and Donna Wells co-chaired while Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was elected as chair of the Manuscript Section, declining to serve as co-chair.\n\nIt was not required to be a member of the SAA in order to participate in the roundtable. This allowed for a freer space in which the roundtable could interact with more minorities among the archival profession. But SAA membership would be encouraged and the chairpersons were required to be SAA members in good standing.\n\nThere was a lengthy debate on the name of the roundtable, varying from Minorities Roundtable to African American and Third World Archivists Roundtable. In 1994, the name was chosen to be the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Newsletter & Directory ====\nIn 1987, the roundtable began publishing a newsletter through the SAA, although not without objections from society members on costs. Thomas Battle then proposed that [[Howard University]] would completely fund the newsletter and even publish and distribute it for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/wilda-d-logan/|title=Wilda D. Logan|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> These newsletters were available to anyone who was interested in African American archives, manuscripts and collections. In less than a year, Battle returned to the SAA with a high percentage of popularity and interest in the newsletter among not just African Americans but all archivists. This newsletter continued to be funded by Howard University and was later used as a model for other roundtables of the SAA.\n\nLachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Rudisell were the first editors and after the first year, Karen Jefferson and Ruth Hill edited the newsletter. Other editors over the years include Kathryn Neal, Cathy Lynn Mundale, and Jo Ellen El-Bashir, who served one of the longest tenures as editor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2003, under editor Rose Roberta, the newsletter became available electronically and continues to be published online. Today, the newsletter continues to be the main source of communication for the roundtable members. The newsletter provides information on different members, institutions, the SAA, archives, and the activities and achievements of the roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn 1991, Carol Rudisell compiled the first membership directory with racial/ethnic heritage listed for the members. In 1996, this was compiled by Karen Jefferson in the ''Archivists of Color Directory''.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is not a directory on the entire membership of the roundtable but a directory of the archivists of color involved in the AACR. Each archivist has a brief biography, including their education, experience and the institutions they are affiliated with. In 2012, a directory was listed on the AACR website including only the name, job title and contact information of the archivist.\n\n==== Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award ====\nSeveral members of the roundtable, including [[Wilda Logan]], helped to establish the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award in 1993. This award is given to recognize graduate students of color who are actively working toward becoming professional archivists in the SAA.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/archivesandpublichistory/2010/01/15/harold-t-pinkett-minority-student-award/|title=Harold T.

Pinkett]] who was the first African American archivist to serve at the National Archives.<ref name=\":22\" /> The SAA Council acknowledged the contributions of Harold T. Pinkett in this resolution:<blockquote>Whereas, Harold T. Pinkett served with distinction during his long tenure at the National Archives and Records Service; and Whereas Harold T. Pinkett has been a scholar, archival educator, and mentor who has made important contributions to the archives profession; Therefore be it resolved that in recognition of his lifetime achievements and contributions to the archival profession, the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable supports the renaming of the SAA Minority Student Award to the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award.</blockquote>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness (TFOE) was appointed in 1995-1996. One of the main issues of the task force was to address diversity in the SAA as well as in the archival profession.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this came the creation of the Task Force on Diversity, chaired by Brenda Banks with members Anne Difffendal, John Fleckner, Susan Fox, [[Karen Jefferson]], Deborah King (Burns), Joan Krizak, and [[Kathleen D. Roe|Kathleen Roe]]. The task force investigated the SAA to see where they supported or weakened diversity, discussing possible solutions to improve or encourage it in the SAA as well as the archival profession. Their final report recommended that the SAA:<blockquote>\n* Develop an organizational position statement that articulates SAA\u2019s commitment to becoming a more diverse organization\n* Incorporate diversity into SAA\u2019s strategic planning process.\n* Reinforce and expand existing activities within SAA that support diversity.\n* Identify and establish new initiatives that may assist SAA in its efforts to become a more diverse organization.<ref name=\":02\" />   \n</blockquote>After the Council accepted the report, they approved a statement on diversity that was released on June 13, 1999:<blockquote>The Society of American Archivists is committed to integrating diversity concerns and perspectives into all aspects of the activities and into the fabric of the profession as a whole.  SAA is also committed to the goal of a Society membership that reflects the broad diversity of American society.  SAA believes that these commitments are essential to the effective pursuit of the archival mission \u201cto ensure the identification, preservation, and use the nation\u2019s historical record.<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>Five years later, the SAA Council established a Committee on Diversity in response to complaints that they were moving slowly in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Diversity. After much debate, they established a Task Force on Diversity with its first goal to define 'diversity.'<ref name=\":32\" /> They were also asked to investigate \"how and to what extent issues of democracy are being addressed by the Society.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> The Task Force on Diversity submitted its last report in February 1999. In 1996, one of the few articles written on diversity in the archives profession was published. Kathryn M. Neal details the importance of diversity in archives:<blockquote>Expanding the numbers of staff members of color and tapping their potential should (and no doubt would) enhance the overall functions of archives and manuscript repositories. New ideas would likely be stimulated in areas that include, but certainly are not limited to, donor relations (for instance, how to approach and document members of growing communities of color most effectively) and reference/access (determining how to improve services as user groups become increasingly diverse, or how to attract a more diverse pool of researchers if society's changing demographics are not reflected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neal|first=Kathryn M.|date=1996|title=The Importance of Being Diverse: The Archival Profession and Minority Recruitment|url=|journal=Archival Issues|volume=|pages=145\u2013158|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Today ===\nMany of the original goals of the roundtable exist today. On their website, they have stated their purposes as to \"identify and address the concerns of archivists of African, Asian, Latino and Native American descent; promote wider participation of said archivists in the archival profession; and promote the preservation of archival materials that pertain to people of color.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, the roundtable still recognizes the need for more to be done for minorities, especially in archives. In a report made after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the AACR stated: \"As archivists, we cannot accept invisibility. As a profession, we cannot continue to accept historical erasure and whitewashing through binary historical practices.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuesandadvocacy.wordpress.com/tag/archivists-and-archives-of-color-roundtable/|title=LEADERS OF AACR, LACCHA, LAGAR ON ORLANDO & ARCHIVISTS' ROLE IN CREATING A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of American Archivists: Issues and Advocacy|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the SAA Council created a subcommittee to see the status of the SAA's diversity efforts. In May 2003, they reported that some of the recommendations by the Task Force on Diversity had been addressed while others had not, and the actions had not been effectively reported back to SAA members.<ref name=\":32\" /> The Council then voted for a Committee on Diversity. In August 2003, the Council approved the committee:<blockquote>The SAA Committee on Diversity works to ensure that the organization's services, activities, policies, communications, and products support the goal of a more diverse SAA and professional archival community. It functions as a catalyst for new diversity-related initiatives, developed in coordination with various SAA entities, and as the organization's \"conscience\" in monitoring, evaluating, advocating, and reporting on matters pertaining to the diversity of archival practitioners and documentation.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>In 2007, Elizabeth W. Adkins gave her presidential address at the SAA Annual Meeting in Chicago and highlighted the importance of diversity. \"SAA has been working to address diversity concerns for more than thirty-five years, sometimes effectively and sometimes not so effectively.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In her speech, she focused on SAA's definition of diversity in comparison to others and how they have progressed.\n\nAdkins states that in 1982, only 2.8% of archivists were nonwhite but in 2004, that number jumped to 7%.<ref name=\":32\" /> SAA is only slightly better with about 10% of its members identifying as part of a minority or ethnic group. Adkins compares this with the national population, which is about 25% of nonwhite people, claiming \"both SAA and the profession have a very long way to go to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> But it's a start.\n\nSince 2002, Council meetings and discussion have consistently focused on diversity. Some of the approved motions on diversity from these meetings are:<blockquote>\u2022 Diversity has been and will be incorporated into every Council agenda for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 The Council, SAA staff, and all SAA units must report on diversity initiatives.\n\n\u2022 The president-elect and the Appointments Committee are required to report on the demographics of all committee appointments and on what was done to seek diversity in committee appointments.\n\n\u2022 The Program Committee and Host Committee must report on efforts to address diversity issues in the planning and scheduling of annual meeting programming.\n\n\u2022 The Diversity Committee has been asked to provide a report on the state of diversity at the annual business meeting each year.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Women Archivists Section (WArS) ==\nThe Women Archivists Roundtable (WAR) monitors the status of women archivists and promotes the participation of women in the archives profession, specifically in areas of the Society of American Archivists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/women-archivists-section|title=Women Archivists Section {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nAlthough many women archivists helped shaped the SAA, the status of women in the archival profession didn't receive much attention until the 1970s.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://womenarchivistsroundtable.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2013-10-03|website=Women Archivists Section|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1972, the SAA established the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. The Committee sought to address under representation and identify the barriers and obstacles for advancement.<ref name=\":03\" /> The overall membership population of women had grown since the SAA's inception, but few had risen to the positions of president, officer, or council member.\n\nThe Committee conducted two surveys, one of archivists and one of directors. Through these surveys, the Committee discovered that although many women had comparable education and experience, few of them had risen to administrative positions.<ref>Deutrich, Mabel E. \u201cWomen in Archives: A Summary Report of the Committee of the Status of Women in the Archival Profession.\u201d ''The American Archivist 38'' (1975): 43-46.</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the Committee was created, the Women's Caucus was founded and began publishing ''The SAA Women's Caucus Newsletter''.<ref>Pacifico, Michele F. \u201cFounding Mothers: Women in the Society of American Archivist, 1936-1972.\u201d ''The American Archivist 50'' (1987): 389.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Committee evolved into the Women's Professional Archival Issues Roundtable.

Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.archivists.org/about/ | title=SAA: About SAA}}</ref>\n\nThe Society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as [[Encoded Archival Description]], the [[digitizing]] of archival materials, and [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]] and [[art conservation|conservation]] of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Society of American Archivist was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the [[American Historical Association]]. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The [[American Library Association]] created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=J. Frank|date=1983|title=The Blessings of Providence on an Association of Archivists|journal=The American Archivist|volume=46|issue=4|pages=374\u2013399|jstor=40292896|doi=10.17723/aarc.46.4.w7631q465t71h282}}</ref> There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by [[Margaret Cross Norton]] and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland-Swetland|first=Luke|date=1991|title=The Provenance of a Profession: The Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival History|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=54|issue=2|pages=160\u2013175|doi=10.17723/aarc.54.2.w42580v137053675}}</ref> Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first issue of the Society's journal, the [[American Archivist|''American Archivist'',]] appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents.<ref name=\"&quot;Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt to R.D.W. Connor&quot;\">{{cite journal|date=1942|title=News Notes|journal=American Archivist|publisher=Society of American Archivists|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the [[International Council on Archives]] and an archives for the United Nations.<ref name=\":0\" /> A number of committees focused on various interests of the Society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the Society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with [[National Association of State Libraries]] over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.\n\nBy the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists.<ref name=\":1\" /> These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Archives Power: Memory, Accountability, and Social Justice|last=Jimerson|first=Randall|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2009|isbn=978-1-931666-30-5|location=Chicago|pages=76\u2013129}}</ref> There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social historians like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Sam Bass Warner]] brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, a large portion of the Society's focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why.<ref name=\":2\" /> The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella.<ref name=\":2\" /> New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition]]<nowiki/>and a standard for encoding archival [[finding aid]]s, allowing them to be made accessible online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/das|title=Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Curriculum and Certificate Program {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018-2020, which outlined 4 major goal areas for the future. The 4 goal areas are advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members' needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/strategic-plan|title=SAA Strategic Plan {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable ==\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn the 1970s, the SAA began to collaborate with the American Association of Museums and the Association for State and Local History to form a Joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities in Museums, Archives, and Historical Agencies.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hankins|first=Rebecca|date=August 3, 2016|title=Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable (AACR) History|url=|journal=Archivists and Archives of Color Newsletter|volume=|pages=|via=Society of American Archivists}}</ref> Phil Mason and Elsie Freivogel were appointed but outreach to minority members of the SAA was poor. Many minorities were unaware of the Joint Committee and expressed that there had not been any direct communications from the committee's representatives.\n\nThe final report of the SAA Task Force on Diversity states:<blockquote>In 1972 SAA adopted the report of its Committee for the 1970s. Included among the Committee recommendations was a positive injunction to the nominating committee to make the Council more representative of and responsible to the diverse interests of the SAA by considering \"archival interest, age, sex, geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race in the selection of a slate of candidates.\"<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Adkins|first=Elizabeth W.|date=Spring-Summer 2008|title=Our Journey toward Diversity\u2014and a Call to (More) Action|journal=The American Archivist|volume=71|issue=1|pages=21\u201349|jstor=40294493}}</ref></blockquote>Also in the report, \"no person should be nominated as a candidate for an SAA office who, in her or his job, flagrantly espouses or practices discrimination in regard to race, sex, nationality, or political or religious ideology.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1978, the SAA established a joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities. However, the group languished in part from a lack of funds.\n\n=== 1980s: Task Force ===\nThe Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable began as a Task Force on Minorities within the SAA.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 1981, archivists Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Paula Williams drafted a resolution for the task force and members of the SAA approved the group.  Thomas Battle, who also chaired the SAA's Diversity Committee, was appointed the chairman of the Task Force and John Fleckner, Archie Motley, Daniel T. Williams, and Paula Williams were appointed members.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was chosen as the SAA representative for the Joint Committee on Minority Recruitment, replacing Phil Mason.\n\nIn the beginning, members noticed that the task force didn't have much representation. In an interview with AACR History, Karen Jefferson stated:<blockquote>\u201cAt the beginning of the minorities task force Native Americans, people of Latin American and Caribbean descent; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender were included under the umbrella of minorities. Although minorities share some broad experiences as minorities, each group has unique concerns specific to their culture and experience.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>It wasn't until 1982 that a representative of Hispanic archivists was appointed: Idilio Garicia Pena. In its six years of existence, the task force made several recommendations to the SAA Council. These recommendations eventually became the foundation of the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable, and they still pusue them today. Some of their recommendations were to:<blockquote>\u25cf  Develop a roster of minorities working in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a membership committee to help in recruitment efforts for the Society.\n\n\u25cf  Develop a policy statement regarding recruitment of minorities.\n\n\u25cf  Develop an organizational handbook to increase membership\u2019s knowledge of the Society\u2019s structure and functions.\n\n\u25cf  Provide orientation for new members at the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Lower introductory dues rates for new members.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a single-day registration fee for the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Seek funds to develop programs to address needs of minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Financially support SAA\u2019s own activities that are designed to address issues related to minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a scholarship or fellowship to support the development of minorities in the profession.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=2016-08-25|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>Many of these goals were met and the creation of the task force proved immediately to be a vehicle for broader minority participation in the SAA, especially in leadership.\n\n=== 1980s: Roundtable ===\nIn 1987, the task force dissembled, restricted in their effectiveness because of a lack of interest and support from the SAA. The task force made the recommendation that a roundtable be created for minorities, which was formed the same year. Nine SAA members helped to found the roundtable: Diana Lachatanere, Wilda Logan, Carol Rudisell, Karen Jefferson, Ervin Jordan, Clifford Muse, Thomas Battle, Jo Ellen El-Bashir, and Brenda Banks.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Carol Rudisell served as the coordinators. In September 1987, the AACR held their first meeting in New York City at the annual SAA conference. At this meeting, the structure of the roundtable was adopted with two co-chairs, one elected annually with elections every year.<ref name=\":02\" /> Their first year, Carol Rudisell and Donna Wells co-chaired while Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was elected as chair of the Manuscript Section, declining to serve as co-chair.\n\nIt was not required to be a member of the SAA in order to participate in the roundtable. This allowed for a freer space in which the roundtable could interact with more minorities among the archival profession. But SAA membership would be encouraged and the chairpersons were required to be SAA members in good standing.\n\nThere was a lengthy debate on the name of the roundtable, varying from Minorities Roundtable to African American and Third World Archivists Roundtable. In 1994, the name was chosen to be the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Newsletter & Directory ====\nIn 1987, the roundtable began publishing a newsletter through the SAA, although not without objections from society members on costs. Thomas Battle then proposed that [[Howard University]] would completely fund the newsletter and even publish and distribute it for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/wilda-d-logan/|title=Wilda D. Logan|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> These newsletters were available to anyone who was interested in African American archives, manuscripts and collections. In less than a year, Battle returned to the SAA with a high percentage of popularity and interest in the newsletter among not just African Americans but all archivists. This newsletter continued to be funded by Howard University and was later used as a model for other roundtables of the SAA.\n\nLachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Rudisell were the first editors and after the first year, Karen Jefferson and Ruth Hill edited the newsletter. Other editors over the years include Kathryn Neal, Cathy Lynn Mundale, and Jo Ellen El-Bashir, who served one of the longest tenures as editor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2003, under editor Rose Roberta, the newsletter became available electronically and continues to be published online. Today, the newsletter continues to be the main source of communication for the roundtable members. The newsletter provides information on different members, institutions, the SAA, archives, and the activities and achievements of the roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn 1991, Carol Rudisell compiled the first membership directory with racial/ethnic heritage listed for the members. In 1996, this was compiled by Karen Jefferson in the ''Archivists of Color Directory''.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is not a directory on the entire membership of the roundtable but a directory of the archivists of color involved in the AACR. Each archivist has a brief biography, including their education, experience and the institutions they are affiliated with. In 2012, a directory was listed on the AACR website including only the name, job title and contact information of the archivist.\n\n==== Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award ====\nSeveral members of the roundtable, including [[Wilda Logan]], helped to establish the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award in 1993. This award is given to recognize graduate students of color who are actively working toward becoming professional archivists in the SAA.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/archivesandpublichistory/2010/01/15/harold-t-pinkett-minority-student-award/|title=Harold T.

Pinkett]] who was the first African American archivist to serve at the National Archives.<ref name=\":22\" /> The SAA Council acknowledged the contributions of Harold T. Pinkett in this resolution:<blockquote>Whereas, Harold T. Pinkett served with distinction during his long tenure at the National Archives and Records Service; and Whereas Harold T. Pinkett has been a scholar, archival educator, and mentor who has made important contributions to the archives profession; Therefore be it resolved that in recognition of his lifetime achievements and contributions to the archival profession, the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable supports the renaming of the SAA Minority Student Award to the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award.</blockquote>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness (TFOE) was appointed in 1995-1996. One of the main issues of the task force was to address diversity in the SAA as well as in the archival profession.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this came the creation of the Task Force on Diversity, chaired by Brenda Banks with members Anne Difffendal, John Fleckner, Susan Fox, [[Karen Jefferson]], Deborah King (Burns), Joan Krizak, and [[Kathleen D. Roe|Kathleen Roe]]. The task force investigated the SAA to see where they supported or weakened diversity, discussing possible solutions to improve or encourage it in the SAA as well as the archival profession. Their final report recommended that the SAA:<blockquote>\n* Develop an organizational position statement that articulates SAA\u2019s commitment to becoming a more diverse organization\n* Incorporate diversity into SAA\u2019s strategic planning process.\n* Reinforce and expand existing activities within SAA that support diversity.\n* Identify and establish new initiatives that may assist SAA in its efforts to become a more diverse organization.<ref name=\":02\" />   \n</blockquote>After the Council accepted the report, they approved a statement on diversity that was released on June 13, 1999:<blockquote>The Society of American Archivists is committed to integrating diversity concerns and perspectives into all aspects of the activities and into the fabric of the profession as a whole.  SAA is also committed to the goal of a Society membership that reflects the broad diversity of American society.  SAA believes that these commitments are essential to the effective pursuit of the archival mission \u201cto ensure the identification, preservation, and use the nation\u2019s historical record.<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>Five years later, the SAA Council established a Committee on Diversity in response to complaints that they were moving slowly in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Diversity. After much debate, they established a Task Force on Diversity with its first goal to define 'diversity.'<ref name=\":32\" /> They were also asked to investigate \"how and to what extent issues of democracy are being addressed by the Society.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> The Task Force on Diversity submitted its last report in February 1999. In 1996, one of the few articles written on diversity in the archives profession was published. Kathryn M. Neal details the importance of diversity in archives:<blockquote>Expanding the numbers of staff members of color and tapping their potential should (and no doubt would) enhance the overall functions of archives and manuscript repositories. New ideas would likely be stimulated in areas that include, but certainly are not limited to, donor relations (for instance, how to approach and document members of growing communities of color most effectively) and reference/access (determining how to improve services as user groups become increasingly diverse, or how to attract a more diverse pool of researchers if society's changing demographics are not reflected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neal|first=Kathryn M.|date=1996|title=The Importance of Being Diverse: The Archival Profession and Minority Recruitment|url=|journal=Archival Issues|volume=|pages=145\u2013158|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Today ===\nMany of the original goals of the roundtable exist today. On their website, they have stated their purposes as to \"identify and address the concerns of archivists of African, Asian, Latino and Native American descent; promote wider participation of said archivists in the archival profession; and promote the preservation of archival materials that pertain to people of color.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, the roundtable still recognizes the need for more to be done for minorities, especially in archives. In a report made after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the AACR stated: \"As archivists, we cannot accept invisibility. As a profession, we cannot continue to accept historical erasure and whitewashing through binary historical practices.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuesandadvocacy.wordpress.com/tag/archivists-and-archives-of-color-roundtable/|title=LEADERS OF AACR, LACCHA, LAGAR ON ORLANDO & ARCHIVISTS' ROLE IN CREATING A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of American Archivists: Issues and Advocacy|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the SAA Council created a subcommittee to see the status of the SAA's diversity efforts. In May 2003, they reported that some of the recommendations by the Task Force on Diversity had been addressed while others had not, and the actions had not been effectively reported back to SAA members.<ref name=\":32\" /> The Council then voted for a Committee on Diversity. In August 2003, the Council approved the committee:<blockquote>The SAA Committee on Diversity works to ensure that the organization's services, activities, policies, communications, and products support the goal of a more diverse SAA and professional archival community. It functions as a catalyst for new diversity-related initiatives, developed in coordination with various SAA entities, and as the organization's \"conscience\" in monitoring, evaluating, advocating, and reporting on matters pertaining to the diversity of archival practitioners and documentation.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>In 2007, Elizabeth W. Adkins gave her presidential address at the SAA Annual Meeting in Chicago and highlighted the importance of diversity. \"SAA has been working to address diversity concerns for more than thirty-five years, sometimes effectively and sometimes not so effectively.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In her speech, she focused on SAA's definition of diversity in comparison to others and how they have progressed.\n\nAdkins states that in 1982, only 2.8% of archivists were nonwhite but in 2004, that number jumped to 7%.<ref name=\":32\" /> SAA is only slightly better with about 10% of its members identifying as part of a minority or ethnic group. Adkins compares this with the national population, which is about 25% of nonwhite people, claiming \"both SAA and the profession have a very long way to go to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> But it's a start.\n\nSince 2002, Council meetings and discussion have consistently focused on diversity. Some of the approved motions on diversity from these meetings are:<blockquote>\u2022 Diversity has been and will be incorporated into every Council agenda for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 The Council, SAA staff, and all SAA units must report on diversity initiatives.\n\n\u2022 The president-elect and the Appointments Committee are required to report on the demographics of all committee appointments and on what was done to seek diversity in committee appointments.\n\n\u2022 The Program Committee and Host Committee must report on efforts to address diversity issues in the planning and scheduling of annual meeting programming.\n\n\u2022 The Diversity Committee has been asked to provide a report on the state of diversity at the annual business meeting each year.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Women Archivists Section (WArS) ==\nThe Women Archivists Roundtable (WAR) monitors the status of women archivists and promotes the participation of women in the archives profession, specifically in areas of the Society of American Archivists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/women-archivists-section|title=Women Archivists Section {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nAlthough many women archivists helped shaped the SAA, the status of women in the archival profession didn't receive much attention until the 1970s.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://womenarchivistsroundtable.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2013-10-03|website=Women Archivists Section|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1972, the SAA established the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. The Committee sought to address under representation and identify the barriers and obstacles for advancement.<ref name=\":03\" /> The overall membership population of women had grown since the SAA's inception, but few had risen to the positions of president, officer, or council member.\n\nThe Committee conducted two surveys, one of archivists and one of directors. Through these surveys, the Committee discovered that although many women had comparable education and experience, few of them had risen to administrative positions.<ref>Deutrich, Mabel E. \u201cWomen in Archives: A Summary Report of the Committee of the Status of Women in the Archival Profession.\u201d ''The American Archivist 38'' (1975): 43-46.</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the Committee was created, the Women's Caucus was founded and began publishing ''The SAA Women's Caucus Newsletter''.<ref>Pacifico, Michele F. \u201cFounding Mothers: Women in the Society of American Archivist, 1936-1972.\u201d ''The American Archivist 50'' (1987): 389.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Committee evolved into the Women's Professional Archival Issues Roundtable.

In late December 2016, Twitch announced the launch of the IRL section, allowing Denino to stream without the involvement of gaming for the first time.

At that time we also had the financial resources to do it. This was like our second breakthrough in a way; ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998) broke us, took us to the big league. Musically it was pretty laid-back from our side because everyone involved in the orchestra really knew their stuff, so we basically spent two days lying on the couch hearing all these people playing our songs, enjoying every moment. It was one of the most amazing experiences in my life. The first song they started to play was \"Ghost Love Score\", we had no idea what to expect, and I just thought: This can't be happening!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruskell |first1=Nick |title=[[Kerrang!]] |chapter=Treausre Chest.

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album; unlike ''[[Century Child]]'', Nightwish chose an orchestra outside of Finland, the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], which has been featured on every album released since.\n\n''Once'' is their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, \"[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]\". The band added new elements to their music for this album, such as the chorus [[riff]] and synthesized drum-beat of \"Wish I Had an Angel\", and a long prayer chant on \"Creek Mary's Blood\".<ref name=Ovington>Ovington, Jacob, \"[http://www.dark-domain.co.uk/2013/01/john-two-hawks-denies-allegations-that.html Nightwish collaborator denies allegations that his Oglala heritage is false] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006123952/http://www.dark-domain.co.uk/2013/01/john-two-hawks-denies-allegations-that.html |date=6 October 2015 }}\" in ''The Dark Domain'', 17 January 2013.

At that time we also had the financial resources to do it. This was like our second breakthrough in a way; ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998) broke us, took us to the big league. Musically it was pretty laid-back from our side because everyone involved in the orchestra really knew their stuff, so we basically spent two days lying on the couch hearing all these people playing our songs, enjoying every moment. It was one of the most amazing experiences in my life. The first song they started to play was \"Ghost Love Score\", we had no idea what to expect, and I just thought: This can't be happening!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruskell |first1=Nick |title=[[Kerrang!]] |chapter=Treausre Chest.

It features a group of four potatoes who sing songs. The series is written and directed by [[Josh Selig]], creator of ''[[Oobi (TV series)|Oobi]]'', ''[[Wonder Pets]]'' and ''[[3rd & Bird]]''. The \"Small Potatoes\" series is currently airing on [[CBeebies]] in the UK, [[ABC 4 Kids]] in Australia and on the [[Disney Junior]] channel in the United States. The series was followed by a motion picture in 2013, [[Meet the Small Potatoes]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nThe series features four potatoes: Olaf, Ruby, Nate, and Chip. Simon Snail, a monocled snail with a top hat, has also appeared twice in the series, and is referred to by this name in the episode \"Imagination\" and \"Chip's Theme\".\n\n===Olaf===\nOlaf is very plump. (Please update this when lyrics for all the songs come out, i'm having a hard time understanding his verse in Small Potato Rock.)\n\n===Nate===\nNate is very long and skinny, he likes jazz music and poetry.\n\n===Chip===\nChip is a perfectly normal shaped potato. He is pretty shy, but if you get a chance to know him, he's pretty sweet.\n\n===Ruby===\nRuby is the lead singer in most songs and is a small orange potato.\n\n===Baby Potato===\nBaby Potato (Ruby's sister) joins in halfway through the series, and is seen in \"Moon Baby\", \"Potatoes At Heart\", and \"Christmas Baby\". ==Crew==\n* Composers: [[Jerry Bock]]<ref name=2011-04-08-kidscreen>{{cite news|last=Goldman Getzler|first=Wendy|title=Small Potatoes smallpotatoes ruined art\n|url=http://kidscreen.com/2011/04/18/small-potatoes-continues-to-grow/|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=kidscreen|date=18 April 2011|location=Toronto ON}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It features a group of four potatoes who sing songs. The series is written and directed by [[Josh Selig]], creator of ''[[Oobi (TV series)|Oobi]]'', ''[[Wonder Pets]]'' and ''[[3rd & Bird]]''. The \"Small Potatoes\" series is currently airing on [[CBeebies]] in the UK, [[ABC 4 Kids]] in Australia and on the [[Disney Junior]] channel in the United States. The series was followed by a motion picture in 2013, [[Meet the Small Potatoes]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nThe series features four potatoes: Olaf, Ruby, Nate, and Chip. Simon Snail, a monocled snail with a top hat, has also appeared twice in the series, and is referred to by this name in the episode \"Imagination\" and \"Chip's Theme\".\n\n===Olaf===\nOlaf is very plump. (Please update this when lyrics for all the songs come out, i'm having a hard time understanding his verse in Small Potato Rock.)\n\n===Nate===\nNate is very long and skinny, he likes jazz music and poetry.\n\n===Chip===\nChip is a perfectly normal shaped potato. He is pretty shy, but if you get a chance to know him, he's pretty sweet.\n\n===Ruby===\nRuby is the lead singer in most songs and is a small orange potato.\n\n===Baby Potato===\nBaby Potato (Ruby's sister) joins in halfway through the series, and is seen in \"Moon Baby\", \"Potatoes At Heart\", and \"Christmas Baby\". ==Crew==\n* Composers: [[Jerry Bock]]<ref name=2011-04-08-kidscreen>{{cite news|last=Goldman Getzler|first=Wendy|title=Small Potatoes smallpotatoes ruined art\n|url=http://kidscreen.com/2011/04/18/small-potatoes-continues-to-grow/|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=kidscreen|date=18 April 2011|location=Toronto ON}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
