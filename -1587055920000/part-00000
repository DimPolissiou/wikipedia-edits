He has also worked for [[ESPN]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], including [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Baseball]], [[college football]], and the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|Frozen Four]] hockey tournament.

Thorne eventually found courtrooms dull compared to broadcasting.\n\nThorne's son-in-law, Damian DiGiulian, is a former [[Coach (sport)|assistant coach]] for the [[University of Vermont]] hockey team; Maine (Thorne's [[alma mater]]) and Vermont are rivals in the [[Hockey East]] conference of [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] hockey. DiGiulian is now a color commentator for ESPNU's college hockey broadcasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n\n===Baseball===\n\nIn {{baseball year|1985}}, Thorne began a four-year stint as a radio announcer for the [[New York Mets]]. Thorne was present in the booth at [[Shea Stadium]], along with [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]], for the now-famous sixth game of the [[1986 World Series]] between the [[1986 New York Mets season|Mets]] and [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Thorne was one of the first to criticize the Red Sox for leaving ill-fated Red Sox first baseman [[Bill Buckner]] in the 10th inning of the game over [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]].\n\nHe has been the play-by-play TV announcer for the [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]]'s [[Baltimore Orioles]] games since [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|2007]]. He is known for his signature calls of ''\"Goodbye! Home run!\"'' and ''\"Mercy!\"''  He prefers to use \"two-RBI home run\" and \"three-RBI home run\" rather than the more standard \"two-run home run\" and \"three-run homer\" phrases, despite the fact that the Orioles are famous for [[Earl Weaver]]'s praise of \"pitching, defense and three-run homers\" as a recipe for success. Thorne closes his Orioles broadcasts with \"Adieu\" if the Orioles lose or \"Adieu-Adieu\" if they win.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voices: Gary Thorne (LL.M.'76) |url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/voices-gary-thorne-ll-m-76/ |website=Law.Georgetown.edu |publisher=Georgetown University |accessdate=August 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190612185744/https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/voices-gary-thorne-ll-m-76/ |archive-date=June 12, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====National work====\nIn {{baseball year|1989}}, Thorne was named a backup play-by-play announcer (behind [[Al Michaels]] and replacing [[Gary Bender]] in this particular capacity) for [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s [[Major League Baseball on ABC|coverage]] of ''[[Thursday Night Baseball]]'' telecasts with [[Joe Morgan]].

Thorne has also worked on one of ESPN Radio's postseason [[Division Series]] crews each year, and (as previously mentioned) called the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]] for non-U.S. viewers via MLB International television.\n\nThorne officially replaced [[Dave O'Brien (sportscaster)|Dave O'Brien]] on the MLB International broadcasts of the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] (even-numbered years), [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] (odd-numbered years), and the [[World Series]] from [[2010 World Series|2010]]-[[2014 World Series|2014]] alongside Rick Sutcliffe.

Thorne rose to prominence in Maine broadcasting, when he began calling play-by-play for the University of Maine's hockey games for Bangor [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] WABI. As the voice of the Black Bears, he quickly became one of the most recognizable radio voices in the state.\n\nThorne was asked to call Maine hockey games during winter months until 1987 (simultaneously with his work for the Mets in the summer from 1985) when the lure of doing play-by-play in the NHL became too strong for Thorne to ignore.

I think that\u2019s the word I used most often in the last three days, fun, because that\u2019s how I think of this. It\u2019s a wonderful event. It\u2019s great to see the kids play.

Thorne, Clement, and John Davidson called both Stanley Cup wins from {{scfy|2003}} through {{scfy|2004}}. He called the end of two long-running Stanley Cup droughts, in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] for the [[New York Rangers]] and [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] for the [[Detroit Red Wings]].\n\nHe was named to call the play-by-play of [[USA Hockey|Team USA's]] games in the [[2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] for the [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] alongside Dave Starman.

It was all for PR.\" Thorne later said that Mirabelli had only been joking. \"He said one thing, and I heard something else. I reported what I heard and what I honestly felt was said,\" Thorne said. \"Having talked with him today, there's no doubt in my mind that's not what he said, that's not what he meant. He explained that it was in the context of the sarcasm and the jabbing that goes on in the clubhouse. \"I took it as something serious, and it wasn't,\" Thorne said. Mirabelli confirmed the story, saying, \"He knows that I believe 100 percent that I thought the sock had blood on it. It never crossed my mind that there wasn't blood on that sock. If he misinterpreted something said inside the clubhouse, it's unfortunate.\" Mirabelli said he spoke with Thorne in the Boston clubhouse about six months after the 2004 playoffs. \"As he was walking away he asked, 'How about the bloody sock?' I said, 'Yeah, we got a lot of publicity out of that,' and that was all he can recall me saying,\" Mirabelli said. \"He said he assumed what I meant was that the sock was fake and that it was just a publicity stunt. That by no means is what I meant.

Thorne rose to prominence in Maine broadcasting, when he began calling play-by-play for the University of Maine's hockey games for Bangor [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] WABI. As the voice of the Black Bears, he quickly became one of the most recognizable radio voices in the state.\n\nThorne was asked to call Maine hockey games during winter months until 1987 (simultaneously with his work for the Mets in the summer from 1985) when the lure of doing play-by-play in the NHL became too strong for Thorne to ignore. From [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987]]&ndash;[[1992\u201393 NHL season|1993]], Thorne served as the play-by-play voice of the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] (before being replaced by [[Mike Emrick]]) on [[FSN New York|SportsChannel New York]]. Thorne missed several Mets games in the [[1988 New York Mets season|1988 season]] due to [[1987\u201388 New Jersey Devils season|Devils]] playoff games. He was replaced after that Mets season by [[Gary Cohen]]. Thorne spent the following season with the [[1989 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thorne is most notable for announcing on the ''[[NHL on ESPN]]''. Thorne called the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] for [[ESPN]] from [[1992\u201393 NHL season|1993]]&ndash;[[2003\u201304 NHL season|2004]]\n\nIn March of 2014, Thorne called several high school games in the Class AA [[Minnesota State High School League]] boys hockey tournament for local independent TV station [[KSTC-TV]]. When interviewed by the [[The New York Times]], Thorne expressed his enjoyment for being asked to announce. \"It\u2019s a great event, and I thought it would be great fun. I think that\u2019s the word I used most often in the last three days, fun, because that\u2019s how I think of this. It\u2019s a wonderful event. It\u2019s great to see the kids play.

He called the end of two long-running Stanley Cup droughts, in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] for the [[New York Rangers]] and [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] for the [[Detroit Red Wings]].\n\nHe was named to call the play-by-play of [[USA Hockey|Team USA's]] games in the [[2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] for the [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] alongside Dave Starman. However, shortly before the tournament started, he was replaced by [[JP Dellacamera]] for personal reasons.

It was all for PR.\" Thorne later said that Mirabelli had only been joking. \"He said one thing, and I heard something else. I reported what I heard and what I honestly felt was said,\" Thorne said. \"Having talked with him today, there's no doubt in my mind that's not what he said, that's not what he meant. He explained that it was in the context of the sarcasm and the jabbing that goes on in the clubhouse. \"I took it as something serious, and it wasn't,\" Thorne said. Mirabelli confirmed the story, saying, \"He knows that I believe 100 percent that I thought the sock had blood on it. It never crossed my mind that there wasn't blood on that sock. If he misinterpreted something said inside the clubhouse, it's unfortunate.\" Mirabelli said he spoke with Thorne in the Boston clubhouse about six months after the 2004 playoffs. \"As he was walking away he asked, 'How about the bloody sock?' I said, 'Yeah, we got a lot of publicity out of that,' and that was all he can recall me saying,\" Mirabelli said. \"He said he assumed what I meant was that the sock was fake and that it was just a publicity stunt.

His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, [[individualism]], and sympathy for troubled individuals.<ref>Tannenbaum, Rob.

When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, \"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that.\"<ref>Cross, Charles R. \"Better Man\". ''Guitar World Presents: Guitar Legends: Pearl Jam''. July 2006.</ref> Vedder's guitar playing helped the band's sound progress toward a more stripped-down style; the songs \"Rearviewmirror\" and \"[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]\" (from ''Vitalogy'') feature Vedder's raw, punk-influenced guitar playing. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, \"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\"/> He has also contributed performances on the [[ukulele]], harmonica, [[accordion]], and [[electric sitar]] to various Pearl Jam recordings.\n\n[['Weird Al' Yankovic]] wrote the song \"My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder\" for his album [[Running with Scissors (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic album)|''Running with Scissors'']].

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"<ref name=\"hiatt\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nVedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam. He usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy. During Pearl Jam's 1992 appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', Vedder stood atop his stool, took out a marker pen, and wrote \"[[pro-choice]]\" down his arm in large letters when the band performed the song \"Porch\".

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"<ref name=\"hiatt\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nVedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam. He usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy. During Pearl Jam's 1992 appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', Vedder stood atop his stool, took out a marker pen, and wrote \"[[pro-choice]]\" down his arm in large letters when the band performed the song \"Porch\". During Pearl Jam's 2007 [[Lollapalooza]] headlining show, Vedder and the band played a song telling the crowd in Chicago to boycott the oil company [[BP|B.P.
