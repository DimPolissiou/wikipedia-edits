The satellite was originally considered to have been orbiting for the purpose of conducting various geophysical studies. However, nearly 4.5 years after its launch, it was specifically identified as a test platform for electrotechnical systems later used to ensure the orientation and stabilization of weather satellites. In addition, tests were made of power supplies using solar cell batteries. The satellite was in the form of a cylinder, with two hemispherical ends, and was {{convert|1.8|m}} long and {{convert|1.2|m}} in diameter. The control stabilisation system consisted of flywheels driven by electric motors. The kinetic energy of the flywheels was dampened by using electromagnets that produced torque by interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. This system provided three-axis stabilisation and oriented the satellite to Earth. Equipment on board monitored the operation of automatic devices that controlled the solar and chemical batteries. The satellite communicated via a \"Mayak\" radio transmitter operating at a frequency of 20 MHz. The results of these tests were incorporated in the [[Kosmos 122]] and subsequent launches in the [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]] system. A similar test flight will be made nearly 8 months later with Kosmos 23. These two flights comprised the first stage in the development of Soviet weather satellites.<ref name=\"Display\"/>\n\n==Mission==\nKosmos 14 was launched from [[Kapustin Yar|Mayak-2]] at [[Kapustin Yar]], aboard a [[Kosmos-2I]] 63S1 [[Launch vehicle|carrier rocket]].<ref name=\"JSR-LL\">{{cite web |url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> The launch occurred at 11:02:00 [[GMT]] on 13 April 1963, and resulted in the successful insertion of the satellite into a [[low Earth orbit]].<ref name=\"EA-K2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/kosmos2.htm|title=Kosmos 2|last=Wade|first=Mark |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=26 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690mZkz9v?url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/kosmos2.htm|archivedate=8 July 2012}}</ref> Upon reaching orbit, the satellite was assigned its [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]] designation, and received the [[International Designator]] 1963-010A.

It was an Omega satellite, derived from the [[Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik]] series. It was a {{convert|500|kg|lb}} spacecraft, which was built by the [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]], and was used by [[VNIIEM]] to conduct experiments with the use of [[gyroscope]]s to control spacecraft.<ref name=\"EA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/omega.htm|title=Omega|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nKosmos 14 was the first [[Soviet]] experimental [[weather]] satellite. The satellite was originally considered to have been orbiting for the purpose of conducting various geophysical studies. However, nearly 4.5 years after its launch, it was specifically identified as a test platform for electrotechnical systems later used to ensure the orientation and stabilization of weather satellites. In addition, tests were made of power supplies using solar cell batteries. The satellite was in the form of a cylinder, with two hemispherical ends, and was {{convert|1.8|m}} long and {{convert|1.2|m}} in diameter. The control stabilisation system consisted of flywheels driven by electric motors. The kinetic energy of the flywheels was dampened by using electromagnets that produced torque by interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. This system provided three-axis stabilisation and oriented the satellite to Earth. Equipment on board monitored the operation of automatic devices that controlled the solar and chemical batteries. The satellite communicated via a \"Mayak\" radio transmitter operating at a frequency of 20 MHz. The results of these tests were incorporated in the [[Kosmos 122]] and subsequent launches in the [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]] system. A similar test flight will be made nearly 8 months later with Kosmos 23.
