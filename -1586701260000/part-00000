Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.\n\n==Frequently used terms==\nOffshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same company in another country.\n\nIt is not the same as [[outsourcing]], which is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. This is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns.\n\nSubcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring: Offshore outsourcing.\n\nRelated terms include \n* [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting United States-based business processes to Canada, Mexico or [[Latin America]])\n* inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and \n* [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the \"best shore\" based on various criteria. \n* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] & [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced. More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.\n* [[Bodyshopping]] is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.\n\nOffshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring, and refers to substitution of a service from any company-owned foreign source for one formerly produced in the company's home country, whether or not outsourcing is involved.\n\n===Production offshoring===\nProduction offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas,<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Offshore manufacturing - definition and meaning\n   |url=https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/offshore-manufacturing}}</ref> usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.\n\n[[Physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]].\n\nThis trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.<ref>Fishman, T: \"China, Inc.\" Scribner, 2006.</ref>\n\n===IT-enabled services offshoring===\nGrowth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.<ref name=Telcom.out>{{cite book\n   |title=Managing Projects in Telecommunication Services\n   |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0470047674  |isbn=0470047674\n   |author=Mostafa Hashem Sherif |date=2006\n   |quote=(chapter) COMMUNICATION AND OUTSOURCING  ...

Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] mature.<ref>{{cite book |title=Offshoring |author=John Urry  |date=April 14, 2014  |isbn=978-0745664866 |publisher=polity UK}}</ref>\n\n====Reshoring terminology====\n'''Reshoring''' (also known as '''onshoring''', '''inshoring''' and '''backshoring''') is the act of reintroducing domestic manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work<ref name=\"documents.worldbank.org\">[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]</ref> considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the process, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond. A similar movement can be seen related to [[Robotic Process Automation]], called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on [[artificial intelligence]], where the incentive to move repetitive shared services work to lower cost countries is partially taken away by the progression of technology.\n\n==United States==\nFor the last twenty years, American companies have been \"offshoring\" and outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Government response===\nPresident Obama 2011 [[SelectUSA]] program was the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states.

This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn't so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.<ref name=\"bsc3\">{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|date=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]].

Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.\n\nOffshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.\n\n==Debate==\nOffshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.\n\nOn the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name=\"Paul Krugman\">{{cite newspaper  \n   |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2007\n   |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html\n   |author=Paul Krugman\n   |title=The Trouble with Trade}}</ref>\n\nCurrency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost.

Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of labor and [[capital mobility|capital]]; land has little or no mobility potential.\n\nIn [[microeconomics]], [[working capital]] funds the initial costs of offshoring.  If the state heavily [[regulation|regulates]] how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.\n\nComputers and the Internet made work in the services industry electronically portable. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if by accepting lower salaries or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.\n\nLabor scholars argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  |author=M.

Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.\n\n==Frequently used terms==\nOffshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same company in another country.\n\nIt is not the same as [[outsourcing]], which is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. This is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns.\n\nSubcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring: Offshore outsourcing.\n\nRelated terms include \n* [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting United States-based business processes to Canada, Mexico or [[Latin America]])\n* inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and \n* [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the \"best shore\" based on various criteria. \n* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] & [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced. More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.\n* [[Bodyshopping]] is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.\n\nOffshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring, and refers to substitution of a service from any company-owned foreign source for one formerly produced in the company's home country, whether or not outsourcing is involved.\n\n===Production offshoring===\nProduction offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas,<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Offshore manufacturing - definition and meaning\n   |url=https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/offshore-manufacturing}}</ref> usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.\n\n[[Physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]].\n\nThis trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.<ref>Fishman, T: \"China, Inc.\" Scribner, 2006.</ref>\n\n===IT-enabled services offshoring===\nGrowth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.<ref name=Telcom.out>{{cite book\n   |title=Managing Projects in Telecommunication Services\n   |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0470047674  |isbn=0470047674\n   |author=Mostafa Hashem Sherif |date=2006\n   |quote=(chapter) COMMUNICATION AND OUTSOURCING  ...

It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work<ref name=\"documents.worldbank.org\">[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]</ref> considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the process, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond. A similar movement can be seen related to [[Robotic Process Automation]], called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on [[artificial intelligence]], where the incentive to move repetitive shared services work to lower cost countries is partially taken away by the progression of technology.\n\n==United States==\nFor the last twenty years, American companies have been \"offshoring\" and outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Government response===\nPresident Obama 2011 [[SelectUSA]] program was the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states.

This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn't so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.<ref name=\"bsc3\">{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|date=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]].

Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.\n\nOffshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.\n\n==Debate==\nOffshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.\n\nOn the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name=\"Paul Krugman\">{{cite newspaper  \n   |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2007\n   |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html\n   |author=Paul Krugman\n   |title=The Trouble with Trade}}</ref>\n\nCurrency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost.

If the state heavily [[regulation|regulates]] how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.\n\nComputers and the Internet made work in the services industry electronically portable. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if by accepting lower salaries or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.\n\nLabor scholars argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  |author=M.

It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication crossed with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the [[Internet]], particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the [[World Wide Web]] reduced \"transportation\" costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Baase |title=A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet |edition=Third |location=Harlow |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-13-600848-4 }}</ref>\n\n===Impact of the Internet===\nRegardless of size, companies benefit from accessibility to labor resources across the world.<ref>Gartner Outlines the Top 10 Forces to Impact Outsourcing and IT Services Industry.

Because of Ireland's relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech \"boom\" and which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n===NAFTA===\nIn 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect, and it increased the velocity of [[physical restructuring]].\n\nThe plan to create free trade areas (such as [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]) has not yet been successful.

The Fire Brigade soon came, entering the building through the windows. They soon found the seat of the fire, underneath one of the main staircases; which had been enveloped in the fire.

Many hotels were expanding during this time such as the [[Great Western Hotel (Newquay)|Great Western Hotel]] and the Former St Brannocks Hotel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|title=Newquay Hotels|date=9 April 1931|work=The Newquay Express|access-date=|url-status=live|year=1931}}</ref> Thus, the art-deco themed, Fistral Bay Hotel and The Pentire Hotel became the first purpose built hotels in Pentire, both with their unique designs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Hotel is mentioned in an Autobiography Called \"Just Me\" by [[Joan Ball]].

The fire was discovered when someone from the neighboring Phelima hotel saw flames spewing out from the foyer. Seconds later, windows cracked and smoke poured out. The Fire Brigade soon came, entering the building through the windows. They soon found the seat of the fire, underneath one of the main staircases; which had been enveloped in the fire. The fire was soon extinguished, however, this incident only having lasted three hours.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Hotel Fire At Newquay|date=May 1957|work=The Newquay Express|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietress of the hotel Mrs M. E Lewes was not available when a Cornish guardian reporter called, but workmen were at the hotel the next day repairing the damage. It is understood that parties of New Zealand and Austrians visitors were expected that week.[[File:The Fistral Bay Hotel - Dance Floor.jpg|thumb|Fistral Bay Hotel Dance floor 2000]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

It is located in the east of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the [[Costa del Azahar]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The mountain range known as [[Desert de les Palmes]] rises inland north of the town.\n\nAccording to the 2018 census, Castell\u00f3n has a population of 170,888 inhabitants (called ''castellonencs'' in Valencian), ranking as the fourth most populated city in the Valencian Community (after [[Valencia]], [[Alicante]] and [[Elche]]). The [[Prime Meridian]] or Greenwich Meridian, crosses Castell\u00f3 de la Plana, and intersects with the 40th Parallel, and commemorates it with the Meridian Park (Parque del Meridiano) located at the exact point where this occurs.\n\n==History==\nThe first known [[building]] in the area was the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[castle]] of Fadrell, near the Alqueries de La Plana. The town proper was officially founded in 1251, after the [[Right of conquest|conquest]] of the Moorish Kingdom of Valencia by King [[James I of Aragon]] in 1233. James granted [[monarch|royal]] permission to move the town from the [[mountain]] to the [[plain]] on September 8, 1251, and [[tradition]] claims that the move was completed by the third Sunday of [[Lent]], 1252. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[city]] was protected by [[moat]]s, [[wall]]s and [[tower]]s, and a [[Church (building)|church]] was built, later becoming a [[cathedral]]. In the 16th century the town was one of the last [[fortification|strongholds]] in the [[Revolta de les Germanies]] (local [[guild]]s). It also supported [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314), but was later taken by the troops of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip d'Anjou]].\n\nIn the 19th century, the city walls were torn down and it slowly began to expand, a process interrupted by the [[Peninsular War|War of Independence]] against [[Napoleon]] (1804\u201314) and the [[Carlism|Carlist Wars]] (1833\u201363). In 1833 Castell\u00f3 became the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the newly constituted [[province]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the city again began to expand, marked by the arrival of the [[railway]], the enlargement of the [[port]] and the construction of representative buildings (Provincial [[Hospital]], [[Casino]], [[Theater]]) and [[park]]s.\n\nIn 1991 a university ([[Jaume I University]]) was established, set upon a modern [[campus]]. The local [[Economic system|economy]] is based on [[industry]], [[tourism]] and [[craft]]-work.\n\n== Main sights ==\nMost of the historical buildings are located in the diminutive old town, around the Pla\u00e7a Major (Main Square). These include:\n* The ''[[Concatedral de Santa Maria, Castell\u00f3|Concatedral de Santa Maria]]'' (co-cathedral of Saint Mary), built in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style in the 13th century and reconstructed one century later after destruction by fire. The present building is another reconstruction after the demolition ordered by the council during the Spanish civil war (1936).<ref>[http://www.memoriarepublicana.com/Persecrelig/monumvalencia.html].Obras religiosas destruidas durante la guerra civil (spanish)</ref>\n* The ''Ajuntament'' (City Hall), erected at the beginning of the 18th century. It features a [[Tuscany|Tuscan-style]] [[fa\u00e7ade]] rising up over a [[colonnade]].\n*[[File:Planetario de Castell\u00f3n de la Plana.JPG|thumb|Planetari de Castell\u00f3]]The free-standing bell-tower of the procathedral, known as ''[[El Fadr\u00ed]]'' (the single man), built in the 15th century.\n* The ''Llotja del C\u00e0nem'' ([[Hemp]] Exchange Market), built during the first half of the 17th century to be used by traders in hempen cloth and ropes, a very important activity in the area at the time. Today the building is used by the University for cultural events and temporary exhibitions.\n* On the northeast edge of the town, at the end of a broad avenue decorated with orange trees, stands the Bas\u00edlica of Santa Maria del ''Lled\u00f3'' (European [[Celtis|Hackberry]] or ''Celtis australis''), a basilica devoted to an image of the Virgin Mary found in 1366 by a farmer when he was ploughing his lands. The original 14th-century chapel was extended to its present Baroque form during the 16th century.\n* [[Espai d'Art Contemporani de Castell\u00f3]], Museum for Modern Art\n* [[Teatre Principal]]\n\n==Events==\nThe annual festivities in Castell\u00f3n are a week of celebrations three weeks before Easter every year called [[Magdalena Festival|La Magdalena]]. People come from all over the province and many international bands and groups participate.\n\nThe city is notorious for its music festivals, among which we find: early in February the Tanned Tin music [http://todoindie.com/arenal-sound-2016/ festival] for [[alternative music]] and [[experimental music]], in July the [[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]] (also known as FIB, which translates to Benic\u00e0ssim's International Festival), at the beginning of August there is the [[Arenal Sound]] and during the middle of that same month, we can find the [[Rototom Sunsplash Festival]], known for its [[reggae music]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe city has the professional [[basketball]] team [[AB Castell\u00f3]], which plays in [[LEB Oro]], Spanish second basketball division.\n\nThe local professional [[Association football|football]] club is [[CD Castell\u00f3n]]. However, despite having a 15,000 seater stadium ([[Nou Estadi Cast\u00e0lia]]), the club financial problems and unstable history brought it to play in semi-pro and amateur regional divisions, not playing in La Liga since the 1990\u201391 season. On 21 March 2018, Castell\u00f3n beat the record of seasonal tickets in the fourth-tier division with 12,701, and is considered a giant amongst minnows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdcastellon.com/el-cd-castellon-hace-historia-al-superar-el-record-de-abonados-en-tercera-division/|title=El CD Castell\u00f3n hace historia al superar el r\u00e9cord de abonados en Tercera Divisi\u00f3n|date=21 March 2018|accessdate=21 March 2018|language=es}}</ref> Currently they play on Spain's third league. The presence of [[Villarreal CF]] in the adjacent town (only 8&nbsp;km away) has created a fierce rivalry for geographical reasons. The success of Villarreal in the last decades, with a stable presence in La Liga since 2000 and including several European qualifications, is turning more and more supporters to its side.\n\nThe city is host to [[futsal]] club  [[CFS Bisontes Castell\u00f3n]], which under the name ''Playas de Castell\u00f3n'' was one of the best Spanish and European futsal clubs in the late 90s and early 2000s, having won the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Futsal|premier professional futsal league]] in Spain twice in 2000 and 2001, and the [[UEFA Futsal Cup]] three consecutive times in 2001, 2002 and 2003.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Ayuntamiento de Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, Castell\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ajuntament de Castell\u00f3 de la Plana]]\n[[Jaume I University]] was founded in 1991, and in 2014

It is located in the east of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the [[Costa del Azahar]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The mountain range known as [[Desert de les Palmes]] rises inland north of the town.\n\nAccording to the 2018 census, Castell\u00f3n has a population of 170,888 inhabitants (called ''castellonencs'' in Valencian), ranking as the fourth most populated city in the Valencian Community (after Valencia, Alicante and Elche). The [[Prime Meridian]] or Greenwich Meridian, crosses Castell\u00f3 de la Plana, and intersects with the 40th Parallel, and commemorates it with the Meridian Park (Parque del Meridiano) located at the exact point where this occurs.\n\n==History==\nThe first known [[building]] in the area was the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[castle]] of Fadrell, near the Alqueries de La Plana. The town proper was officially founded in 1251, after the [[Right of conquest|conquest]] of the Moorish Kingdom of Valencia by King [[James I of Aragon]] in 1233. James granted [[monarch|royal]] permission to move the town from the [[mountain]] to the [[plain]] on September 8, 1251, and [[tradition]] claims that the move was completed by the third Sunday of [[Lent]], 1252. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[city]] was protected by [[moat]]s, [[wall]]s and [[tower]]s, and a [[Church (building)|church]] was built, later becoming a [[cathedral]]. In the 16th century the town was one of the last [[fortification|strongholds]] in the [[Revolta de les Germanies]] (local [[guild]]s). It also supported [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314), but was later taken by the troops of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip d'Anjou]].\n\nIn the 19th century, the city walls were torn down and it slowly began to expand, a process interrupted by the [[Peninsular War|War of Independence]] against [[Napoleon]] (1804\u201314) and the [[Carlism|Carlist Wars]] (1833\u201363). In 1833 Castell\u00f3 became the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the newly constituted [[province]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the city again began to expand, marked by the arrival of the [[railway]], the enlargement of the [[port]] and the construction of representative buildings (Provincial [[Hospital]], [[Casino]], [[Theater]]) and [[park]]s.\n\nIn 1991 a university ([[Jaume I University]]) was established, set upon a modern [[campus]]. The local [[Economic system|economy]] is based on [[industry]], [[tourism]] and [[craft]]-work.\n\n== Main sights ==\nMost of the historical buildings are located in the diminutive old town, around the Pla\u00e7a Major (Main Square). These include:\n* The ''[[Concatedral de Santa Maria, Castell\u00f3|Concatedral de Santa Maria]]'' (co-cathedral of Saint Mary), built in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style in the 13th century and reconstructed one century later after destruction by fire. The present building is another reconstruction after the demolition ordered by the council during the Spanish civil war (1936).<ref>[http://www.memoriarepublicana.com/Persecrelig/monumvalencia.html].Obras religiosas destruidas durante la guerra civil (spanish)</ref>\n* The ''Ajuntament'' (City Hall), erected at the beginning of the 18th century. It features a [[Tuscany|Tuscan-style]] [[fa\u00e7ade]] rising up over a [[colonnade]].\n*[[File:Planetario de Castell\u00f3n de la Plana.JPG|thumb|Planetari de Castell\u00f3]]The free-standing bell-tower of the procathedral, known as ''[[El Fadr\u00ed]]'' (the single man), built in the 15th century.\n* The ''Llotja del C\u00e0nem'' ([[Hemp]] Exchange Market), built during the first half of the 17th century to be used by traders in hempen cloth and ropes, a very important activity in the area at the time. Today the building is used by the University for cultural events and temporary exhibitions.\n* On the northeast edge of the town, at the end of a broad avenue decorated with orange trees, stands the Bas\u00edlica of Santa Maria del ''Lled\u00f3'' (European [[Celtis|Hackberry]] or ''Celtis australis''), a basilica devoted to an image of the Virgin Mary found in 1366 by a farmer when he was ploughing his lands. The original 14th-century chapel was extended to its present Baroque form during the 16th century.\n* [[Espai d'Art Contemporani de Castell\u00f3]], Museum for Modern Art\n* [[Teatre Principal]]\n\n==Events==\nThe annual festivities in Castell\u00f3n are a week of celebrations three weeks before Easter every year called [[Magdalena Festival|La Magdalena]]. People come from all over the province and many international bands and groups participate.\n\nThe city is notorious for its music festivals, among which we find: early in February the Tanned Tin music [http://todoindie.com/arenal-sound-2016/ festival] for [[alternative music]] and [[experimental music]], in July the [[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]] (also known as FIB, which translates to Benic\u00e0ssim's International Festival), at the beginning of August there is the [[Arenal Sound]] and during the middle of that same month, we can find the [[Rototom Sunsplash Festival]], known for its [[reggae music]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe city has the professional [[basketball]] team [[AB Castell\u00f3]], which plays in [[LEB Oro]], Spanish second basketball division.\n\nThe local professional [[Association football|football]] club is [[CD Castell\u00f3n]]. However, despite having a 15,000 seater stadium ([[Nou Estadi Cast\u00e0lia]]), the club financial problems and unstable history make it play in semi-pro and amateur regional divisions, not playing in La Liga since the 1990\u201391 season. On 21 March 2018, Castell\u00f3n beat the record of seasonal tickets in the fourth-tier division with 12,701, and is considered a giant amongst minnows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdcastellon.com/el-cd-castellon-hace-historia-al-superar-el-record-de-abonados-en-tercera-division/|title=El CD Castell\u00f3n hace historia al superar el r\u00e9cord de abonados en Tercera Divisi\u00f3n|date=21 March 2018|accessdate=21 March 2018|language=es}}</ref> The presence of [[Villarreal CF]] in the adjacent town (only 8&nbsp;km away) has created a fierce rivalry for geographical reasons. The success of Villarreal in the last decades, with a stable presence in La Liga since 2000 and including several European qualifications, is turning more and more supporters to its side.\n\nThe city is host to [[futsal]] club  [[CFS Bisontes Castell\u00f3n]], which under the name ''Playas de Castell\u00f3n'' was one of the best Spanish and European futsal clubs in the late 90s and early 2000s, having won the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Futsal|premier professional futsal league]] in Spain twice in 2000 and 2001, and the [[UEFA Futsal Cup]] three consecutive times in 2001, 2002 and 2003.\n\n==Education==\n[[Jaume I University]] was founded in 1991, and in 2014 there were approximately 15,000 students enrolled who share a single campus.\n\n==Twin towns==\n*{{flagicon|France}}

He is known to make large donations from money he receives from his appearances in advertisements and other promotional work.\n\nJauch has used his personal wealth to purchase and restore several historic buildings in and around [[Potsdam]], his current town of residence.\n\nJauch has produced and hosted the [[prime time]] TV programme ''{{ill|stern TV|de}}'', a television [[news magazine]] programme, on the private German   [[RTL Television|RTL]] national TV network since 1990. The programme caused some sensation due to the transmission of falsified articles delivered by the journalist Michael Born who subsequently was convicted to a four-year prison sentence in 1996, a few other prominent German TV networks had also been deceived with such material.<ref>Thomas Pritzl: ''Der Fake-Faktor.

In line with his family\u2019s tradition of charitable foundations, Jauch endowed the founding of a branch of Die Arche in [[Drewitz]] (Potsdam) in 2009, which provides free meals for children in need.

He is known to make large donations from money he receives from his appearances in advertisements and other promotional work.\n\nJauch has used his personal wealth to purchase and restore several historic buildings in and around [[Potsdam]], his current town of residence.\n\nJauch has produced and hosted the [[prime time]] TV programme ''{{ill|stern TV|de}}'', a television [[news magazine]] programme, on the private German   [[RTL Television|RTL]] national TV network since 1990. The programme caused some sensation due to the transmission of falsified articles delivered by the journalist Michael Born who subsequently was convicted to a four-year prison sentence in 1996, a few other prominent German TV networks had also been deceived with such material.<ref>Thomas Pritzl: ''Der Fake-Faktor.

Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation [29], under the auspices of the Government of the NCT of Delhi, is the agency carrying out this task. The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars. [30]\n\nAs a part of the redevelopment, a multilevel parking cum commercial complex is coming up at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk. The project was inaugurated by Union minister of science and technology, Dr. Harshvardhan, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gandhi-maidan-parking-in-delhi-s-chandni-chowk-finally-takes-off/story-ZhEhEN6aQeTRx1a80GpmVP.html|title= Gandhi maidan parking in delhi s chandni chowk finally takes off }}</ref>\n\nThis multilevel parking cum commercial complex would be an eight-storeyed building with three basements covering 18,524 square meter area at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore on a PPP model with a Leading Real estate developer [[Omaxe]] .the project that has a capacity to accommodate over 2,300 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/breather-for-chandni-chowk-urban-art-body-clears-gandhi-maidan-parking/articleshow/69333159.cms]|title= Breather for Chandni chowk urban art body clears Gandhi maidan parking }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dariba Kalan]]\n* [[Gali paranthe walee]]\n* [[Jainism in Delhi]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n===Further reading===\n* ''Delhi, the emperor's city: rediscovering Chandni Chowk and its environs'', by Vijay Goel.

It is the location of the original [[Haldiram]]'s and brands such as Giani's.<ref name=giani> [http://www.gianisicecream.com]</ref> A particular local delicacy is the [[jalebi]]s, which are fried in pure [[ghee]] (clarified butter).\n\nStarting from the Red Fort end one finds the State Bank of India building.

Bhagirath Palace and the adjoining area have perhaps the biggest market in India for electrical goods, lamps and light fixtures. [[Dariba Kalan]] is the market for silver and gold jewelry. This market also offers trophies, shields, mementos and related items. At its Southern end (and close to the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi]]) is Bazaar Guliyan where about a hundred shops selling metallic and wooden statues, sculptures, bells, handicrafts are located, [[Nai Sarak]] is the wholesale market for stationery, books, paper and decorative materials. [[Chawri Bazar]] is a big market for greeting and wedding cards as well as plumbing and sanitaryware and accessories. Lal Kuan is a wholesale market for hardware and hotel kitchen equipment. Located at the western end of Chandni Chowk, [[Khari Baoli]] is a street entirely dedicated to all kinds of spices, dried fruits, nuts, herbs, grains, lentils, pickles and preserves/murabbas. Tilak Bazaar is a wholesale market for industrial chemicals. The Cloth Market supplies home furnishing fabrics, including ready-made items as well as design services.\n\n\n=== Restaurants and eateries ===\n[[File:Chandni Chowk, 2008 (18).JPG|thumb|Food shop on Khari Baoli Road]]\n\nChandni Chowk is home to several famous restaurants and [[halwai]]s (confectioners), most well known among them is [[Gali Paranthe Wali]].<ref>[http://www.mid-day.com/lifestyle/2008/sep/280908-Features-Sweets-roza-Chandni-Chowk.htm Chowk and cheese]</ref>\n\n* [[Gali Paranthe Wali|Paranthewali Gali]] with [[paratha]] shops from 1875\u20131886.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021110/spectrum/eat.htm ''Frozen paranthas posing a challenge to Paranthewali Gali fare''], [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]], 10 November 2002</ref>\n\n* Annapurna Bhandar established in 1929 by Late Mr.Purna Chander Modak<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timescity.com/delhi/chandni-chowk/mithai-restaurant-annapurna-bhandar/58449 |title=Annapurna Bhandar Mithai in Chandni Chowk, Delhi/NCR.Annapurna Bhandar Restaurant in Chandni Chowk,Delhi/NCR |publisher=Timescity |date= |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref> is popular for Bengali sweets.\n* Bikaner Sweet Shop, famous for [[rasmalai]].\n* Chaatwallah, established in 1923, famous for [[Chaat masala|fruit chaat]].\n* Chaina Ram Sindhi Halwai, established in 1948 serves famous besan ke laddoo, ghee patisa and ghevar like none in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abraxasnu.com/hangout/delhi-restaurants-street-food-in-chandni-chowk/|title=Delhi restaurants guide in India's premier youth magazine|website=www.abraxasnu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n* Giani's, famous for icecreams and Rabri [[Falooda]], established around 1947.\n* Gol Hatti, established in 1954, serves famous kullhad wale chhole chawal.\n* Hazari Lal Khurchan Wale, Kinaari Bazaar.

Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation [29], under the auspices of the Government of the NCT of Delhi, is the agency carrying out this task. The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars.

As such, the D. M. stands for ''Dis Manibus'', and the eight-letter inscription is a cipher concealing the name of the figure being memorialized. The solution provides a detailed decryption effort which asserts that a polyalphabetic cipher was used to encrypt the name \"Magdalen\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsden |first=Dave |title= Unveiling the Mystic Ciphers: Thomas Anson and the Shepherd's Monument Inscription |publisher= Dave Ramsden|date=December 2014|isbn= 1503119882 }}</ref>\n* The author and researcher George Edmunds in his book ''Anson's Gold'' proposes that everyone has overlooked the fact that Lord George Anson was a naval man. His creation of the cipher was to hide the latitude and longitude (alphanumerical code) of an island on which was buried a huge Spanish treasure. He mounted a secret expedition in the 18th century to recover this treasure,  which was located but due to unforeseen circumstances remains in place. Letters (in code) sent back to Lord Anson by the expedition leader validate and include part of the cipher, proof this is what the cipher was for.<ref>(''Anson's Gold'', published 2016)</ref>\n\nDespite the many theories, staff at Shugborough Hall remain sceptical of all proposed solutions.

As part of the Shugborough promotion, some individuals who had previously worked as codebreakers at [[Bletchley Park]] pursued this line of investigation. [[Oliver Lawn]] proposed that the letters may encode the phrase ''Jesus H Defy'', where the H supposedly stands for \"Christos\" (Greek for \"Messiah\") and the reference is to a [[Jesus bloodline]] which allegedly descends from a non-divine Jesus and was preserved by the Priory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1477527/Leters-remain-the-holy-grail-to-code-breakers.html|title=Letters remain the holy grail to code-breakers|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | first=Neil | last=Tweedie | date=2004-11-26}}</ref> Sheila Lawn, his wife, preferred the love-story theory.

He has speculated that the phrase may be the source of the earlier inscription \"OMNIA VANITAS\" which may have been carved on an alcove at the estate of one of Thomas Anson's associates, [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttleton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heardmusic.co.uk/page.asp?pid=93|title=Hidden Meanings?|author=Andrew Baker|accessdate=2011-03-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115093031/http://www.heardmusic.co.uk/page.asp?pid=93|archivedate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n* Former [[NSA]] [[linguist]] Keith Massey interprets the letters as an initialism for the Latin phrase  ''Oro Ut Omnes Sequantur Viam Ad Veram Vitam'' (\"I pray that all may follow the Way to True Life\") in reference to the Biblical verse [[John 14:6]], ''Ego sum Via et Veritas et Vita'' (\"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life\").<ref name=Massey>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/200-year-old-mystery-shugborough-code-solved-8319385|title=200-year-old mystery of Shugborough Code 'solved'|accessdate=2014-12-22|publisher=[[The Birmingham Post]]}}</ref>\n* Margaret, Countess of Lichfield (1899\u20131988) claimed that the inscription was a love message, referring to the lines ''Out Your Own Sweet Vale, Alicia, Vanishes Vanity. Twixt Deity and Man Thou, Shepherdess, The Way'', but no source for these words has ever been traced.<ref name =\"ShMon2\"/>\n* [[A. J. Morton]] observes that some of the letters match the names of the residents of Shugborough in the early 19th century, and believes that the inscription denotes the words ''Orgreave United with Overley and Shugborough, Viscount Anson Venables Vernon''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8295174/Shepherds-Monument-code-was-19th-century-graffiti.html#|title=Shepherd's Monument 'code' was 19th century graffiti|accessdate=2011-03-01|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=2011-02-01}}</ref>. This theory is no longer viable given the evidence uncovered by Dave Ramsden that the inscription was there in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsden |first=Dave |title= Unveiling the Mystic Ciphers: Thomas Anson and the Shepherd's Monument Inscription |publisher= Dave Ramsden|date=December 2014|isbn= 1503119882 }}</ref>\n* a 2014 book by Dave Ramsden which references manuscript evidence from the Staffordshire Record Office to demonstrate that Thomas Anson's peers understood the monument to be a funerary monument, dedicated to a syncretic female figure known as the \"Shepherdess\". As such, the D. M. stands for ''Dis Manibus'', and the eight-letter inscription is a cipher concealing the name of the figure being memorialized. The solution provides a detailed decryption effort which asserts that a polyalphabetic cipher was used to encrypt the name \"Magdalen\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsden |first=Dave |title= Unveiling the Mystic Ciphers: Thomas Anson and the Shepherd's Monument Inscription |publisher= Dave Ramsden|date=December 2014|isbn= 1503119882 }}</ref>\n* The author and researcher George Edmunds in his book ''Anson's Gold'' proposes that everyone has overlooked the fact that Lord George Anson was a naval man. His creation of the cipher was to hide the latitude and longitude (alphanumerical code) of an island on which was buried a huge Spanish treasure. He mounted a secret expedition in the 18th century to recover this treasure,  which was located but due to unforeseen circumstances remains in place. Letters (in code) sent back to Lord Anson by the expedition leader validate and include part of the cipher, proof this is what the cipher was for.<ref>(''Anson's Gold'', published 2016)</ref>\n\nDespite the many theories, staff at Shugborough Hall remain sceptical of all proposed solutions. A spokesman for the property (now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]) was quoted in 2014 asserting, \"We get five or six people a week who believe they have solved the code so we are a bit wary of them now.\"<ref name=Massey/>\n\n==Priory of Sion and the Holy Grail==\n\nIn 1982, the authors of the pseudohistorical ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' suggested that Poussin was a member of the [[Priory of Sion]], and that his ''Shepherds of Arcadia'' contained hidden meanings of great esoteric significance.\n\nIn 2003, [[Dan Brown]] copied these themes in his bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', and in 2004 Richard Kemp, the general manager of the Shugborough Estate, launched a promotional campaign which asserted a connection between Shugborough, and in particular the Shugborough inscription, and the Holy Grail.\n\nSpeculation then grew that the inscription may encode secrets related to the Priory of Sion,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4040127.stm|title=Code points away from Holy Grail|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2004-11-26}}</ref> or the location of the [[Holy Grail]]. As part of the Shugborough promotion, some individuals who had previously worked as codebreakers at [[Bletchley Park]] pursued this line of investigation. [[Oliver Lawn]] proposed that the letters may encode the phrase ''Jesus H Defy'', where the H supposedly stands for \"Christos\" (Greek for \"Messiah\") and the reference is to a [[Jesus bloodline]] which allegedly descends from a non-divine Jesus and was preserved by the Priory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1477527/Leters-remain-the-holy-grail-to-code-breakers.html|title=Letters remain the holy grail to code-breakers|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | first=Neil | last=Tweedie | date=2004-11-26}}</ref> Sheila Lawn, his wife, preferred the love-story theory.
