The sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n\nMore generally, the definition of sine (and other trigonometric functions) can be extended to any [[real number|real]] value in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]. More modern definitions express the sine as an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as the solution of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to [[complex number]]s.\n\nThe sine function is commonly used to model [[periodic function|periodic]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year.\n\nThe function sine can be traced to the [[Jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101|''jy\u0101'' and ''ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 '']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.<ref name=\"Boyer, Carl B. 1991 p. 210\">[[Uta Merzbach|Uta C.

The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n\n* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle of interest, in this case side&nbsp;''a''.\n* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side&nbsp;''h''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\n* The ''adjacent side'' is the remaining side, in this case side&nbsp;''b''.  It forms a side of (is adjacent to) both the angle of interest (angle ''A'') and the right angle.\n\nOnce such a triangle is chosen, the sine of the angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse, or:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\nThe other trigonometric functions of the angle can be defined similarly; for example, the [[Trigonometric functions#cosine|cosine]] of the angle is the ratio between the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, while the [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] gives the ratio between the opposite and adjacent sides.\n\nAs stated, the value <math>\\sin(\\alpha)</math> appears to depend on the choice of right triangle containing an angle of measure ''\u03b1''.  However, this is not the case: all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]], and so the ratio is the same for each of them.\n\n== Unit circle definition ==\n[[File:Unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Unit circle: the radius has length 1. The variable ''t'' measures the [[angle]] referred to as ''\u03b8'' in the text.]]\nIn [[trigonometry]], a unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nLet a line through the origin, making an angle of ''\u03b8'' with the positive half of the ''x''-axis, intersect the unit circle. The ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively. The point's distance from the origin is always&nbsp;1.\n\nUnlike the definitions with the right triangle or slope, the angle can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]]. This can also be achieved by requiring certain symmetries and that sine be a [[periodic function]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"450px\" heights=\"275px\">\nFile:Circle_cos_sin.gif|Animation showing how the sine function (in red) <math>y = \\sin(\\theta)</math> is graphed from the ''y''-coordinate (red dot) of a point on the [[unit circle]] (in green) at an angle of ''\u03b8''.\n</gallery>\n\n== Identities ==\n{{Main|List of trigonometric identities}}\n\nExact identities (using [[radian]]s):\n\nThese apply for all values of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n: <math>\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\csc(\\theta)}\n</math>\n\n=== Reciprocal ===\nThe [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of sine is cosecant, i.e., the reciprocal of {{math|sin(''A'')}} is {{math|csc(''A'')}}, or cosec(''A''). Cosecant gives the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side:\n\n:<math>\\csc(A) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac {\\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\\textrm{opposite}} = \\frac{h}{a}. </math>\n\n=== Inverse ===\n[[File:Arcsine.svg|thumb|180px|The usual principal values of the {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} function graphed on the cartesian plane. Arcsin is the inverse of sin.]]\nThe [[inverse function]] of sine is arcsine (arcsin or asin) or inverse sine ({{math|sin{{sup|-1}}}}). As sine is non-[[injective]], it is not an exact inverse function but a partial inverse function. For example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin({{pi}}) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2{{pi}}) {{=}} 0}} etc. It follows that the arcsine function is multivalued: {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} {{pi}}}}, {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 2{{pi}}}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]].\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\right) = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac {a}{h} \\right).</math>\n\n''k'' is some integer:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(y) = x \\iff & y = \\arcsin(x) + 2\\pi k , \\text{ or }\\\\\n & y = \\pi - \\arcsin(x) + 2\\pi k\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOr in one equation:\n\n:<math>\\sin(y) = x \\iff  y = (-1)^k \\arcsin(x) + \\pi k</math>\n\nArcsin satisfies:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\arcsin(x)) = x\\!</math>\nand\n:<math>\\arcsin(\\sin(\\theta)) = \\theta\\quad\\text{for }-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}.</math>\n\n=== Calculus ===\n{{See also|List of integrals of trigonometric functions|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}\n\nFor the sine function:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sin(x) </math>\n\nThe derivative is:\n\n:<math>f'(x) = \\cos(x) </math>\n\nThe antiderivative is:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\,dx = -\\cos(x) + C </math>\n\n''C'' denotes the [[constant of integration]].\n\n=== Other trigonometric functions ===\n[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|right|thumb|The sine and cosine functions are related in multiple ways.

In computing, it is typically abbreviated to <code>sin</code>.\n\nSome CPU architectures have a built-in instruction for sine, including the Intel x87 FPUs since the 80387.\n\nIn programming languages, <code>sin</code> is typically either a built-in function or found within the language's standard math library.\n\nFor example, the [[C standard library]] defines sine functions within [[C mathematical functions|math.h]]: <code>sin([[Double-precision floating-point format|double]])</code>, <code>sinf([[Single-precision floating-point format|float]])</code>, and <code>sinl([[long double]])</code>. The parameter of each is a [[floating point]] value, specifying the angle in radians. Each function returns the same [[data type]] as it accepts. Many other trigonometric functions are also defined in [[C mathematical functions|math.h]], such as for cosine, arc sine, and hyperbolic sine (sinh).\n\nSimilarly, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] defines <code>math.sin(x)</code> within the built-in <code>math</code> module. Complex sine functions are also available within the <code>cmath</code> module, e.g. <code>cmath.sin(z)</code>. [[CPython]]'s math functions call the [[C (programming language)|C]] <code>math</code> library, and use a [[double-precision floating-point format]].\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. [[IEEE 754-2008]], the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.<ref>Grand Challenges of Informatics, Paul Zimmermann. September 20, 2006 \u2013 p. 14/31 {{cite web |url=http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205108/http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref> Algorithms for calculating sine may be balanced for such constraints as speed, accuracy, portability, or range of input values accepted. This can lead to different results for different algorithms, especially for special circumstances such as very large inputs, e.g. <code>sin(10{{sup|22}})</code>.\n\nA once common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, was to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree. This allowed results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} <!-- Looking up in a table essentially involves copying a number from one memory location to another. How can calculating a sine be as quick as that? A: depends on many things, but mainly if the value in memory is not in cache, then the cache-miss can be relatively expensive, whereas a trig function never needs to touch main memory (or alternative, it can be expensive for the rest of the code to have the CPU cache filled with trig tables, causing cache-misses elsewhere). Probably needs a more definitive answer. Have changed 'typically' to 'may' for now. -->\n\nThe [[CORDIC]] algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.\n\n=== Turns based implementations ===\n\nSome software libraries provide implementations of sine using the input angle in half-[[Turn (angle)|turns]], a half-turn being an angle of 180 degrees or <math>\\pi</math> radians.

In contrast, representing <math>2\\pi</math>, <math>\\pi</math>, and <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> in binary floating-point or binary scaled fixed-point always involves a loss of accuracy. \n\nTurns also have an accuracy advantage and efficiency advantage for computing modulo to one period. Computing modulo 1 turn or modulo 2 half-turns can be losslessly and efficiently computed in both floating-point and fixed-point. For example, computing modulo 1 or modulo 2 for a binary point scaled fixed-point value requires only a bit shift or bitwise AND operation. In contrast, computing modulo <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> involves inaccuracies in representing <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>.\n\nFor applications involving angle sensors, the sensor typically provides angle measurements in a form directly compatible with turns or half-turns. For example, an angle sensor may count from 0 to 4096 over one complete revolution.<ref>\"[https://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Magnetic-Linear-And-Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/AAS33051.aspx ALLEGRO Angle Sensor Datasheet]</ref> If half-turns are used as the unit for angle, then the value provided by the sensor directly and losslessly maps to a fixed-point data type with 11 bits to the right of the binary point. In contrast, if radians are used as the unit for storing the angle, then the inaccuracies and cost of multiplying the raw sensor integer by an approximation to <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2048}</math> would be incurred.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[\u0100ryabha\u1e6da's sine table]]\n* [[Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula]]\n* [[Discrete sine transform]]\n* [[Euler's formula]]\n* [[Generalized trigonometry]]\n* [[Hyperbolic function]]\n* [[Law of sines]]\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Madhava's sine table]]\n* [[Optical sine theorem]]\n* [[Polar sine]]\u2014a generalization to vertex angles\n* [[Proofs of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Sinc function]]\n* [[Sine and cosine transforms]]\n* [[Sine integral]]\n* [[Sine quadrant]]\n* [[Sine wave]]\n* [[Sine\u2013Gordon equation]]\n* [[Sinusoidal model]]\n* [[Trigonometric functions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | first1 = John C. | last1 = Traupman, Ph.D. | year = 1966 | title = The New College Latin & English Dictionary | publisher = Bantam | location = Toronto | isbn = 0-553-27619-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/boysgirlsbookabo00gard_0 }}\n* {{citation | title = Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary | location = Springfield | publisher =G. & C.

The sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n\nMore generally, the definition of sine (and other trigonometric functions) can be extended to any [[real number|real]] value in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]. More modern definitions express the sine as an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as the solution of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to [[complex number]]s.\n\nThe sine function is commonly used to model [[periodic function|periodic]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year.\n\nThe function sine can be traced to the [[Jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101|''jy\u0101'' and ''ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 '']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.<ref name=\"Boyer, Carl B. 1991 p. 210\">[[Uta Merzbach|Uta C.

The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n\n* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle of interest, in this case side&nbsp;''a''.\n* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side&nbsp;''h''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\n* The ''adjacent side'' is the remaining side, in this case side&nbsp;''b''.  It forms a side of (is adjacent to) both the angle of interest (angle ''A'') and the right angle.\n\nOnce such a triangle is chosen, the sine of the angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse, or:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\nThe other trigonometric functions of the angle can be defined similarly; for example, the [[Trigonometric functions#cosine|cosine]] of the angle is the ratio between the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, while the [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] gives the ratio between the opposite and adjacent sides.\n\nAs stated, the value <math>\\sin(\\alpha)</math> appears to depend on the choice of right triangle containing an angle of measure ''\u03b1''.  However, this is not the case: all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]], and so the ratio is the same for each of them.\n\n== Unit circle definition ==\n[[File:Unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Unit circle: the radius has length 1. The variable ''t'' measures the [[angle]] referred to as ''\u03b8'' in the text.]]\nIn [[trigonometry]], a unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nLet a line through the origin, making an angle of ''\u03b8'' with the positive half of the ''x''-axis, intersect the unit circle. The ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively. The point's distance from the origin is always&nbsp;1.\n\nUnlike the definitions with the right triangle or slope, the angle can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]]. This can also be achieved by requiring certain symmetries and that sine be a [[periodic function]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"450px\" heights=\"275px\">\nFile:Circle_cos_sin.gif|Animation showing how the sine function (in red) <math>y = \\sin(\\theta)</math> is graphed from the ''y''-coordinate (red dot) of a point on the [[unit circle]] (in green) at an angle of ''\u03b8''.\n</gallery>\n\n== Identities ==\n{{Main|List of trigonometric identities}}\n\nExact identities (using [[radian]]s):\n\nThese apply for all values of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n: <math>\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\csc(\\theta)}\n</math>\n\n=== Reciprocal ===\nThe [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of sine is cosecant, i.e., the reciprocal of {{math|sin(''A'')}} is {{math|csc(''A'')}}, or cosec(''A''). Cosecant gives the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side:\n\n:<math>\\csc(A) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac {\\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\\textrm{opposite}} = \\frac{h}{a}. </math>\n\n=== Inverse ===\n[[File:Arcsine.svg|thumb|180px|The usual principal values of the {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} function graphed on the cartesian plane. Arcsin is the inverse of sin.]]\nThe [[inverse function]] of sine is arcsine (arcsin or asin) or inverse sine ({{math|sin{{sup|-1}}}}). As sine is non-[[injective]], it is not an exact inverse function but a partial inverse function. For example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin({{pi}}) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2{{pi}}) {{=}} 0}} etc. It follows that the arcsine function is multivalued: {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} {{pi}}}}, {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 2{{pi}}}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]].\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\right) = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac {a}{h} \\right).</math>\n\n''k'' is some integer:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(y) = x \\iff & y = \\arcsin(x) + 2\\pi k , \\text{ or }\\\\\n & y = \\pi - \\arcsin(x) + 2\\pi k\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOr in one equation:\n\n:<math>\\sin(y) = x \\iff  y = (-1)^k \\arcsin(x) + \\pi k</math>\n\nArcsin satisfies:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\arcsin(x)) = x\\!</math>\nand\n:<math>\\arcsin(\\sin(\\theta)) = \\theta\\quad\\text{for }-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}.</math>\n\n=== Calculus ===\n{{See also|List of integrals of trigonometric functions|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}\n\nFor the sine function:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sin(x) </math>\n\nThe derivative is:\n\n:<math>f'(x) = \\cos(x) </math>\n\nThe antiderivative is:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\,dx = -\\cos(x) + C </math>\n\n''C'' denotes the [[constant of integration]].\n\n=== Other trigonometric functions ===\n[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|right|thumb|The sine and cosine functions are related in multiple ways.

Since Arabic is written without short vowels, \"jb\" was interpreted as the word ''jaib'' \u062c\u064a\u0628, which means \"bosom\". When the Arabic texts were translated in the 12th century into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] by [[Gerard of Cremona]], he used the Latin equivalent for \"bosom\", ''[[wikt:sinus|sinus]]'' (which means \"bosom\" or \"bay\" or \"fold\").<ref>Eli Maor (1998), ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 35-36.</ref><ref>Victor J.

In computing, it is typically abbreviated to <code>sin</code>.\n\nSome CPU architectures have a built-in instruction for sine, including the Intel x87 FPUs since the 80387.\n\nIn programming languages, <code>sin</code> is typically either a built-in function or found within the language's standard math library.\n\nFor example, the [[C standard library]] defines sine functions within [[C mathematical functions|math.h]]: <code>sin([[Double-precision floating-point format|double]])</code>, <code>sinf([[Single-precision floating-point format|float]])</code>, and <code>sinl([[long double]])</code>. The parameter of each is a [[floating point]] value, specifying the angle in radians. Each function returns the same [[data type]] as it accepts. Many other trigonometric functions are also defined in [[C mathematical functions|math.h]], such as for cosine, arc sine, and hyperbolic sine (sinh).\n\nSimilarly, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] defines <code>math.sin(x)</code> within the built-in <code>math</code> module. Complex sine functions are also available within the <code>cmath</code> module, e.g. <code>cmath.sin(z)</code>. [[CPython]]'s math functions call the [[C (programming language)|C]] <code>math</code> library, and use a [[double-precision floating-point format]].\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. [[IEEE 754-2008]], the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.<ref>Grand Challenges of Informatics, Paul Zimmermann. September 20, 2006 \u2013 p. 14/31 {{cite web |url=http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205108/http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref> Algorithms for calculating sine may be balanced for such constraints as speed, accuracy, portability, or range of input values accepted. This can lead to different results for different algorithms, especially for special circumstances such as very large inputs, e.g. <code>sin(10{{sup|22}})</code>.\n\nA once common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, was to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree. This allowed results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} <!-- Looking up in a table essentially involves copying a number from one memory location to another. How can calculating a sine be as quick as that? A: depends on many things, but mainly if the value in memory is not in cache, then the cache-miss can be relatively expensive, whereas a trig function never needs to touch main memory (or alternative, it can be expensive for the rest of the code to have the CPU cache filled with trig tables, causing cache-misses elsewhere). Probably needs a more definitive answer. Have changed 'typically' to 'may' for now. -->\n\nThe [[CORDIC]] algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.\n\n=== Turns based implementations ===\n\nSome software libraries provide implementations of sine using the input angle in half-[[Turn (angle)|turns]], a half-turn being an angle of 180 degrees or <math>\\pi</math> radians. Representing angles in turns or half-turns has accuracy advantages and efficiency advantages in some cases.\n<ref>\"[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.sinpi.html MATLAB Documentation sinpi]</ref>\n<ref>\"[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.3/topics/Trig R Documentation sinpi]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In contrast, representing <math>2\\pi</math>, <math>\\pi</math>, and <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> in binary floating-point or binary scaled fixed-point always involves a loss of accuracy. \n\nTurns also have an accuracy advantage and efficiency advantage for computing modulo to one period. Computing modulo 1 turn or modulo 2 half-turns can be losslessly and efficiently computed in both floating-point and fixed-point. For example, computing modulo 1 or modulo 2 for a binary point scaled fixed-point value requires only a bit shift or bitwise AND operation. In contrast, computing modulo <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> involves inaccuracies in representing <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>.\n\nFor applications involving angle sensors, the sensor typically provides angle measurements in a form directly compatible with turns or half-turns. For example, an angle sensor may count from 0 to 4096 over one complete revolution.<ref>\"[https://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Magnetic-Linear-And-Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/AAS33051.aspx ALLEGRO Angle Sensor Datasheet]</ref> If half-turns are used as the unit for angle, then the value provided by the sensor directly and losslessly maps to a fixed-point data type with 11 bits to the right of the binary point. In contrast, if radians are used as the unit for storing the angle, then the inaccuracies and cost of multiplying the raw sensor integer by an approximation to <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2048}</math> would be incurred.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[\u0100ryabha\u1e6da's sine table]]\n* [[Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula]]\n* [[Discrete sine transform]]\n* [[Euler's formula]]\n* [[Generalized trigonometry]]\n* [[Hyperbolic function]]\n* [[Law of sines]]\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Madhava's sine table]]\n* [[Optical sine theorem]]\n* [[Polar sine]]\u2014a generalization to vertex angles\n* [[Proofs of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Sinc function]]\n* [[Sine and cosine transforms]]\n* [[Sine integral]]\n* [[Sine quadrant]]\n* [[Sine wave]]\n* [[Sine\u2013Gordon equation]]\n* [[Sinusoidal model]]\n* [[Trigonometric functions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | first1 = John C. | last1 = Traupman, Ph.D. | year = 1966 | title = The New College Latin & English Dictionary | publisher = Bantam | location = Toronto | isbn = 0-553-27619-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/boysgirlsbookabo00gard_0 }}\n* {{citation | title = Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary | location = Springfield | publisher =G. & C.

Road testing commenced in 1991 and continued from 1992 to 1993. The first generation Renault Laguna was unveiled in November 1993, and launched in January 1994, as a replacement for the [[Renault 21]], initially coming as a hatchback only.\n\nAt the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]] in September 1995, an [[station wagon|estate]] version was introduced. This was known in some markets as the '''Laguna Sports Tourer''', and replaced the 21 based [[Renault 21|Renault Savanna/Nevada]]. It was initially launched as a 1.8 RN/RT, 2.0RT/RXE, and 3.0V6. A sports pack with deep front spoiler, rear spoiler, and alloy wheels was available on 2.0 versions.\n\nA limited-edition of 500 1.8RT Sport was made available in 1996, one hundred each of five colours including a metallic blue normally reserved for 2.0 models. \n\nThese limited editions sold out very quickly and so (to the annoyance of those who bought one of the original 500), the RT Sport was incorporated into the standard range at a cheaper price but having ABS, air conditioning, CD/Radio, and high-level brake light added as standard (all these were options on the more expensive, original 500). This coincided with Renault's participation in European [[Touring car]] championships.\n\nThe Laguna's equipment levels were generally much higher than the Renault 21. From launch, all models came with power steering, electric front windows, and remote central locking as standard. Most of the range had a driver's [[airbag]]. Later twin airbags, [[anti-lock braking system]], [[air-conditioning]], and a [[CD player]] became either optional extras or standard equipment.\n\nIt was given a minor update in September 1996, which included a new ''Laguna'' nameplate at the rear.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:1997 Renault Laguna RT 2.0 Rear.jpg|1994\u20131998 Renault Laguna (hatchback)\nFile:Renault Laguna (22037467020).jpg|1994\u20131998 Renault Laguna (estate)\nFile:Laguna1p1w.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n===Laguna Biturbo===\n\nAlso, following the pace of the [[Renault Safrane|Safrane Biturbo]], there was also a high-performance version of Laguna, named as '''Laguna Biturbo'''.

This also included a different facelifted design of the taillights, most noticeable are the circular fog lights in the front.\n\nThe engines were updated and, in some markets, equipment levels were enhanced again. Five new engines featured in the completed facelifted lineup:\n* K4M 1.6 16v (109&nbsp;hp)\n* F4P 1.8 16v (120&nbsp;hp)\n* F3R 2.0 (114&nbsp;hp)\n* N7Q 2.0 S (140&nbsp;hp)\n* F4R 2.0 16v (139&nbsp;hp)\n* L7X 3.0 V6 24v (190&nbsp;hp)\n* F9Q turbo 1.9 dTi (turbo charged direct injection) (98&nbsp;hp)\n* F9Q turbo 1.9 dCi (turbo charged [[common rail]] direct injection) (107&nbsp;hp)\n* G8T turbo 2.2 dT (turbo charged indirect injection) (113&nbsp;hp)\n\nFor 2000, the final edition of this Laguna, the ''Laguna Concorde'', was introduced. It included semi leather seats and vocal warnings like \"Welcome. The vehicle computer... is now checking systems for you\". The on board computer would notify the driver of any doors not being closed, lights left on, etc., weather (\"Please brake carefully the road is watery\") or other faults in the electrical or mechanical circuits.\n\nThe onboard voice synthesizer warnings system was also available on the earlier 1998 RXE and V6 models. This is the same basic unit as used in the Renault Safrane.\n\nThe Mark 1 model has many bad reviews and reliability issues with everything from rear wheel bearing problems (a common Renault problem over several models) and heavy depreciation to problems with the bonnet latches (Renault use an unusual system that is difficult to set up properly).\n\nThe reviews tended to be worse for the hatchback, with it suffering many more complaints and breakdowns than the estate variant, although no reasoning for this has been found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/owners-reviews/search.aspx?model=714 |title=Renault Laguna owners' reviews, problems and advice |publisher=Parkers |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327154604/http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/owners-reviews/search.aspx?model=714 |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Laguna Concorde model was the last guise of the \"old\" Laguna's to be marketed, prior to the release of the Laguna II in 2000. The last of the Mk.1 Laguna's were registered in February 2001, and the Concorde range all feature a cream letter \"C\" on a dark green background.

The engines were upgraded, and the equipment list made longer.\n\nIt was the first vehicle available in [[Europe]] to achieve five stars in the [[EuroNCAP]] crash test results, a feature that was soon followed by all other models in Renault's range. This generation was made available in hatchback or estate (Grandtour) styles only.\n\nThe Laguna was the first European family car, and the second European car to feature \"keyless\" entry and ignition.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Renault Cars Have Won Many Awards|url=http://www.anythingaboutcars.com/renault-cars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About Us \u00bb Renault New Zealand|url=http://www.renault.co.nz/about-us/|website=Renault.co.nz}}</ref> Instead of a [[Car key|key]], it used a credit card style device to unlock the car and start the engine. The styling of the second generation Laguna was heavily influenced by the [[Renault Initiale|Initiale]] concept car.\n\nThe Laguna II won the title [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]] in November 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eforecourt.com/body.htm/pid/217/catagory/general|title=Renault Laguna takes Semperit Irish Car of the Year crown|publisher=eforecourt|date=26 November 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Laguna estate was only available with five seats, unlike the previous model which had seven seats as an option on some versions. It was badged as Sports Tourer or Grandtour, depending on the country. It was also marketed as a lifestyle vehicle, rather than a load carrier.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:RenaultLaguna2.jpg|thumb|Facelifted Renault Laguna II (2005\u20132007)]]\n[[File:Renault Laguna rear.JPG|thumb|right|Facelifted Renault Laguna (2005\u20132007)]]\nThe Laguna II was facelifted in March 2005, according to Renault with improved security, driving performance and comfort. It also had a moderate redesign of the air intake at the front of the car, now matching the design of the Megane.\n\nAn electronic handbrake was also introduced, this was previously seen on the Scenic and Espace. The engines were much the same as before, with the 1.6 and 1.8 petrol units being offered in some markets, while other countries get a 2.0 petrol unit (turbo or non turbo) and two diesels (1.9 or 2.2 direct injection).\n\nAfter the facelift, a whole new diesel engine was introduced, the 2.0 dCi with {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and another variant of the engine which produced {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, In May 2007, this variant was the most powerful 2 litre diesel engine in the world.\n\n[[File:Renault Laguna interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]\n\n===Engines===\n{|

The car was unveiled to the public at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2007|Frankfurt Motor Show]] in September, and it went on sale in October 2007. The car comes as a five-door [[hatchback]], as a five-door [[station wagon|estate]] and a three-door [[coup\u00e9]].\n\nThis third-generation is based on the [[Nissan D platform|platform D]], shared with the [[Nissan Altima]], the [[Nissan Teana]], and the [[Nissan Murano]]. The Laguna III was the first car to have gone through the Aubevoye Technical Centre's ''Electro-Magnetic Compatibility'' unit, in the course of its development.\n\nIt was first presented as a concept car, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2007|2007 Frankfurt Motor Show]], which followed some styling cues of the previous concept car, the [[Renault Fluence]]. The production version was revealed at the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]], coinciding with the [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix]] to take the wraps off.\n\nThe brand new [[V6]] dCi engine delivers 235&nbsp;hp (173&nbsp;kW), while the new 3.5 litre petrol powered V6 offers 240&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW). The Laguna Coup\u00e9 later appeared before the general public at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show|Paris Motor Show]] in October 2008. In January 2008, spy images of a then possible Laguna Sedan appeared on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9080115.009/renault-laguna-sedan-spied |title=Renault Laguna Sedan Spied |publisher=Worldcarfans |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIt was expected the car having appeared at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10802052427/more-renault-laguna-sedan-spy-pics|title=More Renault Laguna Sedan Spy Pics|publisher=Worldcarfans |date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref> However, this never made it to production.

Road testing commenced in 1991 and continued from 1992 to 1993. The first generation Renault Laguna was unveiled in November 1993, and launched in January 1994, as a replacement for the [[Renault 21]], initially coming as a hatchback only.\n\nAt the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1995|Frankfurt Motor Show]] in September 1995, an [[station wagon|estate]] version was introduced. This was known in some markets as the '''Laguna Sports Tourer''', and replaced the 21 based [[Renault 21|Renault Savanna/Nevada]]. It was initially launched as a 1.8 RN/RT, 2.0RT/RXE, and 3.0V6. A sports pack with deep front spoiler, rear spoiler, and alloy wheels was available on 2.0 versions.\n\nA limited-edition of 500 1.8RT Sport was made available in 1996, one hundred each of five colours including a metallic blue normally reserved for 2.0 models. \n\nThese limited editions sold out very quickly and so (to the annoyance of those who bought one of the original 500), the RT Sport was incorporated into the standard range at a cheaper price but having ABS, air conditioning, CD/Radio, and high-level brake light added as standard (all these were options on the more expensive, original 500). This coincided with Renault's participation in European [[Touring car]] championships.\n\nThe Laguna's equipment levels were generally much higher than the Renault 21. From launch, all models came with power steering, electric front windows, and remote central locking as standard. Most of the range had a driver's [[airbag]]. Later twin airbags, [[anti-lock braking system]], [[air-conditioning]], and a [[CD player]] became either optional extras or standard equipment.\n\nIt was given a minor update in September 1996, which included a new ''Laguna'' nameplate at the rear.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:1997 Renault Laguna RT 2.0 Rear.jpg|1994\u20131998 Renault Laguna (hatchback)\nFile:Renault Laguna (22037467020).jpg|1994\u20131998 Renault Laguna (estate)\nFile:Laguna1p1w.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n===Laguna Biturbo===\n\nAlso, following the pace of the [[Renault Safrane|Safrane Biturbo]], there was also a high-performance version of Laguna, named as '''Laguna Biturbo'''.

This also included a different facelifted design of the taillights, most noticeable are the circular fog lights in the front.\n\nThe engines were updated and, in some markets, equipment levels were enhanced again. Five new engines featured in the completed facelifted lineup:\n* K4M 1.6 16v (109&nbsp;hp)\n* F4P 1.8 16v (120&nbsp;hp)\n* F3R 2.0 (114&nbsp;hp)\n* N7Q 2.0 S (140&nbsp;hp)\n* F4R 2.0 16v (139&nbsp;hp)\n* L7X 3.0 V6 24v (190&nbsp;hp)\n* F9Q turbo 1.9 dTi (turbo charged direct injection) (98&nbsp;hp)\n* F9Q turbo 1.9 dCi (turbo charged [[common rail]] direct injection) (107&nbsp;hp)\n* G8T turbo 2.2 dT (turbo charged indirect injection) (113&nbsp;hp)\n\nFor 2000, the final edition of this Laguna, the ''Laguna Concorde'', was introduced. It included semi leather seats and vocal warnings like \"Welcome. The vehicle computer... is now checking systems for you\". The on board computer would notify the driver of any doors not being closed, lights left on, etc., weather (\"Please brake carefully the road is watery\") or other faults in the electrical or mechanical circuits.\n\nThe onboard voice synthesizer warnings system was also available on the earlier 1998 RXE and V6 models. This is the same basic unit as used in the Renault Safrane.\n\nThe Mark 1 model has many bad reviews and reliability issues with everything from rear wheel bearing problems (a common Renault problem over several models) and heavy depreciation to problems with the bonnet latches (Renault use an unusual system that is difficult to set up properly).\n\nThe reviews tended to be worse for the hatchback, with it suffering many more complaints and breakdowns than the estate variant, although no reasoning for this has been found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/owners-reviews/search.aspx?model=714 |title=Renault Laguna owners' reviews, problems and advice |publisher=Parkers |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327154604/http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/owners-reviews/search.aspx?model=714 |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Laguna Concorde model was the last guise of the \"old\" Laguna's to be marketed, prior to the release of the Laguna II in 2000. The last of the Mk.1 Laguna's were registered in February 2001, and the Concorde range all feature a cream letter \"C\" on a dark green background.

The engines were upgraded, and the equipment list made longer.\n\nIt was the first vehicle available in [[Europe]] to achieve five stars in the [[EuroNCAP]] crash test results, a feature that was soon followed by all other models in Renault's range. This generation was made available in hatchback or estate (Grandtour) styles only.\n\nThe Laguna was the first European family car, and the second European car to feature \"keyless\" entry and ignition.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Renault Cars Have Won Many Awards|url=http://www.anythingaboutcars.com/renault-cars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About Us \u00bb Renault New Zealand|url=http://www.renault.co.nz/about-us/|website=Renault.co.nz}}</ref> Instead of a [[Car key|key]], it used a credit card style device to unlock the car and start the engine. The styling of the second generation Laguna was heavily influenced by the [[Renault Initiale|Initiale]] concept car.\n\nThe Laguna II won the title [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]] in November 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eforecourt.com/body.htm/pid/217/catagory/general|title=Renault Laguna takes Semperit Irish Car of the Year crown|publisher=eforecourt|date=26 November 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Laguna estate was only available with five seats, unlike the previous model which had seven seats as an option on some versions. It was badged as Sports Tourer or Grandtour, depending on the country. It was also marketed as a lifestyle vehicle, rather than a load carrier.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:RenaultLaguna2.jpg|thumb|Facelifted Renault Laguna II (2005\u20132007)]]\n[[File:Renault Laguna rear.JPG|thumb|right|Facelifted Renault Laguna (2005\u20132007)]]\nThe Laguna II was facelifted in March 2005, according to Renault with improved security, driving performance and comfort. It also had a moderate redesign of the air intake at the front of the car, now matching the design of the Megane.\n\nAn electronic handbrake was also introduced, this was previously seen on the Scenic and Espace. The engines were much the same as before, with the 1.6 and 1.8 petrol units being offered in some markets, while other countries get a 2.0 petrol unit (turbo or non turbo) and two diesels (1.9 or 2.2 direct injection).\n\nAfter the facelift, a whole new diesel engine was introduced, the 2.0 dCi with {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and another variant of the engine which produced {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, In May 2007, this variant was the most powerful 2 litre diesel engine in the world.\n\n[[File:Renault Laguna interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]\n\n===Engines===\n{|

The production version was revealed at the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]], coinciding with the [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix]] to take the wraps off.\n\nThe brand new [[V6]] dCi engine delivers 235&nbsp;hp (173&nbsp;kW), while the new 3.5 litre petrol powered V6 offers 240&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW). The Laguna Coup\u00e9 later appeared before the general public at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show|Paris Motor Show]] in October 2008.

When Garad Abogne was in power he was defeated and killed by Sultan [[Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad]], and In 1554, under his initiative, [[Harar]] became the capital of Adal.<ref name=\"Lewispd\"/> This time not only the young Emirs revolted, but the whole country of Adal rose against Sultan Abu Bakr, because Garad Abogne was loved by the people of the sultanate. Many people went to join the force of a young imam called [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], who claimed revenge for Garad Abogne. Al-Ghazi assumed power in Adal in 1527, however he did not remove the Sultan, but instead left him in his nominal office. Yet, when Abu Bakr waged war on him, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim killed Abu Bakr, and replaced him with his brother [[Umar Din]].<ref name =\"The Cambridge History of Africa: From c. 1050 to c. 1600\">{{cite journal | last =Fage | first =J.

According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Towns such as [[Awbare]], [[Awbube]], [[Amud]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] and Gogesa, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 [[silver coin]]s, unlike the [[copper]] pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan [[Barquq]] (1382\u201399), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either [[Cairo]] or [[Damascus]]. A few [[gold coin]]s were also discovered during the expedition, making the area the only place in the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality [[porcelain]] was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine [[celadon]] ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense [[midden]]s four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular [[sherd]]s with a cracked blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncracked green-white glaze. Some [[Ming dynasty]] ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an [[Indian Ocean]] terminus at the [[Sa'ad ad-Din Islands]], named for Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] of the Ifat Sultanate.<ref name=\"Konczacki\">{{cite book|last1=Zbigniew A.

Supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with firearms, Ahmad was able to defeat the Abyssinians at the [[Battle of Shimbra Kure]] in 1529 and seize control of the wealthy [[Ethiopian highlands]], though the Abyssinians continued to resist from the highlands. In 1541, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who had vested interests in the [[Indian Ocean]], eventually sent aid to the Abyssinians in the form of 400 [[musketeers]]. Adal, in response, received 900 from the Ottomans.\n\nImam Ahmad was initially successful against the Abyssinians while campaigning in the Autumn of 1542, killing the Portuguese commander [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]] in August that year. However, Portuguese musketry proved decisive in Adal's defeat at the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], near Lake Tana, in February 1543, where Ahmad was killed in battle.

According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Towns such as [[Awbare]], [[Awbube]], [[Amud]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] and Gogesa, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 [[silver coin]]s, unlike the [[copper]] pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan [[Barquq]] (1382\u201399), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either [[Cairo]] or [[Damascus]]. A few [[gold coin]]s were also discovered during the expedition, making the area the only place in the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality [[porcelain]] was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine [[celadon]] ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense [[midden]]s four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular [[sherd]]s with a cracked blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncracked green-white glaze. Some [[Ming dynasty]] ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an [[Indian Ocean]] terminus at the [[Sa'ad ad-Din Islands]], named for Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] of the Ifat Sultanate.<ref name=\"Konczacki\">{{cite book|last1=Zbigniew A.

According to Joussaume (1995), who led archaeological work there, the site is relatively recent. It has been dated to between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. Tiya contains a number of [[megalith]]ic pillars, including anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic/non-phallic [[stele|stelae]].

The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

Character-specific items and increased item probabilities have been re-added. The Mega Mushroom also makes its return after an eleven-year absence. The game also added Frenzy Mode, which happens when the character receives three of the same item during the race.\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\n''Mario Kart'' mainly features [[List of Mario franchise characters|characters from the ''Mario'' franchise]].

Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle.

Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards.

They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]].

The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

Character-specific items and increased item probabilities have been re-added. The Mega Mushroom also makes its return after an eleven-year absence. The game also added Frenzy Mode, which happens when the character receives three of the same item during the race.\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\n''Mario Kart'' mainly features [[List of Mario franchise characters|characters from the ''Mario'' franchise]]. The ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' series features [[Bandai Namco]] characters such as [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mario Kart Arcade GP |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/triforce/mario_kart_arcade_gp |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=April 5, 2019|date=December 2011 }}</ref> The [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' added [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] from ''[[Animal Crossing]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulef |first1=Jeffrey |title=Mario Kart 8 getting Zelda and Animal Crossing DLC |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-26-mario-kart-8-is-getting-zelda-and-animal-crossing-dlc |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |date=August 27, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' features 42 characters, including the Inklings from ''[[Splatoon]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bashore |first1=Nicholas |title=Here's Every New Character in 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe' |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/30945-mario-kart-8-deluxe-all-new-characters-gold-mario-unlock |website=Inverse |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |language=en |date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Courses===\nMany course themes recur throughout the series. Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out a petticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long train round their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their clothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the chin. The chevaliers d\u2019honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the equerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to the King. In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in motion; the King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was so short that the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at the end of a quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments, and untied the strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their tapestry, and I my book.\" <ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n[[File:Heinsius - Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France.jpg|thumb|left|Heinsius - Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France]]\n\nThe ''Mesdames'' had a good relationship with the children of their brother, and it was said that they \"proved that piety is not incompatible with intellectual charm.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>  \nIn 1770, the fourteen-year-old [[Marie-Antoinette]] became Dauphine by marriage to Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's nephew the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI of France. This marriage had been declared by Choiseul, advisory of the D\u00e9vot party and therefore of the ''Mesdames'', and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde declared that if she had any say, she would not have sent for an Austrian.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because of the close relationship between the Dauphin and his aunts, Marie Antoinette also initially came close to the Mesdames her first years in France as the senior royal women at court. The ''Mesdames'' used to alternate with the [[Princess Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy|Countess of Provence]] in accompanying Marie Antoinette on official assignments.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\"/>{{pn|date=March 2019}}\nMadame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde tried to win the Dauphine's support against Mme du Barry and repeatedly enticed the Dauphine to snub Madame du Barry. Being the first lady of the court, Madame du Barry could not speak to the Dauphine without being spoken to by her first and, encouraged by Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, Marie Antoinette refused to do so.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\" />{{pn|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1772, this state of affairs created a serious rift in the relationship between the King and Marie Antoinette, and Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] and her ambassador, concerned by the political consequences if this rift were to lead to a conflict between France and Austria, forced the Dauphine to agree to speak to Madame du Barry. The first time Marie Antoinette attempted to do so, however, she was interrupted by Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, requiring a second attempt before the Dauphine managed to speak to Madame du Barry, avoiding a rift in the Franco-Austrian alliance and thus thwarting the plot of Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\"/>{{pn|date=March 2019}}\nThis discontinued the friendship between Marie Antoinette and Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, who would bear subsequent malice toward Marie Antoinette and was reportedly the first person to call her \"the Austrian.\"\n\n===Reign of Louis XVI===\nFrom April 1774, Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and her sisters attended to their father Louis XV on his deathbed until his death from smallpox on 10 May. Despite the fact that the sisters never had the disease and the male members of the royal family, as well as the Dauphine, were kept away because of the high risk of catching the illness, the ''Mesdames'' were allowed to attend to him until his death, being female and therefore of no political importance because of the Salic Law even if they died. After the death of Louis XV, he was succeeded by his grandson Louis Auguste as [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], who referred to his aunts as ''Mesdames Tantes''.  \n[[Image:Madame adelaide de France.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France|Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de France]]''.]]\nMadame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde came to play a political role after the succession of her nephew. The sisters had in fact been infected by their father and fell ill with smallpox (from which they recovered), and were kept in quarantine on a little house near the Palace of Choisy, to which the court evacuated after the death of the king until their recovery.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 72\u201373\">{{cite book\n | author = Joan Haslip\n | title = Marie Antoinette\n | publisher =  \n | id = ISBN \n | year = 1991\n | pages=72\u201373 \n | language = \n}}</ref>  \nDespite this, however, Madame Adelaide had the time to intervene in the establishment of the new government: Louis XVI had been advised by his father to ask the advice of Adelaide should he become King, and after his succession, he sent her a letter and asked her advice on whom he should entrust his kingdom.,<ref name=\"Boigne, Louise-El\u00e9onore-Charlotte-Ad\u00e9laide d'Osmond\"/> and she replied with a list of names of minister candidates to him suggested by his father.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 72\u201373\"/>   After her brother the dauphin's death in 1765, followed in 1767 by that of his spouse, [[Marie-Jos\u00e8phe of Saxony|Marie-Jos\u00e8phe]], Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde took custody of the late dauphine's papers, with instructions concerning suitable ministers for their son, Louis Auguste, should he become king, and these papers were duly sent to Louis XVI, and opened on 12 May 1774. Three names were suggested for the position of Prime Minister; that of [[Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Maurepas]], [[Emmanuel-Armand de Richelieu, duc d'Aiguillon]], and [[Jean-Baptiste de Machault d'Arnouville]]. Madame Adelaide thus played an important role in the forming of the new government, and the recovery of her and her sisters from smallpox in late May was regretted by the friends of the ex-ministers, [[Madame du Deffand]] commenting: \"The avenging angel has shielded his sword.

They participated in the wagon train leaving the Palace of Versailles for Paris; however, their carriage separated from the rest of the procession on the way before they reached Paris, and they never took up residence at the Tuileries with the royal family, but preferred to retire to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue]] at [[Meudon]].<ref name=\"Boigne, Louise-El\u00e9onore-Charlotte-Ad\u00e9laide d'Osmond\"/>\n\nRevolutionary laws against the Catholic Church caused them to apply for passports from their nephew the king to travel on pilgrimage to the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome, and Louis XVI signed their passports and notified the [[Cardinal de Bernis]], the French Ambassador to Rome, of their arrival. On 3 February 1791, when they were about to leave, anonymous intimation of their intention was sent to the Jacobin Club, which caused a deputation of protest to the National Assembly. On 19 February, a crowd of women assembled at Palais Royal and agreed to march out to Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue and stop the Mesdames from departing.

The ''Chroniqle de Paris'' wrote: \"Two Princesses, sedentary by condition, age, and taste, are suddenly possessed by a mania for travelling and running about the world.

Their dress, and that of their suite, were old-fashioned, but unostentatious. The jewels they brought with them had been sold, one by one, to afford assistance to the poor emigr\u00e9es who applied to the princesses in their distress. They were highly respected by the Romans; not only by the higher orders, but by the common people, who had a horror of the French revolution, and no great partiality for that nation in general.\"<ref>Ellis Cornelia Knight,  ''[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographymi01kniggoog/autobiographymi01kniggoog_djvu.txt Autobiography of Miss Cornelia Knight, Lady Companion to the Princess]'', Harvard College Library, 1861</ref> When news came that Louis XVI and his family had left Paris on the [[Flight to Varennes]] in June, a misunderstanding first caused the impression that the escape had succeeded; at this news, \"the whole of Rome shouted with joy; the crowd massed itself under the windows of the Princesses crying out: Long live the King!\",<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/> and the Mesdames arranged a grand banquet for the nobility of Rome in celebration, which had to be interrupted when it was clarified that the escape had in fact failed.<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>\n\nUpon the invasion of Italy by Revolutionary France in 1796, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Victoire left Rome for [[Naples]], where Marie Antoinette's sister, [[Marie Caroline of Austria|Maria Carolina]], was queen, and settled at the Neapolitan royal court in the [[Palace of Caserta]].

After his success with ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) he never composed an Italian opera again. Almost blind, and having lived in England for nearly fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] in London.\n\nBorn the same year as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Domenico Scarlatti]], Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, with works such as ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', ''[[Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' remaining steadfastly popular.{{sfn|Buelow|2004|p=476}} One of his four [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|coronation anthems]], ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' (1727), composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], has been performed at every subsequent [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation]], traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Another of his English oratorios, ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'' (1748), has also remained popular, with the Sinfonia that opens act 3 (known more commonly as \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\") featuring at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 London Olympics opening ceremony]].

Mainwaring is the source for almost all information (little as it is) of Handel's childhood, and much of that information came from J.C.

To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\".{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=5}} Although both [[John Hawkins (author)|John Hawkins]] and [[Charles Burney]] credited this tale, Schoelcher found it nearly \"incredible\" and a feat of \"poetic imagination\"{{sfn|Schoelcher|1857|p=4}} and Lang considers it one of the unproven \"romantic stories\" that surrounded Handel's childhood.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=11}} But Handel had to have had some experience with the keyboard to have made the impression in Weissenfels that resulted in his receiving formal musical training.{{sfn|Dent|2004|pp=3\u20134}}\n\n=== Musical education ===\nSometime between the ages of seven and nine, Handel accompanied his father to [[Weissenfels]] where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor,{{sfn|Schoelcher|1857|p=5}} [[Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Duke Johann Adolf I]].{{efn|The year and purpose of the visit and why the meeting occurred is variously given.

He did this by requiring Handel to copy selected scores. \"I used to write like the devil in those days\", Handel recalled much later.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=12}} Much of this copying was entered into a notebook that Handel maintained for the rest of his life. Although it has since disappeared, the notebook has been sufficiently described to understand what pieces Zachow wished Handel to study.

The orphanage he founded became a model for Germany, and undoubtedly influenced Handel's own charitable impulse, when he assigned the rights of ''Messiah'' to London's Foundling Hospital.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Dom Halle.jpg|thumb|Domkirche in Halle]]\nShortly after commencing his university education, Handel (though Lutheran{{efn|Records of the Marktkirche show that he took communion there in April of the years 1701\u201303.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|pp=8, 9, 10}}.</ref>}}) on 13 March 1702 accepted the position of organist at the Calvinist Cathedral in Halle, the Domkirche, replacing J.C.

Four years Handel's senior, Telemann was studying law and assisting cantor [[Johann Kuhnau]] ([[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s predecessor at the [[Thomaskirche]] there). Telemann recalled forty years later in an autobiography for Mattheson's ''Grundlage'': \"The writing of the excellent Johann Kuhnau served as a model for me in fugue and counterpoint; but in fashioning melodic movements and examining them Handel and I were constantly occupied, frequently visiting each other as well as writing letters.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|pp=10\u201311}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=359}}.</ref>\n\n=== Halle compositions ===\nAlthough Mainwaring records that Handel wrote weekly when assistant to Zachow and as probationary organist at Domkirche part of his duty was to provide suitable music,{{efn|Handel was required by the terms of his appointment, among other things, \"to play the organ fittingly at Divine Service, and for this purpose to pre-intone the prescribed Psalms and Spiritual Songs, and to have due care to whatever might be needful to the support of beautiful harmony \u2026\"{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=9}}}} no sacred compositions from his Halle period can now be identified.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=22 n.2}} Mattheson, however, summarized his opinion of Handel's church cantatas written in Halle: \"Handel in those days set very, very long arias and sheerly unending cantatas which, while not possessing the proper knack or correct taste, were perfect so far as harmony is concerned.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|1966|p=22}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=93}}.</ref>\n\nEarly chamber works do exist, but it is difficult to date any of them to Handel's time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11).{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=4 n.1}} Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works \"show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli school]]\" and are notable for \"the formal security and the cleanness of the texture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}} Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on oboe.{{sfn|Hogwood|1984|p=21}}  That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works make their authenticity doubtful.{{sfn|Best|1985|pp=486\u201389}} Other early chamber works were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}}\n\n== From Halle to Italy ==\n[[File:Hamburgs Oper.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Opera am G\u00e4nsemarkt]] in 1726]]\n\nHandel's probationary appointment to Domkirche expired in March 1703.

Since he left no explanation for the move{{efn|Mainwaring gives the cryptic explanation that since he had to earn a living from his profession, he had to find a place less distant than Berlin. Given that Hamburg's opera house was second only to Berlin's in repute, \"it was resolved to send him thither on his own bottom, and chiefly with a view to improvement.\"{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=27\u201328}} The passage suggests that Handel had already determined on secular dramatic music as a career, but who it was \"to send him thither\" is not explained.}} biographers have offered their own speculation. Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concluded that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|pp=11\u201313}} The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=26}} Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors without considering himself a court servant.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=12}} And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother,{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=29}} Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\n\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]].

The board of chief investors expected Handel to retire when his contract ended, but Handel immediately looked for another theatre. In cooperation with [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] he started his third company at [[Covent Garden Theatre]]. Rich was renowned for his spectacular productions. He suggested Handel use his small chorus and introduce the dancing of [[Marie Sall\u00e9]], for whom Handel composed ''[[Terpsicore]]''. In 1735 he introduced organ concertos between the acts.

His most famous work, the oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music and has become the centrepiece of the Christmas season.

Also notable are his 16 keyboard suites, especially ''[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]''.\n\nHandel introduced previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the [[viola d'amore]] and [[violetta marina]] (''Orlando''), the lute (''Ode for St. Cecilia's Day''), three trombones (''Saul''), clarinets or small high cornetts (''Tamerlano''), [[theorbo]], French horn (''[[Water Music]]''), lyrichord, [[double bassoon]], [[viola da gamba]], [[carillon]] (bell chimes), [[positive organ]], and harp (''Giulio Cesare'', ''Alexander's Feast'').<ref>Textbook in CD ''Sacred Arias with Harp & Harp Duets by Rachel Ann Morgan & Edward Witsenburg.</ref>\n\n=== Catalogues ===\nThe first published catalogue of Handel's works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring's ''Memoirs''.{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=145\u201355}} Between 1787 and 1797 [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works\u2014however, it was far from complete.{{sfn|Dean|1982|p=116}} Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |title=A short history of editing Handel |author=The Halle Handel Edition |accessdate=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114021/http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 105-volume ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft]]'' (\"Handel Society\") edition was published between 1858 and 1902 \u2013 mainly due to the efforts of [[Friedrich Chrysander]].

It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera ''Serse'' was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}}\n\nBetween 1978 and 1986 the German academic [[Bernd Baselt]] catalogued Handel's works in his ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' publication.

Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (Handel)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.\n\nThe original form of his name, Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel, is generally used in Germany and elsewhere, but he is known as \"Haendel\" in France.

The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on \u2018See the conqu\u2019ring hero comes\u2019 from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed ''[[The Consecration of the House]]'' overture, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\n[[File:Handel-Westminster.png|thumb|left|upright|Handel's monument in Westminster Abbey with the plaque recording his [[Handel Commemoration|commemoration]] in 1784]]\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]).  Several works by the French composer [[F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.<ref>Auner Joseph H.

It was made at [[Denham Studios]] by the [[Rank Organisation]], and shot in [[Technicolor]].

Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concluded that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|pp=11\u201313}} The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=26}} Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors without considering himself a court servant.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=12}} And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother,{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=29}} Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\n\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]].

In addition to the Foundling Hospital, Handel also gave to a charity that assisted impoverished musicians and their families.\n\nIn August 1750, on a journey back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a carriage accident between [[The Hague]] and [[Haarlem]] in the Netherlands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=63}}</ref> In 1751 one eye started to fail.

His most famous work, the oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music and has become the centrepiece of the Christmas season. The [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in [[Prague]] holds [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] copy of ''Messiah'', complete with handwritten annotations. Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the [[Organ concertos, Op. 4 (Handel)|Organ concertos Op. 4]] and [[Organ concertos, Op. 7 (Handel)|Op. 7]], together with the [[Concerti Grossi, Op. 3 (Handel)|Opus 3]] and [[Concerti grossi, Op. 6 (Handel)|Opus 6 Concerti grossi]]; the latter incorporate an earlier organ concerto ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'' in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his 16 keyboard suites, especially ''[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]''.\n\nHandel introduced previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the [[viola d'amore]] and [[violetta marina]] (''Orlando''), the lute (''Ode for St. Cecilia's Day''), three trombones (''Saul''), clarinets or small high cornetts (''Tamerlano''), [[theorbo]], French horn (''[[Water Music]]''), lyrichord, [[double bassoon]], [[viola da gamba]], [[carillon]] (bell chimes), [[positive organ]], and harp (''Giulio Cesare'', ''Alexander's Feast'').<ref>Textbook in CD ''Sacred Arias with Harp & Harp Duets by Rachel Ann Morgan & Edward Witsenburg.</ref>\n\n=== Catalogues ===\nThe first published catalogue of Handel's works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring's ''Memoirs''.{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=145\u201355}} Between 1787 and 1797 [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works\u2014however, it was far from complete.{{sfn|Dean|1982|p=116}} Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |title=A short history of editing Handel |author=The Halle Handel Edition |accessdate=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114021/http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 105-volume ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft]]'' (\"Handel Society\") edition was published between 1858 and 1902 \u2013 mainly due to the efforts of [[Friedrich Chrysander]]. For modern performance, the realisation of the basso continuo reflects 19th century practice. Vocal scores drawn from the edition were published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in London, but some scores, such as the vocal score to ''Samson'', are incomplete.\n\nThe continuing ''[[Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe]]'' edition was first inaugurated in 1955 in the [[Halle (region)|Halle]] region in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Eastern Germany. It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera ''Serse'' was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}}\n\nBetween 1978 and 1986 the German academic [[Bernd Baselt]] catalogued Handel's works in his ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' publication. The catalogue has achieved wide acceptance and is used as the modern numbering system, with each of Handel's works designated an \"HWV\" number, for example ''Messiah'' is catalogued as \"HWV 56\".\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Masquerade at the King's Theatre Haymarket c1724.jpg|thumb|A Masquerade at the King's Theatre, Haymarket (c. 1724)]]\nHandel's works were collected and preserved by two men: [[Sir Samuel Hellier]], a country squire whose musical acquisitions form the nucleus of the Shaw-Hellier Collection,<ref>Best, Terence, ed.

The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated German versions of ''Messiah'' and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions.  The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of ''Messiah'' at [[The Crystal Palace]], involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blyth|first1=Alan|authorlink=Alan Blyth|title=Choral Music on Record|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=82}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=Handel - Zadok the Priest.ogg\n|title=Zadok the Priest (1727)\n|description=Composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1727, ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' has been performed at every subsequent [[British coronation]]}}\nRecent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (Handel)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.\n\nThe original form of his name, Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel, is generally used in Germany and elsewhere, but he is known as \"Haendel\" in France. A different composer, Jacob Handl or H\u00e4ndl (1550\u20131591) is usually known by the Latin form [[Jacobus Gallus]] that appears in his publications.\n\n=== Reception ===\nHandel has generally been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both in his own time and since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/13/composer6.shtml |title=BBC Press Release |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/13/composer6.shtml |archivedate=27 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=23}}</ref> [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] is reputed to have said of him, \"Handel understands [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] better than any of us.

Summarising the field in 2005, [[Richard Taruskin]] wrote that Handel \"seems to have been the champion of all [[Parody music|parodists]], adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unparalleled numbers and with unparalleled exactitude.\"<ref>[[Richard Taruskin]], ''The Oxford History of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2005, vol. 2, chapter 26, p. 329, {{ISBN|0195222717}}</ref> Among the composers whose music has been shown to have been re-used by Handel are [[Alessandro Stradella]], [[Gottlieb Muffat]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]]<ref>Alexander Silbiger, \"Scarlatti Borrowings in Handel's Grand Concertos\", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', v. 125, 1984, pp. 93\u201394</ref> [[Giacomo Carissimi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Heinrich Graun]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francesco Antonio Urio]], [[Reinhard Keiser]], [[Francesco Gasparini]], [[Giovanni Bononcini]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Henry Lawes]], [[Michael Wise]], [[Agostino Steffani]], Franz Johann Habermann, and numerous others.<ref>A comprehensive bibliography through 2005 can be found in Mary Anne Parker, ''G.

Roberts demonstrated that Handel's borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably [[Johann Mattheson]]); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel's practice, including Handel's attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and more radically, his \"basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas\" \u2013 though Roberts took care to argue that this does not \"diminish Handel's stature\", which should be \"judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.\"<ref>John H.

The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on \u2018See the conqu\u2019ring hero comes\u2019 from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed ''[[The Consecration of the House]]'' overture, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\n[[File:Handel-Westminster.png|thumb|left|upright|Handel's monument in Westminster Abbey with the plaque recording his [[Handel Commemoration|commemoration]] in 1784]]\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]).  Several works by the French composer [[F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.<ref>Auner Joseph H.

In the [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] Handel and Bach share that date with [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the [[Order of Saint Luke]] for the use of the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>''For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'', ed. by Clifton F.
