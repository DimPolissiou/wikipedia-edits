Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the numerous lands and kingdoms of the [[Habsburg dynasty]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] was the dominant form on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The dynastic capital was [[Vienna]], except from 1583 to 1611, when it was in [[Prague]].<ref name=HHus/>\n\n==Origins and expansion==\n[[File:Augsburg, Silver Medal 600th Anniversary of 1282 Hoftag, obverse.jpg|left|thumb|Silver medal by [[:de:Anton Scharff|Scharff]] commemorating the 600th anniversary of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1882 (obverse)]]\n\nThe Habsburg family originated with the [[Habsburg Castle]] in modern [[Switzerland]], and after 1279 came to rule in [[Austria]]. The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. According to the [[Habsburg]] ''compact'' of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in [[Brussels]], Ferdinand was made [[Archduke]] as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]  against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Louis at the [[First Congress of Vienna]]) was also elected the next King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Britannica2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"HHus\">\"Czech Republic \u2013 Historic Centre of Prague (1992)\" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070320190321/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}.</ref> Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] promulgated a ''Renewed Constitution'' (1627) that established hereditary succession over Bohemoa; and following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1687), in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] reconquered almost all of Hungary from the [[Ottoman Turks]], the emperor held a [[Diet of Hungary|diet in Pressburg]] to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nCharles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the [[Imperial election, 1531]]) and the [[Spanish empire]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a \"crownland\" after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the \"crownlands\" became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder'').\n\nThe Hungarian parts of the Empire were called \"[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]\" or \"Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Stephans Krone''). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790. The red line marks the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nThe territories ruled of the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:\n* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]].

In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).\n*[[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]]\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Europa regina]]'', symbolizing a Habsburg-dominated Europe]]\n[[File:Kraji\u0161nici, 1756. g.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Military Frontier]] against the incursions of the Ottoman Turks, 1756]]\nOver the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|Serbia]] occupation (1686\u20131691)\n* [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699\u20131868)\n* [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])\n* [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713\u20131792)\n* [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713\u20131797)\n* [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713\u20131735)\n* [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718\u20131739)\n* [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718\u20131778)\n* [[Oltenia]] (1718\u20131739 de facto, 1716\u20131737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'')\n* [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720\u20131735)\n* [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735\u20131748)\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772\u20131918)\n* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774\u20131918)\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia]] occupation (1788\u20131792)\n* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak\u00f3w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795\u20131809)\n* [[Venetian Province|Venetia]] (1797\u20131805)\n* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797\u20131805, 1814\u20131918)\n* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814\u20131859)\n* [[Krak\u00f3w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846\u20131918)\n* [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized\n* [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849\u20131860)\n* [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868\u20131918)\n* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] occupation (1878\u20131913)\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878\u20131918).\n\nThe boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.\n\n===Characteristics===\nWithin the early modern Habsburg Monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the numerous lands and kingdoms of the [[House of Habsburg]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] was the dominant form on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. According to the [[Habsburg]] ''compact'' of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in [[Brussels]], Ferdinand was made [[Archduke]] as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]  against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Louis at the [[First Congress of Vienna]]) was also elected the next King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Britannica2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"HHus\">\"Czech Republic \u2013 Historic Centre of Prague (1992)\" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070320190321/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}.</ref> Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] promulgated a ''Renewed Constitution'' (1627) that established hereditary succession over Bohemoa; and following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1687), in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] reconquered almost all of Hungary from the [[Ottoman Turks]], the emperor held a [[Diet of Hungary|diet in Pressburg]] to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nCharles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the [[Imperial election, 1531]]) and the [[Spanish empire]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790. The red line marks the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nThe territories ruled of the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:\n* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]]. The Hereditary provinces included:\n**[[Archduchy of Austria]] \n*** [[Upper Austria]]\n*** [[Lower Austria]]\n** [[Inner Austria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Styria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carinthia]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carniola]]\n*** The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port of [[Trieste]]\n*** [[March of Istria#Habsburg Margraviate|Margraviate of Istria]] (although much of Istria was [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory until 1797)\n*** [[Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca]]\n** [[County of Tyrol]] (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803)\n** [[Further Austria]], mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.\n*** [[Vorarlberg]] (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century)\n*** The [[Vorlande]], a group of territories in [[Breisgau]] and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1801 (although the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] territories ([[Sundgau]]) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648)\n** [[Grand Duchy of Salzburg]] (only after 1805)[[File:Maria Theresa-coronation-1741-Pressburg-Hertz.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Maria Theresa in Pressburg, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], 1741]]\n* The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. The Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] ({{lang-cs|zemsk\u00fd sn\u011bm}}) elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, as king in 1526. Initially consisting of the five lands: \n** [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] \n** [[Margraviate of Moravia]]\n** [[Silesia]], Most of Silesia was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740\u20131742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]] (Austrian Silesia).\n** [[Lusatia]], was ceded to [[Saxony]] in 1635.\n*** [[Upper Lusatia]]\n*** [[Lower Lusatia]]\n* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] \u2013 two-thirds of the former territory that was administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Princes of vassal Ottoman [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Transylvania]], while the Habsburg administration was restricted to the western and northern territories of the former kingdom, which remained to be officially referred as the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).\n*[[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]]\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Europa regina]]'', symbolizing a Habsburg-dominated Europe]]\n[[File:Kraji\u0161nici, 1756. g.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Military Frontier]] against the incursions of the Ottoman Turks, 1756]]\nOver the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|Serbia]] occupation (1686\u20131691)\n* [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699\u20131868)\n* [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])\n* [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713\u20131792)\n* [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713\u20131797)\n* [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713\u20131735)\n* [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718\u20131739)\n* [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718\u20131778)\n* [[Oltenia]] (1718\u20131739 de facto, 1716\u20131737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'')\n* [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720\u20131735)\n* [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735\u20131748)\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772\u20131918)\n* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774\u20131918)\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia]] occupation (1788\u20131792)\n* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak\u00f3w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795\u20131809)\n* [[Venetian Province|Venetia]] (1797\u20131805)\n* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797\u20131805, 1814\u20131918)\n* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814\u20131859)\n* [[Krak\u00f3w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846\u20131918)\n* [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized\n* [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849\u20131860)\n* [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868\u20131918)\n* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] occupation (1878\u20131913)\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878\u20131918).\n\nThe boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.\n\n===Characteristics===\nWithin the early modern Habsburg Monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\"/>\nSome of the residents also sold furs, obtained through [[Animal trapping|trapping]].\n\nThe settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch; when the post office opened in 1861 it was called York River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nila|title=Bancroft, a Bonanza of Memories|year=1979|publisher=Bancroft Centennial Committee|page=90|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=957965}}</ref> A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later.

In 1903, the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the [[wye junction]] joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905. Electricity was not available until 1930.<ref name=about/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com2\"/>\n\nUranium was discovered in 1949 and construction of the first mine (Faraday) started in 1952. The very large [[Madawaska Mine]] operated until 1982. Other minerals were also mined over the years.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/> The closing of the mine caused some economic hardship.

American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008.

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\"/>\nSome of the residents also sold furs, obtained through [[Animal trapping|trapping]].\n\nThe settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch; when the post office opened in 1861 it was called York River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nila|title=Bancroft, a Bonanza of Memories|year=1979|publisher=Bancroft Centennial Committee|page=90|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=957965}}</ref> A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later.

In 1903, the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the [[wye junction]] joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905.

American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedfordhousemovers.com/Tedford_House_Movers/Photo_Albums/Pages/Bancroft_Train_Station.html|title=Bancroft Train station lift|work=tedfordhousemovers.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club's museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdougallminerals.com/blog/tag/bancroft-railway-station/|title=Bancroft Railway Station \u00ab  McDougall Minerals|work=mcdougallminerals.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> and a [[caboose]], which is not currently in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosefm.com/chmss/news/use-of-the-caboose/|title=Use of the Caboose - My Bancroft Now|work=moosefm.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Print===\n*Bancroft Times, an independently-owned weekly (5000 copies, paid circulation) founded 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebancrofttimes.ca|title=Bancroft Times|work=thebancrofttimes.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Bancroft This Week]]\n*North Hastings Advertiser\n\n===Radio===\n\n* FM 97.7 - [[CHMS-FM]] (\"[[Vista Broadcast Group|Moose FM]]\"), [[Adult contemporary music|hot adult contemporary]]\n* FM 99.3 - [[CBLA-FM|CBLA-FM-5]], ''(formerly AM 600 [[List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada|CBLV]])'' [[CBC Radio One]];

The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700&nbsp;nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR [[laser]]s, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780&nbsp;nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050&nbsp;nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the [[Wood effect]] that consists of IR-glowing foliage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Sensitivity of the Human Eye to Infra-Red Radiation |journal= Journal of the Optical Society of America |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=546\u2013553 |year=1947 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.37.000546|pmid= 20256359 |last1=Griffin|first1=Donald R.|last2=Hubbard|first2=Ruth|last3=Wald|first3=George|bibcode= 1947JOSA...37..546G }}</ref>\n\n===Telecommunication bands in the infrared===\n\nIn [[optical communications]], the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramaswami |first=Rajiv |date=May 2002 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2002.1006983 |title=Optical Fiber Communication: From Transmission to Networking |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=138\u2013147 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Band\n!Descriptor\n!Wavelength range\n|-\n|O band\n|Original\n|1260\u20131360&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|E band\n|Extended\n|1360\u20131460&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|S band\n|Short wavelength\n|1460\u20131530&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|[[C band (infrared)|C band]]\n|Conventional\n|1530\u20131565&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|L band\n|Long wavelength\n|1565\u20131625&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|U band\n|Ultralong wavelength\n|1625\u20131675&nbsp;nm\n|}\n\nThe C-band is the dominant band for long-distance [[telecommunication]] networks.

Unlike heat transmitted by [[thermal conduction]] or [[thermal convection]], thermal radiation can propagate through a [[vacuum]]. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that are associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiation is associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the [[solar corona]]). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.\n\nThe concept of [[emissivity]] is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the idea of a [[black body]]. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature may not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler (assuming, as is often the case, that the surrounding environment is cooler then the objects being viewed). When an object has less than perfect emissivity, it obtains properties of reflectivity and/or transparency, and so the temperature of the surrounding environment is partially reflected by and/or transmitted through the object. If the object were in a hotter environment, then a lower emissivity object at the same temperature would likely appear to be hotter than a more emissive one. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity and not accounting for environmental temperatures will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.\n\n==Applications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\n===Night vision===\n{{Main|Night vision}}\n[[File:Active-Infrared-Night-Vision.jpg|thumb|Active-infrared night vision: the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the [[human eye]].

This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed [[pyrometry]]. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to greatly reduced production costs.\n\n[[Thermographic cameras]] detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900\u201314,000 nanometers or 0.9\u201314&nbsp;\u03bcm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black-body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \"see\" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).\n\n===Hyperspectral imaging===\n{{Main|Hyperspectral imaging}}\n\n[[File:Specim aisaowl outdoor.png|thumb|left| Hyperspectral thermal infrared [[Emission spectrum|emission]] measurement, an outdoor scan in winter conditions, ambient temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, image produced with a [[Specim]] LWIR hyperspectral imager.

Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.\n\nThermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a [[thermographic camera]], with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the Sun or the Moon.

[[Digital camera]]s often use infrared [[Filter (optics)|blockers]]. Cheaper digital cameras and [[camera phones]] have less effective filters and can \"see\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called '[[Terahertz radiation|T-ray]]' imaging, which is imaging using [[far-infrared]] or [[terahertz radiation]]. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].\n[[File:Infrared portrait comparison.jpg|thumb|Reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes.]]\n\n===Tracking===\n{{Main|Infrared homing}}\nInfrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a [[Passive homing|passive missile guidance system]], which uses the [[light emission|emission]] from a target of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the infrared part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \"heat-seekers\" since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mahulikar, S.P. |author2=Sonawane, H.R. |author3=Rao, G.A.|year=2007|title=Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|volume=43|issue=7\u20138|pages= 218\u2013245|url=http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/613/5740.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2007.06.002|bibcode = 2007PrAeS..43..218M |citeseerx=10.1.1.456.9135 }}</ref>\n\n===Heating===\n{{Main|Infrared heating}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nInfrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in [[infrared sauna]]s to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).<ref>White, Richard P. (2000) \"Infrared deicing system for aircraft\" {{US Patent|6092765}}</ref> Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around them.\n\nInfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.\n\nEfficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material.\n\n===Cooling===\n{{Main|Radiative cooling}}\nA variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere.\n\n===Communications===\n{{Further|Consumer IR}}\n\nIR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and [[personal digital assistant]]s. These devices usually conform to standards published by [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] into a narrow beam. The beam is [[modulation|modulated]], i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a [[silicon]] [[photodiode]] to convert the infrared radiation to an [[electric current]]. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for [[remote control]]s to command appliances.\nInfrared remote control protocols like [[RC-5]], [[Sony Infrared Remote Control|SIRC]], are used to communicate with infrared.\n\n[[Free space optical communication]] using infrared [[laser]]s can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage. \"Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.\"<ref>[http://www.ishn.com/articles/94815-dangers-of-overexposure-to-ultraviolet-infrared-and-high-energy-visible-light Dangers of Overexposure to ultraviolet, infrared and high-energy visible light | 2013-01-03]. ISHN. Retrieved on 2017-04-26.</ref>\n\nInfrared lasers are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330&nbsp;nm (least [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]) or 1,550&nbsp;nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.\n\nIR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]] project.\nTransmitting IR data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as [[beaming]].\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n[[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared vibrational spectroscopy]] (see also [[near-infrared spectroscopy]]) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH<sub>2</sub>) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in [[dipole]] in the molecule then it will absorb a [[photon]] that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study [[organic compound]]s using light radiation from 4000\u2013400&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>). The unit for expressing radiation in this application, cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, is the spectroscopic [[wavenumber]].  It is the frequency divided by the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n===Thin film metrology===\nIn the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations]]. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.\n\n===Meteorology===\n[[File:US IR satpic.JPG|thumb|left| IR satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15 October 2006. A [[weather front|frontal]] system can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with embedded cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower cumulus and stratocumulus can be seen off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].]]\n[[Weather satellite]]s equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3\u201312.5&nbsp;\u03bcm (IR4 and IR5 channels).\n\nHigh, cold ice clouds such as [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cumulonimbus]] show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] or [[stratocumulus]] show up as grey, with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or [[fog]] can have a temperature similar to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3\u201311.5&nbsp;\u03bcm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58\u20131.64&nbsp;\u03bcm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a ''fog'' satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.\n\nThese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even [[El Ni\u00f1o]] phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.\n\nThe main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08&nbsp;\u03bcm can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Climatology===\nIn the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into [[global warming]], together with [[solar radiation]].\n[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.55|Schematic of the [[greenhouse effect]]]]\n\nA [[pyrgeometer]] is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5&nbsp;\u03bcm and 50&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main|Infrared astronomy|far-infrared astronomy}}\n[[File:ESO - Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged (by).jpg|thumb|[[Beta Pictoris]] with its planet Beta Pictoris b, the light-blue dot off-center, as seen in infrared. It combines two images, the inner disc is at 3.6&nbsp;\u03bcm.]]\nAstronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of [[optical astronomy]]. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid [[helium]].\n\nThe sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected [[Infrared window|atmospheric window]]s. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.\n\nThe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark [[molecular cloud]]s of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect [[protostar]]s before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as [[planet]]s can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)\n\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of [[active galaxy|active galaxies]], which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high [[redshift]] will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.<ref name=\"ir_astronomy\" />\n\n===Infrared cleaning===\n[[Infrared cleaning]] is a technique used by some [[motion picture film scanner]]s, [[film scanner]]s and [[flatbed scanner]]s to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished [[image scanning|scan]]. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by [[inpainting]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107163528/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/dice.htm Digital ICE]. kodak.com</ref>\n\n===Art conservation and analysis===\n[[File:Infrared reflectograms of Mona Lisa.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|An infrared reflectogram of ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|frameless|right|upright=0.9]]\nInfrared reflectography<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sensorsinc.com/artanalysis.html |title=IR Reflectography for Non-destructive Analysis of Underdrawings in Art Objects |publisher=Sensors Unlimited, Inc. |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a non-destructive manner, in particular the artist's [[underdrawing]] or outline drawn as a guide.  Art conservators use the technique to examine how the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between (such alterations are called [[pentimento|pentimenti]] when made by the original artist). This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the [[prime version]] by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti, the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |title=The Mass of Saint Gregory: Examining a Painting Using Infrared Reflectography |publisher=The Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=2009-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113225836/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |archive-date=2009-01-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reflectography often reveals the artist's use of [[carbon black]], which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting.\n<!--this is somewhat pointless without an accompanying I.R.:  Among many other changes in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 (left), the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.

The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700&nbsp;nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR [[laser]]s, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780&nbsp;nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050&nbsp;nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the [[Wood effect]] that consists of IR-glowing foliage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Sensitivity of the Human Eye to Infra-Red Radiation |journal= Journal of the Optical Society of America |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=546\u2013553 |year=1947 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.37.000546|pmid= 20256359 |last1=Griffin|first1=Donald R.|last2=Hubbard|first2=Ruth|last3=Wald|first3=George|bibcode= 1947JOSA...37..546G }}</ref>\n\n===Telecommunication bands in the infrared===\n\nIn [[optical communications]], the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramaswami |first=Rajiv |date=May 2002 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2002.1006983 |title=Optical Fiber Communication: From Transmission to Networking |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=138\u2013147 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Band\n!Descriptor\n!Wavelength range\n|-\n|O band\n|Original\n|1260\u20131360&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|E band\n|Extended\n|1360\u20131460&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|S band\n|Short wavelength\n|1460\u20131530&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|[[C band (infrared)|C band]]\n|Conventional\n|1530\u20131565&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|L band\n|Long wavelength\n|1565\u20131625&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|U band\n|Ultralong wavelength\n|1625\u20131675&nbsp;nm\n|}\n\nThe C-band is the dominant band for long-distance [[telecommunication]] networks.

Unlike heat transmitted by [[thermal conduction]] or [[thermal convection]], thermal radiation can propagate through a [[vacuum]]. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that are associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiation is associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the [[solar corona]]). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.\n\nThe concept of [[emissivity]] is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the idea of a [[black body]]. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature may not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler (assuming, as is often the case, that the surrounding environment is cooler then the objects being viewed). When an object has less than perfect emissivity, it obtains properties of reflectivity and/or transparency, and so the temperature of the surrounding environment is partially reflected by and/or transmitted through the object. If the object were in a hotter environment, then a lower emissivity object at the same temperature would likely appear to be hotter than a more emissive one. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity and not accounting for environmental temperatures will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.\n\n==Applications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\n===Night vision===\n{{Main|Night vision}}\n[[File:Active-Infrared-Night-Vision.jpg|thumb|Active-infrared night vision: the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the [[human eye]].

This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed [[pyrometry]]. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to greatly reduced production costs.\n\n[[Thermographic cameras]] detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900\u201314,000 nanometers or 0.9\u201314&nbsp;\u03bcm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black-body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \"see\" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).\n\n===Hyperspectral imaging===\n{{Main|Hyperspectral imaging}}\n\n[[File:Specim aisaowl outdoor.png|thumb|left| Hyperspectral thermal infrared [[Emission spectrum|emission]] measurement, an outdoor scan in winter conditions, ambient temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, image produced with a [[Specim]] LWIR hyperspectral imager. Relative radiance spectra from various targets in the image are shown with arrows. The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectra]] of the different objects such as the watch clasp have clearly distinctive characteristics. The contrast level indicates the temperature of the object.<ref name=Holma>Holma, H., (May 2011), [http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=11&np=5&artid=848&L=1 Thermische Hyperspektralbildgebung im langwelligen Infrarot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171326/http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=11&np=5&artid=848&L=1 |date=2011-07-26 }}, Photonik</ref>]]\n[[File:Blue infrared light.jpg|thumb|Infrared light from the [[LED]] of a [[remote control]] as recorded by a digital camera]]\n\nA hyperspectral image is a \"picture\" containing continuous [[Infrared spectroscopy|spectrum]] through a wide spectral range at each pixel. Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.\n\nThermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a [[thermographic camera]], with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the Sun or the Moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor surveillance and [[UAV]] applications.<ref name=\"Frost&Sullivan Specim Owl\">Frost&Sullivan, Technical Insights, Aerospace&Defence (Feb 2011): [http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/segment-toc.pag?segid=D870-00-48-00-00&ctxixpLink=FcmCtx3&ctxixpLabel=FcmCtx4 World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles].</ref>\n\n===Other imaging===\nIn [[infrared photography]], [[infrared filter]]s are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. [[Digital camera]]s often use infrared [[Filter (optics)|blockers]]. Cheaper digital cameras and [[camera phones]] have less effective filters and can \"see\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called '[[Terahertz radiation|T-ray]]' imaging, which is imaging using [[far-infrared]] or [[terahertz radiation]]. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].\n[[File:Infrared portrait comparison.jpg|thumb|Reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes.]]\n\n===Tracking===\n{{Main|Infrared homing}}\nInfrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a [[Passive homing|passive missile guidance system]], which uses the [[light emission|emission]] from a target of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the infrared part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \"heat-seekers\" since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mahulikar, S.P. |author2=Sonawane, H.R. |author3=Rao, G.A.|year=2007|title=Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|volume=43|issue=7\u20138|pages= 218\u2013245|url=http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/613/5740.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2007.06.002|bibcode = 2007PrAeS..43..218M |citeseerx=10.1.1.456.9135 }}</ref>\n\n===Heating===\n{{Main|Infrared heating}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nInfrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in [[infrared sauna]]s to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).<ref>White, Richard P. (2000) \"Infrared deicing system for aircraft\" {{US Patent|6092765}}</ref> Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around them.\n\nInfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.\n\nEfficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material.\n\n===Cooling===\n{{Main|Radiative cooling}}\nA variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere.\n\n===Communications===\n{{Further|Consumer IR}}\n\nIR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and [[personal digital assistant]]s. These devices usually conform to standards published by [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] into a narrow beam. The beam is [[modulation|modulated]], i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a [[silicon]] [[photodiode]] to convert the infrared radiation to an [[electric current]]. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for [[remote control]]s to command appliances.\nInfrared remote control protocols like [[RC-5]], [[Sony Infrared Remote Control|SIRC]], are used to communicate with infrared.\n\n[[Free space optical communication]] using infrared [[laser]]s can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage. \"Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.\"<ref>[http://www.ishn.com/articles/94815-dangers-of-overexposure-to-ultraviolet-infrared-and-high-energy-visible-light Dangers of Overexposure to ultraviolet, infrared and high-energy visible light | 2013-01-03]. ISHN. Retrieved on 2017-04-26.</ref>\n\nInfrared lasers are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330&nbsp;nm (least [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]) or 1,550&nbsp;nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.\n\nIR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]] project.\nTransmitting IR data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as [[beaming]].\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n[[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared vibrational spectroscopy]] (see also [[near-infrared spectroscopy]]) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH<sub>2</sub>) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in [[dipole]] in the molecule then it will absorb a [[photon]] that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study [[organic compound]]s using light radiation from 4000\u2013400&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>). The unit for expressing radiation in this application, cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, is the spectroscopic [[wavenumber]].  It is the frequency divided by the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n===Thin film metrology===\nIn the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations]]. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.\n\n===Meteorology===\n[[File:US IR satpic.JPG|thumb|left| IR satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15 October 2006. A [[weather front|frontal]] system can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with embedded cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower cumulus and stratocumulus can be seen off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].]]\n[[Weather satellite]]s equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3\u201312.5&nbsp;\u03bcm (IR4 and IR5 channels).\n\nHigh, cold ice clouds such as [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cumulonimbus]] show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] or [[stratocumulus]] show up as grey, with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or [[fog]] can have a temperature similar to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3\u201311.5&nbsp;\u03bcm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58\u20131.64&nbsp;\u03bcm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a ''fog'' satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.\n\nThese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even [[El Ni\u00f1o]] phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.\n\nThe main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08&nbsp;\u03bcm can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Climatology===\nIn the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into [[global warming]], together with [[solar radiation]].\n[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.55|Schematic of the [[greenhouse effect]]]]\n\nA [[pyrgeometer]] is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5&nbsp;\u03bcm and 50&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main|Infrared astronomy|far-infrared astronomy}}\n[[File:ESO - Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged (by).jpg|thumb|[[Beta Pictoris]] with its planet Beta Pictoris b, the light-blue dot off-center, as seen in infrared. It combines two images, the inner disc is at 3.6&nbsp;\u03bcm.]]\nAstronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of [[optical astronomy]]. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid [[helium]].\n\nThe sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected [[Infrared window|atmospheric window]]s. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.\n\nThe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark [[molecular cloud]]s of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect [[protostar]]s before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as [[planet]]s can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)\n\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of [[active galaxy|active galaxies]], which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high [[redshift]] will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.<ref name=\"ir_astronomy\" />\n\n===Infrared cleaning===\n[[Infrared cleaning]] is a technique used by some [[motion picture film scanner]]s, [[film scanner]]s and [[flatbed scanner]]s to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished [[image scanning|scan]]. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by [[inpainting]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107163528/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/dice.htm Digital ICE]. kodak.com</ref>\n\n===Art conservation and analysis===\n[[File:Infrared reflectograms of Mona Lisa.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|An infrared reflectogram of ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|frameless|right|upright=0.9]]\nInfrared reflectography<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sensorsinc.com/artanalysis.html |title=IR Reflectography for Non-destructive Analysis of Underdrawings in Art Objects |publisher=Sensors Unlimited, Inc. |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a non-destructive manner, in particular the artist's [[underdrawing]] or outline drawn as a guide.  Art conservators use the technique to examine how the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between (such alterations are called [[pentimento|pentimenti]] when made by the original artist). This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the [[prime version]] by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti, the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |title=The Mass of Saint Gregory: Examining a Painting Using Infrared Reflectography |publisher=The Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=2009-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113225836/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |archive-date=2009-01-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reflectography often reveals the artist's use of [[carbon black]], which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting.\n<!--this is somewhat pointless without an accompanying I.R.:  Among many other changes in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 (left), the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.  Common metals include [[brass]], plated brass, [[nickel silver]], and [[steel]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n[[File:Lock MET cdi55-61-5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Gothic art|Gothic]] lock, from the 15th\u201316th centuries, made of iron, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nThe earliest known lock and key device was discovered in the ruins of Nineveh, the capital of ancient [[Assyria]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last=de Vries, N.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded \u00a3100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/lock_making2|title=Lock Making: Chubb & Son's Lock & Safe Co Ltd|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|year=2005|accessdate=16 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] in starting their own lock company, [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.

The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded \u00a3100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/lock_making2|title=Lock Making: Chubb & Son's Lock & Safe Co Ltd|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|year=2005|accessdate=16 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] in starting their own lock company, [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.

The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].

Each installment was typically four panels (but with frequent variation), usually with a comedic gag at the end, but with ongoing storylines.\n\nIn 1989, inspired by cartoonists such as [[Dave Sim]] who were successfully self-publishing their comics, Wagner began publishing ''Hepcats'' as a black-and-white comic book series, under his own Double Diamond Press imprint. In this format, the series took on the highly detailed pen-and-ink artwork that would become one of its distinguishing features. Wagner immediately began experimenting with page layouts, including turning the pages sideways, using a double-page spread for each layout for issue #2. Issue #3 began what was intended to be an 18-part [[graphic novel]] entitled ''Snowblind''. Critics have frequently cited Sim's ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' as an artistic influence on this material.\n\nThough critically acclaimed, with a cult following, the series was not a financial success, and this led to an erratic publishing schedule that frustrated readers. In comments written later, in the summer of 1996, Wagner cited poor sales, his weak business skills, and his 1991 divorce as the causes of a financial \"hole\" he was struggling to get out of. Despite Wagner's increasing prominence as one of several acclaimed self-publishers of the period \u2013 along with [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), [[Colleen Doran]] (''[[A Distant Soil]]''), [[James A. Owen]] (''[[Starchild (comics)|Starchild]]''), and Sim (''Cerebus'') \u2014 the series stalled after issue #12 in 1994. Collections of the ''Daily Texan'' strips and of the first volume of ''Snowblind'' were released, but Wagner said those sales were not enough to make continuation of the series financially viable.\n\nIn 1996 Wagner signed a deal with [[Antarctic Press]] to republish the series to date, along with new issues.<ref>\"Newswatch: Antarctic Press to Publish Hepcats,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #187 (May 1996), p. 28.</ref> Antarctic republished the original 12 issues from 1996 to 1998; A color \"#0\" issue was released to launch this reprint series, but it was the last new material published. Wagner claimed to have finished issue #13, but in a 1999 interview in [[Beau Yarbrough]]'s \"Comics Wire\" at [[Comic Book Resources]], he stated that the \"pitiful\" advance orders for that issue had led him to look for another way to make a living. Shortly after the cancellation of these orders, however, Antarctic employee Matthew High stated that these orders were in line with the publisher's expectations and that Wagner had never turned in any art for #13.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Wagner left the comics industry in 1998.\n\nIn 2006, Wagner announced that he would be finishing the ''Snowblind'' storyline as a webcomic. By the end of 2010 he admitted to regretting that announcement, as he was busy with paying work and the series was not high on his leisure-time priorities list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hepcats.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/and-here-we-are-a-year-later/ |title=And here we are, a year later! &#124; Martin Wagner's Hepcats |publisher=Hepcats.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> In 2008, to tide fans over while waiting for ''Snowblind'' to appear, he began work on an 8-page mini-comic unrelated to the ''Snowblind'' storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28515612@N06/sets/72157606115446377/ |title=Hepcats Minicomic 2008 #1 \u2013 a set on Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hepcats.wordpress.com/2008/07/12/posting-the-new-hepcats-minicomic/ |title=Posting the new Hepcats minicomic! &#124; Martin Wagner's Hepcats |publisher=Hepcats.wordpress.com |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> The minicomic was also not completed, updates ceasing after page 5, also because of work commitments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hepcats.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/no-news-is-no-news/ |title=No news is no news &#124; Martin Wagner's Hepcats |publisher=Hepcats.wordpress.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Collected volumes==\n*''Yo: The First Hepcats Book'' (1988; collection of ''Daily Texan'' strips\u2014cover spoofs sleeve of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s album ''[[So (album)|So]]'')\n*''The Collegiate Hepcats'' (1993; complete collection of all ''Daily Texan'' strips, plus ''Hepcats'' #1 and some pre-Hepcats work from the University of Houston paper)\n*''Snowblind, Part One'' (1995; collecting ''Hepcats'' #3\u201310, first half of unfinished ''Snowblind'' graphic novel)\n\nNot reprinted in any of these collections are #2 (the sideways issue, reprinted in a \"Special Edition\" in 1994), and issues #11 (a 42-page story with a black on dark-gray cover, a dramatic turning point in the story) and #12 (the final issue to see print).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hepcats.wordpress.com Official site]\n* {{gcdb series|id= 3937 |title=Hepcats}} (Double Diamond)\n* {{gcdb series|id= 7914 |title=Hepcats}} (Antarctic Press)\n*[http://hepcats.comicgenesis.com Fan site by Stephanie Krus posting entire original series run]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185642/http://www.flowerfire.com/seized/comics/hepcats/ Review on flowerfire.com]\n\n{{italic title}}\n\n[[Category:Antarctic Press titles]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Comic}}\n{{Other uses|Hepcat (disambiguation){{!}}Hepcat}}\n{{Infobox comic book title\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| title               = Hepcats\n| image               = <!-- filename format only -->\n| image_size          = <!-- default 250 -->\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| schedule            = Irregular\n| format              = Standard black-and-white\n| limited             =\n| ongoing             = y\n| 1shot               = \n| genre               = [[Furry comics|Furry]]\n| publisher           = Double Diamond Press\n| date                = \n| startmo             = May 26\n| startyr             = 1989\n| endmo               = September\n| endyr               = 1994\n| issues              = 12\n| main_char_team      =\n| issn                = \n| writers             = \n| artists             = \n| pencillers          = \n| inkers              = \n| letterers           = \n| colorists           = \n| editors             = \n| creative_team_month = \n| creative_team_year  = \n| creators            = [[Martin Wagner (artist)|Martin Wagner]]\n| CEheader            = \n| TPB                 = The Collegiate Hepcats\n| ISBN                = 978-0963666017\n| TPB1 = Snowblind, Part One\n| ISBN1 = 9780963666024 \n|TPB2 = \n|ISBN2 = \n| subcat              = \n| altcat              = \n| sort                = Hepcats\n| addpubcat#          = \n| nonUS               = \n}}\n'''''Hepcats''''' is a [[comic book]] series [[self-publishing|self-published]] in the 1990s by cartoonist [[Martin Wagner (artist)|Martin Wagner]].

The JWST is oriented toward [[infrared astronomy|near-infrared astronomy]], but can also see orange and red visible light, as well as the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument. The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for three main reasons: High-[[redshift]] objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as [[debris disk]]s and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.  Ground-based telescopes must look through the atmosphere, which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure of atmospheric transmission).  Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane, also exist in the Earth's atmosphere, vastly complicating analysis. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are not cool enough (the Hubble mirror is maintained at about {{convert|15|C|K}}) and hence the telescope itself radiates strongly in the infrared bands.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe JWST will operate near the Earth\u2013Sun [[Lagrangian point#L2|L<sub>2</sub> (Lagrange) point]], approximately {{Convert|930000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} beyond Earth's orbit. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits {{Convert|340|mi|order=flip}} above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly {{Convert|250000|mi|order=flip}} from Earth. This distance makes post-launch repair or upgrade of the JWST hardware virtually impossible. Objects near this point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distance<ref name=\"stsci.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/design/orbit |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140203174537/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/design/orbit |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2014 |title=L2 Orbit |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |accessdate=28 August 2016  }}</ref> and use a single sunshield to block heat and light from the Sun and Earth.

By 2006, $1 billion had been spent on developing JWST, with the budget at about $4.5 billion at that time. A 2006 article in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] noted a study in 1984 by the Space Science Board, which estimated that a next generation infrared observatory would cost $4 billion (about $7 billion in 2006 dollars).<ref name=\"nature06\"/> By October 2019, the estimated cost of the project had reached $10 billion for launch in 2021.<ref name=\"Laura Mallonee 2019, p 24\"/>\n\nThe telescope was originally estimated to cost $1.6 billion,<ref name=\"FLTodayJun11\" /> but the cost estimate grew throughout the early development and had reached about $5 billion by the time the mission was formally confirmed for construction start in 2008. In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland US Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] to call for an independent review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of $1.5bn (for a total of $6.5bn). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf | title=Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, Final Report | date=29 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed $1.9bn from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for JWST.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope | title=Nasa fights to save the James Webb space telescope from the axe | publisher=The Guardian | date=9 July 2011 | location=London | first=Robin | last=McKie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://appropriations.house.gov/news/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023 | title=Appropriations Committee Releases the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations | publisher=US House of representatives Committee on Appropriations | date=6 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html| title=US lawmakers vote to kill Hubble successor | publisher=SpaceDaily | date=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html | title=Proposed NASA Budget Bill Would Cancel Major Space Telescope | publisher=Space.com | date=6 July 2011}}</ref> $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Bergin| first1=Chris| title=James Webb Space Telescope hardware entering key test phase| url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/| website=NASASpaceflight.com| date=7 January 2015| accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day.

This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html | title = Infrared Atmospheric Windows | accessdate=28 August 2016| publisher = Cool Cosmos}}</ref>\n\nThe more distant an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers.

The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for three main reasons: High-[[redshift]] objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as [[debris disk]]s and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.  Ground-based telescopes must look through the atmosphere, which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure of atmospheric transmission).  Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane, also exist in the Earth's atmosphere, vastly complicating analysis. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are not cool enough (the Hubble mirror is maintained at about {{convert|15|C|K}}) and hence the telescope itself radiates strongly in the infrared bands.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe JWST will operate near the Earth\u2013Sun [[Lagrangian point#L2|L<sub>2</sub> (Lagrange) point]], approximately {{Convert|930000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} beyond Earth's orbit. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits {{Convert|340|mi|order=flip}} above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly {{Convert|250000|mi|order=flip}} from Earth. This distance makes post-launch repair or upgrade of the JWST hardware virtually impossible. Objects near this point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distance<ref name=\"stsci.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/design/orbit |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140203174537/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/design/orbit |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2014 |title=L2 Orbit |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |accessdate=28 August 2016  }}</ref> and use a single sunshield to block heat and light from the Sun and Earth.

By 2006, $1 billion had been spent on developing JWST, with the budget at about $4.5 billion at that time. A 2006 article in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] noted a study in 1984 by the Space Science Board, which estimated that a next generation infrared observatory would cost $4 billion (about $7 billion in 2006 dollars).<ref name=\"nature06\"/> By October 2019, the estimated cost of the project had reached $10 billion for launch in 2021.<ref name=\"Laura Mallonee 2019, p 24\"/>\n\nThe telescope was originally estimated to cost $1.6 billion,<ref name=\"FLTodayJun11\" /> but the cost estimate grew throughout the early development and had reached about $5 billion by the time the mission was formally confirmed for construction start in 2008. In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland US Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] to call for an independent review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of $1.5bn (for a total of $6.5bn). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf | title=Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, Final Report | date=29 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed $1.9bn from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for JWST.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope | title=Nasa fights to save the James Webb space telescope from the axe | publisher=The Guardian | date=9 July 2011 | location=London | first=Robin | last=McKie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://appropriations.house.gov/news/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023 | title=Appropriations Committee Releases the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations | publisher=US House of representatives Committee on Appropriations | date=6 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html| title=US lawmakers vote to kill Hubble successor | publisher=SpaceDaily | date=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html | title=Proposed NASA Budget Bill Would Cancel Major Space Telescope | publisher=Space.com | date=6 July 2011}}</ref> $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Bergin| first1=Chris| title=James Webb Space Telescope hardware entering key test phase| url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/| website=NASASpaceflight.com| date=7 January 2015| accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day.

JWST will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies.<ref name=RHowardJWST>Howard, Rick, [https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/629955main_RHoward_JWST_3_6_12.pdf \"James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\"], ''nasa.gov'', 6 March 2012.</ref> Observing in the infrared is a key technique for achieving this because of [[redshift|cosmological redshift]] and because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas. This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html | title = Infrared Atmospheric Windows | accessdate=28 August 2016| publisher = Cool Cosmos}}</ref>\n\nThe more distant an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the [[Metric expansion of space|universe is expanding]], as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and objects at extreme distances are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared.<ref name=\"ir_astronomy\"/> JWST's infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the [[Big Bang]].<ref name=\"firstlight\">{{cite web| url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/firstlight.html|title=Webb Science: The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nInfrared radiation can pass more freely through regions of [[cosmic dust]] that scatter visible light.

He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]].
