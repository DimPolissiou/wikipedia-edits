However, Exotic, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Exotic and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Exotic. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Exotic acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.

He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls.<ref name=\"NATGEO\"/> \n\nIn 2006, the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park was cited multiple times by the [[Usda|USDA]] for violations of [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] standards.<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite news |title=AWA Docket No. 05-0014 Consent Decision and Order |url=https://oalj.oha.usda.gov/sites/default/files/AWA_05-0014_012606.pdf |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |website=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=January 26, 2006}}</ref> In 2011, [[Carole Baskin]], founder of [[Big Cat Rescue]] sanctuary in Florida, organized protests against his use of cubs in his shows.

By this point, the relationship between Exotic and Hartpence had deteriorated, due to drug and alcohol addiction.

He grew up on a working farm in [[Kansas]]. When he was five years old, he was raped by an older boy.<ref name=\"Intelligencer\"/> He and his family moved to Texas where he joined the [[Eastvale, Texas]] police department, soon becoming chief of the small department.

However, Exotic, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died of shock. Exotic and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Exotic. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Exotic acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him. He would shoot the horses and feed them whole to the tigers, lions, and other big cats.<ref name=\"Intelligencer\" />\n\nFor over 20 years, he was known as Joe Exotic, the owner and operator of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]], known for its big cats. He operated an online reality television show that he streamed from his zoo. Over the years, he operated sideshows around the country where he allowed people to pet tiger cubs. He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls.<ref name=\"NATGEO\"/> \n\nIn 2006, the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park was cited multiple times by the [[Usda|USDA]] for violations of [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] standards.<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite news |title=AWA Docket No. 05-0014 Consent Decision and Order |url=https://oalj.oha.usda.gov/sites/default/files/AWA_05-0014_012606.pdf |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |website=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=January 26, 2006}}</ref> In 2011, [[Carole Baskin]], founder of [[Big Cat Rescue]] sanctuary in Florida, organized protests against his use of cubs in his shows.

Baskin sued Exotic for trademark infringement and eventually won $1 million in settlements against Exotic.<ref name=\"NATGEO\"/>\n\n===Music===\nExotic was an aspiring country singer and he had several albums recorded and then made music videos to make it seem as if he was playing and singing.

In the summer of 2003, John Finlay was hired as an employee of the G. W. Zoo, and within a month, had begun a relationship with Exotic. By this point, the relationship between Exotic and Hartpence had deteriorated, due to drug and alcohol addiction. It finally ended after Exotic threatened to kill Hartpence and feed his remains to the zoo's largest tiger, and when Hartpence woke Exotic up by putting a gun to his head, leading to his arrest by the local authorities.

He is one of the finest raagis having knowledge of all the 31 Raags in Gurbani of Dhan We still do not know how he passed away. Some people say it is because of the coronavirus and some say that it was the doctors fault. Whatever it was we hope that he body rests in peace. And his funeral was one of the worst funeral you could imagine. Only his son and a few doctors and couple other people come. Because they were afraid that people would catch the virus. And his actual funeral was in the middle of a highway. We miss you baba ji!

He quickly climbs up the large majestic tree, and ends up meeting a mysterious young girl whom he ignores initially. He decides to ask her who she is, only to discover that she was the Guardian Saint protecting the fountain. Swiftly, she swings her hand and the winds blow Ban off the tree. However, Ban survives the fall and persistently continues to climb up again. He repeatedly climbs up and gets blown off, until both of them grows extremely annoyed. In order to obtain the fountain, Ban equips himself with his Nunchaku, leading Elaine to believe that he was planning to kill and steal like all other humans. To her surprise, he quickly grabs the Fountain of Youth and begins drinking. But before he could even take a sip, Elaine manipulates the tree branches and immobilizes him by grabbing all of his limbs. She then persuades him that without the Fountain of Youth, the forest itself will die. Astonishingly, Ban replies straightforwardly, stating that he understands. When Elaine decides to read his heart, she discovers that he really had the intentions of giving up. She releases him and the two begin to get to know each other. Ban tells her that the reason for stealing the fountain is to hope for something good to happen in his life. In response, she replies saying that she already lived for over 700 years, protecting the cup in place of her brother, King, who abandoned her. Ban decides to show her his ale label collection and the two bonded over a span of 7 days. Suddenly, when Ban was away, she quietly whispers that she wished that he had come to steal her instead of the Fountain of Youth. She was startled to discover Ban behind her, who had heard what she said, and realized that they both have similar thoughts and feelings. Out of the blue, a mysterious monster from the Demon Clan appears, burning the forest with its Purgatory Fire. Ban immediately confronts the monster after telling Elaine to escape with the fountain, and successfully robs one of its hearts. Not realizing that it had more than one heart, he lets down his guard and as a result, both of them get severely injured by the monster. Both of them realize that the only way to survive was to drink the Fountain of Youth, which means that only one of them could live. The two of them wanted each other to drink the fountain, hoping for their survival. In desperation, Elaine seemingly drinks the liquid, only to kiss Ban and deliver it to him directly. Ban immediately recovers from the injuries after consuming the liquid, and quickly defeats the monster in rage. Before passing away, Elaine gives him the forest's last seed and he repeats, Someday, I'll definitely make you mine. Sadly, before he was able to finish the phrase, she was gone.

He quickly climbs up the large majestic tree, and ends up meeting a mysterious young girl whom he ignores initially. He decides to ask her who she is, only to discover that she was the Guardian Saint protecting the fountain. Swiftly, she swings her hand and the winds blow Ban off the tree. However, Ban survives the fall and persistently continues to climb up again. He repeatedly climbs up and gets blown off, until both of them grows extremely annoyed. In order to obtain the fountain, Ban equips himself with his Nunchaku, leading Elaine to believe that he was planning to kill and steal like all other humans. To her surprise, he quickly grabs the Fountain of Youth and begins drinking. But before he could even take a sip, Elaine manipulates the tree branches and immobilizes him by grabbing all of his limbs. She then persuades him that without the Fountain of Youth, the forest itself will die. Astonishingly, Ban replies straightforwardly, stating that he understands. When Elaine decides to read his heart, she discovers that he really had the intentions of giving up. She releases him and the two begin to get to know each other. Ban tells her that the reason for stealing the fountain is to hope for something good to happen in his life. In response, she replies saying that she already lived for over 700 years, protecting the cup in place of her brother, King, who abandoned her. Ban decides to show her his ale label collection and the two bonded over a span of 7 days. Suddenly, when Ban was away, she quietly whispers that she wished that he had come to steal her instead of the Fountain of Youth. She was startled to discover Ban behind her, who had heard what she said, and realized that they both have similar thoughts and feelings. Out of the blue, a mysterious monster from the Demon Clan appears, burning the forest with its Purgatory Fire. Ban immediately confronts the monster after telling Elaine to escape with the fountain, and successfully robs one of its hearts. Not realizing that it had more than one heart, he lets down his guard and as a result, both of them get severely injured by the monster. Both of them realize that the only way to survive was to drink the Fountain of Youth, which means that only one of them could live. The two of them wanted each other to drink the fountain, hoping for their survival. In desperation, Elaine seemingly drinks the liquid, only to kiss Ban and deliver it to him directly. Ban immediately recovers from the injuries after consuming the liquid, and quickly defeats the monster in rage. Before passing away, Elaine gives him the forest's last seed and he repeats, Someday, I'll definitely make you mine. Sadly, before he was able to finish the phrase, she was gone. Later on, somewhere within the Kingdom of Liones, Ban is judged and sentenced to death for his apparent sins of destroying the Fairy King's Forest, taking the Fountain of Youth and killing the Guardian Saint.

These are their problems.\" The series focuses on siblings Wayne and Katy,{{efn|Katy was created for the TV series, though she was obliquely referenced in an unnamed capacity in the web series.}} who run a small farm and produce stand with help from Wayne's friends Daryl and Squirrely Dan.{{efn|Daryl and Squirrely Dan were both created for the TV series.}} It also focuses on ice hockey players Reilly and Jonesy, two best friends who are involved in an [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-and-off]] [[polyamorous]] relationship with Katy. Episodes deal with small-town life amongst different types of people: the farmers (the \"hicks\"), the out-of-towners who make up the local ice hockey team, the town's [[closeted]] minister, the drug addicts (the \"skids\"), members of the nearby [[First Nations|First Nation]] reserve (the \"natives\"), and the local [[Mennonites]]. Plots often revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as \"the toughest guy in Letterkenny\", the exploits of the town's hockey team who rarely win, Wayne's attempts to break up Katy's relationships with various men he dislikes, the skids' schemes to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the natives, and Wayne's dating life after dumping his high school sweetheart who cheated on him. In an effort to subvert the usual [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] of small-town residents having lower intelligence levels, one of the show's running jokes is that almost every character possesses the ability to think quickly and come up with a near-constant barrage of wordplay and puns.\n\n==Production==\n''Letterkenny'' is the first original series commissioned by [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]],<ref name=\"wfp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/TV/Crave-TV-orders-up-first-original-series-Letterkenny-295212911.html |title=Crave TV orders up first original series: Letterkenny |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=March 5, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> and premiered on that platform on February 7, 2016.<ref name=\"570 News\">{{cite web |url=https://www.570news.com/2015/11/09/tv-show-letterkenny-staring-listowels-jared-keeso-has-a-launch-date/ |title=TV Show \"Letterkenny\", starring Listowel's Jared Keeso, has a launch date |last=Adams |first=Blair |work=570 News |date=November 9, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> The show has its roots in ''Letterkenny Problems'', a short-format [[web series]] created by Keeso and released on [[YouTube]] in 2013.<ref name=\"globe_refreshing\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-letterkennys-a-refreshing-and-intoxicating-canadian-comedy/article28653500/ |title=John Doyle: Letterkenny's a refreshing and intoxicating Canadian comedy |last=Doyle |first=John |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 8, 2016 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> ''Letterkenny Problems'' garnered a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for Best Original Fiction Program or Series Created for Digital Media at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2014.<ref name=\"wfp\" /> The town of Letterkenny portrayed in the series is fictional, and not based on the [[Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan|actual ghost town]] in [[Renfrew County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Letterkenny+is+coming+to+CraveTV+and+we+couldn%27t+be+more+excited&id=568936 |title=Letterkenny is coming to CraveTV and we couldn't be more excited |work=TSN |date=December 26, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTierney and [[Michael Dowse]] are also involved in the production of the series.<ref name=\"ctv\" /> Tierney also has a supporting role as Pastor Glen in the series, whose cast also includes [[Michelle Mylett]], Dylan Playfair, Andrew Herr, [[Tyler Johnston]], [[Lisa Codrington]], Alexander De Jordy, [[Kaniehtiio Horn]] and [[K.

\"Not since ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' launched have we heard the flavourful, [[Profanity|salty]] Canadian vernacular used with such aplomb and abandon\"; but also that \"Almost all the conversations

These are their problems.\" The series focuses on siblings Wayne and Katy,{{efn|Katy was created for the TV series, though she was obliquely referenced in an unnamed capacity in the web series.}} who run a small farm and produce stand with help from Wayne's friends Daryl and Squirrely Dan.{{efn|Daryl and Squirrely Dan were both created for the TV series.}} It also focuses on ice hockey players Reilly and Jonesy, two best friends who are involved in an [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-and-off]] [[polyamorous]] relationship with Katy. Episodes deal with small-town life amongst different types of people: the farmers (the \"hicks\"), the out-of-towners who make up the local ice hockey team, the town's [[closeted]] minister, the drug addicts (the \"skids\"), members of the nearby [[First Nations|First Nation]] reserve (the \"natives\"), and the local [[Mennonites]]. Plots often revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as \"the toughest guy in Letterkenny\", the exploits of the town's hockey team who rarely win, Wayne's attempts to break up Katy's relationships with various men he dislikes, the skids' schemes to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the natives, and Wayne's dating life after dumping his high school sweetheart who cheated on him. In an effort to subvert the usual [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] of small-town residents having lower intelligence levels, one of the show's running jokes is that almost every character possesses the ability to think quickly and come up with a near-constant barrage of wordplay and puns.\n\n==Production==\n''Letterkenny'' is the first original series commissioned by [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]],<ref name=\"wfp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/TV/Crave-TV-orders-up-first-original-series-Letterkenny-295212911.html |title=Crave TV orders up first original series: Letterkenny |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=March 5, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> and premiered on that platform on February 7, 2016.<ref name=\"570 News\">{{cite web |url=https://www.570news.com/2015/11/09/tv-show-letterkenny-staring-listowels-jared-keeso-has-a-launch-date/ |title=TV Show \"Letterkenny\", starring Listowel's Jared Keeso, has a launch date |last=Adams |first=Blair |work=570 News |date=November 9, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> The show has its roots in ''Letterkenny Problems'', a short-format [[web series]] created by Keeso and released on [[YouTube]] in 2013.<ref name=\"globe_refreshing\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-letterkennys-a-refreshing-and-intoxicating-canadian-comedy/article28653500/ |title=John Doyle: Letterkenny's a refreshing and intoxicating Canadian comedy |last=Doyle |first=John |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 8, 2016 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> ''Letterkenny Problems'' garnered a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for Best Original Fiction Program or Series Created for Digital Media at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2014.<ref name=\"wfp\" /> The town of Letterkenny portrayed in the series is fictional, and not based on the [[Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan|actual ghost town]] in [[Renfrew County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Letterkenny+is+coming+to+CraveTV+and+we+couldn%27t+be+more+excited&id=568936 |title=Letterkenny is coming to CraveTV and we couldn't be more excited |work=TSN |date=December 26, 2015 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTierney and [[Michael Dowse]] are also involved in the production of the series.<ref name=\"ctv\" /> Tierney also has a supporting role as Pastor Glen in the series, whose cast also includes [[Michelle Mylett]], Dylan Playfair, Andrew Herr, [[Tyler Johnston]], [[Lisa Codrington]], Alexander De Jordy, [[Kaniehtiio Horn]] and [[K.

{"title_page": "Neurohacking", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Neurohacking''' is the colloquial term for (usually personal or '[[DIY]]') [[neuroengineering]]. It is a form of [[Grinder (biohacking)|biohacking]] (qv) focusing on the brain and [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. Strictly speaking it is any method of manipulating or interfering with the structure and/or function of neurons for improvement or repair.\n\n== Reasons ==\n\n=== Mental health ===\n\nThe main goal of neurohacking is optimal mental health.  Other goals include damage repair, [[simulated reality]], prevention of disease and augmentation of abilities or of intelligence overall. It utilises information and technology mainly from the fields of [[epigenetics]], bio/neurofeedback, [[psychopharmacology]], biological psychology and functional analysis, but many practitioners also employ physical exercise, nutritional guidelines, vitamins & supplements, meditation and/or self-hypnosis. Some avoid all neuroactive substances including caffeine, alcohol, food additives and fast-release sugars.\nCurrent research focus on the nature and development of intelligence and how to increase or improve it. The works of Dr. Herman Epstein, Joseph LeDoux, Alex Ramonsky, Frederick Starr/Sean and David Barker are influential. The ethical basis of Neurohacking for health is that it should be practiced strictly with informed consent.\n\n=== Human enhancement ===\n\nThere are numerous examples of the use of neural implants for therapy, however the only experiments involving hacking into the nervous system for enhancement appear to be those conducted by [[Kevin Warwick]]. In a series of experiments at the [[University of Reading]], Warwick became the first human recipient of a [[BrainGate]] electrode array implant on 14 March 2002, into the [[median nerve]] of his left arm. With this in place he was able to control a [[robot arm]] to copy his own hand movements.<ref>Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:\u201cThe Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems\u201d, ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003</ref> Warwick's nervous system was also connected with the internet in [[Columbia University]], New York to enable him to control the [[robot arm]] in the University of Reading, also receiving feedback from sensors in the finger tips. A simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife. With this in place they were able to achieve the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy|journal= IEE Proceedings - Communications|volume=151|issue=3|pages=185|doi=10.1049/ip-com:20040409|year=2004|last1=Warwick|first1=K.|last2=Gasson|first2=M.|last3=Hutt|first3=B.|last4=Goodhew|first4=I.|last5=Kyberd|first5=P.|last6=Schulzrinne|first6=H.|last7=Wu|first7=X.}}</ref> \n\n=== Information retrieval ===\n\nThe term neurohacking is also used for a method of attempting to retrieve information from the [[brain]] (such as passwords, locations, etc..) without consent; presently no technology exists for such a tactic. The concept has been used much in science fiction (e.g. the film \"[[The Matrix]]\"). In data retrieval, some sort of [[brain\u2013computer interface]] (BCI) is typically used, where the brains [[neuron]] [[synapses]] are somehow captured or recorded to be processed for information. Promoters of this concept generally refer to the MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) or MEG ([[magnetoencephalography]]) to support the plausibility of this concept. Although some sort of [[neuroimaging]] could someday be used, the accuracy of any present day method is not nearly close enough. For instance, it is assumed that neurohacking requires detection of the state of individual neurons (approximately 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]] diameter) while the resolution of the MEG is several thousand neurons and other imaging systems may be even larger. It is estimated that usable neurohacking of this type is still many decades away.\n\n== '''Applications''' ==\n\n==== '''Mental Health''' ====\nBettering people\u2019s mental health is one primary application of neurohacking.\n\nVirtual reality exposure therapy is one application of neurohacking, and is being used to treat post traumatic stress. The USC Institute for Creative Technologies has been working on exposure therapy techniques since 2005, and exposure therapy is now an evidence based treatment for post traumatic stress <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/pts/|title=Bravemind: Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy|last=Rizzo|first=Albert|date=March, 2016|website=USC Institute for Creative Technologies|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3/4/2020}}</ref>. \n\nExposure therapy retrains the mind of the patient to reduce the fear associated with feeling a certain way or experiencing certain triggering stimuli. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188445/]. By confronting situations in a safe and controlled virtual reality environment, the patient is able to reduce the anxiety associated with those circumstances.\n\nThe FDA has approved DBS devices for the treatment of both Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Dystonia[https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/vercise-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-system-p150031]. There are several risks involved with this treatment, such as depression, hypo-mania, euphoria, mirth, and hypersexuality. However, permanent complications are rare[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0891988704267466]. DBS has also been used to Tourette Syndrome[https://web.archive.org/web/20051122154536/http://tsa-usa.org/news/DBS-Statement.html], dyskinesia[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mds.20896] eppilepsy[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00501.x] and depression[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023999/], although more research is needed in these areas before it can be deemed safe.\n\n==== '''Human Enhancement''' ====\nEnhancing the human experience is another application of neurohacking. Methods include simple brain-training games, chemical enhancers, and electrical brain stimulation.\n\nCaffeine is an effective method for enhancing human performance in everyday life. Caffeine is the most popular drug in the world (humans drink a collective 1.6 billion cups per day) and is also the most popular method by which people are neurohacking[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462044/]. Caffeine improves memory, sociability, and alertness[https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-why-caffeine-makes-you-productive-2014-5].\n\nAnother chemical performance enhancer, dihexa, is an ingestable neuropeptide that was approved for use in the United States in 2019. It is prescribed to clients who want to achieve a specific goal such as learn a new language or master an instrument[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/11/02/neurohacking-cream-helps-learn-guitar-faster-available-five/].\n\n==== '''Information Retrieval''' ====\nThe third primary application of neurohacking is information retrieval from the brain. This typically involves the use of a brain-machine interface (BMI) \u2013 an apparatus to measure electrical signals in the brain[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00584/full].\n\nIn 2016, researchers modeled an individual\u2019s interest in digital content by monitoring their EEG (electroencephalogram). The researchers asked the user to read Wikipedia articles. From data in the EEG, they could predict which article the user would want to read next based on the individual\u2019s expressed interest in each topic. The researchers claim this paradigm can be used to \u201crecommend information without any explicit user interaction\u201d[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143956/].\n\nIn July 2019, Neuralink \u2013 a company developing implantable brain-machine interfaces \u2013 presented their research on their high bandwidth BMI. Neuralink claims to have developed an implantable BMI device that is capable of recording and delivering full bandwidth data from the brain. The company hopes to use this technology to create a high-speed connection between the brain and digital technology, bypassing the need to type search queries or read the results[https://www.techbrackets.com/elon-musk-neuralink-merge-human-brain-ai/].\n\n== '''Legal and Ethical Aspects''' ==\n\n==== '''Advertisement of Brain-training Software''' ====\nThe neurohacking trend has been heavily commercialized, with companies such as Lumosity and CogniFit marketing games that allegedly optimize the performances of the brain as well as alleviate the symptoms of senescence-related cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have called into question the effectiveness of these softwares [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=27325761]. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed claims against some companies producing brain training software for misleading marketing[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges]. Claims against Lumosity for misleading advertisement are over $2 million[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges]. Conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of brain training software has yet to be presented. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0967-4][https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7470]. Despite this uncertainty, the public demand for such products is rising. Sales in 2015 reached $67 million in the United States and Canada[https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/02/10/lumosity-other-brain-training-products-get-federal-scrutiny.html].\n\n'''Unfair Advantages'''\n\nNo governing organizations responsible for overseeing athletics and education have policies regulating neurohacking. Athletes and students can use neurohacking to gain an unfair advantage in sporting events and academic settings[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Studies have indicated that neurohacking can improve memory, creativity, learning speed, muscle gain, and athletic performance[https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/Directors-Message/Directors-Messages/Noninvasive-Brain-Stimulation-Applications-and-Implications]. However, there are no well-developed tests or instruments capable of detecting neurohacking. Students and athletes may utilize neurohacking techniques and never be detected[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Side Effects and Unknown Dangers'''\n\nMost manufacturers fail to disclose the potential side effects of neurohacking devices, including significant changes to the user\u2019s self-identity and decreased reasoning skills[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00281/full][https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Affordable neurohacking devices are available online with prices ranging from $99 to $800, making them easily accessible to consumers. For instance, a \u201cbrain stimulator\u201d device produced by the \u201cBrain Stimulator\u201d company that utilizes tDCS is priced $127 to $179[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331/]. However, these devices are rarely regulated by the government[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/12/sxsw-neuroscientists-home-hacking-your-brain-with-electronics].Using these unapproved devices with no medical supervision could cause devastating side effects [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331]. Cases have been cited where individuals physically harm others as a side effect of neurohacking[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Insurance Claims'''\n\nThe Vercise DBS System produced by Boston Scientific Corporation is the only neurohacking medical device for sale that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and Good Practices in Clinical Research[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880][https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/vercise-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-system-p150031]. With the rise of DIY neurohacking, many individuals self-treat without proper supervision by a medical professional. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880]. Insurance companies deny medical insurance compensation for users who are injured using unapproved medical-grade neurohacking devices[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Most neurohacking devices are uncertified and unregulated[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Grinder (biohacking community)|Biohacking]]\n* [[Psychonautics]]\n* [[Wetware (brain)]]\n* [[Neuroenhancement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{Reflist|}}\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=27325761\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.neurohackers.com/ ''The Neurohackers Association'']\n* [https://www.neurohacking.xyz/ ''Neurohacking.xyz'']\n* [http://www.neurohackers.com/index.php/en/menu-left-workshop/75-cat-ws-icmm ''I've Changed My Mind'' by Alex Ramonsky]\n* [http://www.cyberpunks.org/freeside/mab_cyber.html ''Cyberware Technology'' by Taryn East] \n* [http://www.wetwarehacker.com/ ''Wetware Technology'']\n* [http://lifehacker.com/5585217/what-caffeine-actually-does-to-your-brain/ ''Life Hacker'']\n\n\n{{BCI}}\n\n[[Category:Neurotechnology]]\n[[Category:Science fiction themes]]\n[[Category:Devices to alter consciousness]]\n[[Category:Do it yourself]]\n[[Category:Transhumanism]]\n\n[[fr:Neuro-ing\u00e9nierie]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Neurohacking''' is the colloquial term for (usually personal or '[[DIY]]') [[neuroengineering]].

However, there are no well-developed tests or instruments capable of detecting neurohacking. Students and athletes may utilize neurohacking techniques and never be detected[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Side Effects and Unknown Dangers'''\n\nMost manufacturers fail to disclose the potential side effects of neurohacking devices, including significant changes to the user\u2019s self-identity and decreased reasoning skills[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00281/full][https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Affordable neurohacking devices are available online with prices ranging from $99 to $800, making them easily accessible to consumers. For instance, a \u201cbrain stimulator\u201d device produced by the \u201cBrain Stimulator\u201d company that utilizes tDCS is priced $127 to $179[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331/]. However, these devices are rarely regulated by the government[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/12/sxsw-neuroscientists-home-hacking-your-brain-with-electronics].Using these unapproved devices with no medical supervision could cause devastating side effects [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331]. Cases have been cited where individuals physically harm others as a side effect of neurohacking[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Insurance Claims'''\n\nThe Vercise DBS System produced by Boston Scientific Corporation is the only neurohacking medical device for sale that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and Good Practices in Clinical Research[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880][https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/vercise-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-system-p150031]. With the rise of DIY neurohacking, many individuals self-treat without proper supervision by a medical professional. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880]. Insurance companies deny medical insurance compensation for users who are injured using unapproved medical-grade neurohacking devices[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Most neurohacking devices are uncertified and unregulated[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Grinder (biohacking community)|Biohacking]]\n* [[Psychonautics]]\n* [[Wetware (brain)]]\n* [[Neuroenhancement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{Reflist|}}\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=27325761\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.neurohackers.com/ ''The Neurohackers Association'']\n* [https://www.neurohacking.xyz/ ''Neurohacking.xyz'']\n* [http://www.neurohackers.com/index.php/en/menu-left-workshop/75-cat-ws-icmm ''I've Changed My Mind'' by Alex Ramonsky]\n* [http://www.cyberpunks.org/freeside/mab_cyber.html ''Cyberware Technology'' by Taryn East] \n* [http://www.wetwarehacker.com/ ''Wetware Technology'']\n* [http://lifehacker.com/5585217/what-caffeine-actually-does-to-your-brain/ ''Life Hacker'']\n\n\n{{BCI}}\n\n[[Category:Neurotechnology]]\n[[Category:Science fiction themes]]\n[[Category:Devices to alter consciousness]]\n[[Category:Do it yourself]]\n[[Category:Transhumanism]]\n\n[[fr:Neuro-ing\u00e9nierie]]\n", "name_user": "SophiaMB", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed link to citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurohacking"}
