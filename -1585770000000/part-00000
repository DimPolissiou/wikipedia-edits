However, Tracy drugs the much older [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) and pretends that she has had sex with him, leading him to believe he is the father. Tracy offers to sell her baby to Roy and his wife, [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), and they accept. Roy marries Tracy to ensure he would be named the baby's carer. Tracy gives birth to a daughter in February 2004 and she is called Patience by Roy and Hayley. Tracy later changes her mind and demands her daughter back during Steve's wedding, admitting that he is the father. Roy and Hayley hand her back and Tracy renames her Amy. Steve's wife, [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), resents Amy's presence, even causing a fight at her christening. In December 2004, Karen later steals Tracy's car, unaware Amy is in the back. She burns the car, making Tracy believe that Amy is still in it when she is actually safe. \n\nIn January 2007, Tracy murders [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) and is subsequently imprisoned. Amy moves in with Steve and his mother [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) at [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].

In May 2010, when Amy is bullied about Tracy, Becky tells her about Tracy being in prison and they later visit her. Tracy's grandmother [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) dies in the same month. Becky looks after a confused and upset six-year-old Amy and she ties a picture to a balloon for Blanche. Tracy attends Blanche's funeral and is reunited with Amy, who is initially frightened of her. On Christmas Day 2010, Amy is upset further when Tracy attacks Becky. Tracy is freed and visits Amy, who tells her about Steve and Becky buying [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] (Harry McDermott). Amy moves in with Tracy at the Barlow house. In early 2011, Amy goes to [[Blackpool]] with Steve and Tracy. When she becomes fed up with them arguing, she runs off. Amy is eventually found and the family spend the night in Blackpool, after Steve's car is towed away. Amy is diagnosed with a dairy allergy after she ends up in hospital. Amy starts deliberately making herself ill, so Steve will come and look after her with Tracy. Tracy and Steve are mortified when Amy admits she has been drinking milk on purpose in a bid for more attention. In the summer of 2011, Steve leaves Amy with Tracy's adoptive nephew [[James Cunningham (Coronation Street)|James Cunningham]] ([[James Roache]]), when he has a work problem to deal with. James asks Amy to go upstairs, but she overhears his conversation with a surveyor. James threatens to put Tracy in prison if Amy tells anyone. A few days later, Amy tells Tracy and James insists she is making the story up. Tracy and Amy then leave for London for a few weeks.\n\nOn their return in August 2011, Tracy announces she is pregnant and she and Steve start a proper relationship. Amy is excited to have two new siblings and Steve and Tracy back together. In December 2011, Amy acts in the local nativity play and she asks to visit Becky, following a fire at her flat on Christmas Day 2011. In January 2012, Amy is a bridesmaid at Tracy and Steve's wedding, but Steve and Tracy split up shortly afterwards. Steve divides the house in two, with Amy living upstairs with Tracy. When Steve cuts the electricity, Tracy asks her parents [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]) and [[Deirdre Barlow]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) to look after Amy. Steve later removes the partition and moves out, leaving Amy and Tracy to live with [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and her son, [[Craig Tinker]] (Colson Smith). [[Lesley Kershaw]] ([[Judy Holt]]) takes Amy to the park. Steve catches up with them and brings Amy home to a worried Tracy. In June 2012, Amy notices her pocket money has gone missing from her piggy bank, but Tracy does not believe her. It later transpires that Amy's adoptive cousin [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) stole it along with [[Aadi Alahan]]'s (Zennon Ditchett) game console. Tracy and Amy are left homeless when Steve decides to sell number 13, but they eventually move in with [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) and [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]). However, they are kicked out again when Tracy ruins Norris' shoes unaware that they were actually Emily's late husband [[Ernest Bishop]]'s ([[Stephen Hancock]]). Ken refuses to take Tracy in however makes Amy as an exception, but Tracy refuses to separate from Amy. Tracy complains of stomach pains but everyone refuses to believe her knowing her manipulative personality. However Ken, Deirdre and Amy later find her on the floor collapsed and is rushed to hospital. Tracy tells Amy that she and Steve are reuniting, but witnesses Steve kissing his ex-girlfriend [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]). Upset and confused, she tells Deirdre. Amy eventually bonds with Michelle and accepts her and Steve's relationship. When Tracy begins a relationship with [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]), she starts bunking off to stay at his flat. Ken and Deirdre accuse Tracy of neglect and Amy goes to live with Steve, Michelle and Michelle's adoptive son [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]) in their small 2 bedroom flat and Amy has to sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge. However, when [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) puts The Rovers up for sale, Steve buys it back from her and Ryan goes to live in [[Ibiza]]. Liz returns as landlady of The Rovers and she also lives there. Amy stays with Ken, Deirdre and Tracy twice a week, but Tracy usually stays at Rob's flat for the rest of the time.\n\nBy the time Amy turns 10, it is clear that she has inherited troublemaking traits from her mother. This starts when Amy taunts Simon when his father [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) is sent to prison for the murder of [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Whilst being looked after by [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) and her girlfriend, [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]), Amy becomes jealous of the amount of attention that Simon is getting. After Maddie berates Amy for bullying Simon, Amy sneaks off to see Tracy and lies that Maddie has threatened to hit her. A week later, Simon and Amy are once again looked after by Maddie and Sophie and again, Amy is jealous of the attention that Maddie shows to Simon. When they stop at ''The Kabin'' to get some sweets, Amy deliberately lets Deirdre's dog, Eccles, off her lead, knowing that the dog going missing would greatly upset Simon. Later, Sophie and Maddie find the dog and return her home to a relieved Deirdre and Simon. In September 2014, Amy causes more trouble when she cuts her hand on the back door and lies that the dog has bitten her. Tracy is furious and insists that the dog must be put down. Simon is devastated and tells Sophie and Maddie about what has happened. Maddie and a reluctant Sophie agree to try to help and they take the dog and hide her in No. 4. The Barlows begin searching for the dog and a couple of days later, Ken spots Sophie and Maddie taking her for a walk. Ken brings the dog home and Tracy again insists that the dog has to go. Ken tries to get Amy to tell the truth about her injury and she eventually reveals that she lied about the dog biting her. Maddie praises Amy for telling the truth, telling her that she was very brave.\n\nIn May 2015, Amy, along with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), becomes trapped in a fire in the Victoria Court flats after it was accidentally started by Tracy. Carla is rescued while Leanne and her partner, [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]) enter the flat to save Amy, but Kal, Leanne and Amy all become trapped when the roof caves in and blocks the door. Luckily, the fire brigade arrive and manage to get Leanne and Amy out of the flat, but an explosion happens, killing Kal. However, Amy does not seem to take Kal's death seriously and feels happier that she was rescued from the fire. In July 2015, Amy is upset to learn that Deirdre died just before she was due to return to Weatherfield. Simon and Amy are both left money by Deirdre in her will. In September 2015, Amy starts at Weatherfield High School and she also decides to take up violin lessons. In November 2015, Simon moves in with the Barlows because he has been physically abusing his adoptive mother, [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). Amy annoys Simon with her violin, he tries to take the violin from Amy, however Ken catches them arguing and they come up with a solution. Simon and Amy are left alone at the Barlow house and Simon ends up hurting Amy. Amy tells Ken and Tracy, who contact Leanne, who is encouraged by her half-sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) to admit Simon has been hurting her. Leanne has to take Simon home and the family agree to get Simon help.\n\nAt Carla and [[Nick Tilsley]]'s ([[Ben Price]]) wedding in May 2016, Tracy reveals Carla's lies to everyone and following her boyfriend [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]) splitting from Tracy, Amy decides to move in with Steve and Michelle. Amy refuses to move back in with Tracy, despite persuasion from Steve and Michelle. When Amy meets Michelle's ex-boyfriend [[Will Chatterton]] ([[Leon Ockenden]]) and overhears a conversation between Michelle and [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]), she realises Michelle and Will had a fling and blackmails Michelle into allowing her to stay. Amy bans Tracy from her violin recital, but Tracy turns up and it puts Amy off. Tracy is taken to hospital when she collapses due to her kidney and Amy refuses to see her. Tracy is soon discharged and at Simon's birthday tea in July 2016, Amy is annoyed with Tracy when she turns up with gifts for her. On the anniversary of Deirdre's death, Amy overhears Ken and Rita tell funny stories about Deirdre. Amy believes it is rude, but Robert explains they were remembering her and they go to the graveyard to support Tracy. Amy insists nothing has changed between them, but Steve and Ken persuade Amy to move back in with Tracy. Simon confides in Amy about his fears that Leanne has cancer and Amy tries to reassure him, but he finds a message on Leanne's phone confirming a doctor's appointment.\n\nIn September 2016, Liz lets slip that Michelle is pregnant after Amy complains about Michelle snapping at her and Amy is delighted. In October 2016, Amy finds Michelle is researching abortion clinics and Michelle explains to her the baby may be ill, but Amy refuses to accept it. Amy and Michelle make amends and Michelle decides not to have an abortion. In January 2017, Michelle suffers a [[Miscarriage|late miscarriage]] and hers and Steve's son, [[Ruairi McDonald]], dies at birth. In February 2017, when Amy returns from a school trip, Steve tells her that he and Michelle have split up as Leanne's son, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2017)#Oliver Battersby|Oliver Battersby]], is his son. In March 2017, Tracy and Amy believe Ken does not love them as much compared to the Barlow family. Amy smashes a violin from a skip, pretending it is hers, and gets the money from Ken for a replacement, but she later calls someone and leaves the money for the violin at the house. When Ken is found unconscious at the bottom of the stairs (see [[Who Attacked Ken?]]), the police believe he was pushed and the family are made suspects and Amy secretly has been in contact with Ken's grandson, [[Adam Barlow]] ([[Sam Robertson]]), who was supposedly in Canada. In April 2017, when Adam suspects Tracy attacked Ken, he tries to get information from Amy, but she refuses to say anything against Tracy and Amy phones the police, telling them that Adam's alibi was false.

On the anniversary of Deirdre's death, Amy overhears Ken and Rita tell funny stories about Deirdre. Amy believes it is rude, but Robert explains they were remembering her and they go to the graveyard to support Tracy. Amy insists nothing has changed between them, but Steve and Ken persuade Amy to move back in with Tracy. Simon confides in Amy about his fears that Leanne has cancer and Amy tries to reassure him, but he finds a message on Leanne's phone confirming a doctor's appointment.\n\nIn September 2016, Liz lets slip that Michelle is pregnant after Amy complains about Michelle snapping at her and Amy is delighted. In October 2016, Amy finds Michelle is researching abortion clinics and Michelle explains to her the baby may be ill, but Amy refuses to accept it. Amy and Michelle make amends and Michelle decides not to have an abortion. In January 2017, Michelle suffers a [[Miscarriage|late miscarriage]] and hers and Steve's son, [[Ruairi McDonald]], dies at birth. In February 2017, when Amy returns from a school trip, Steve tells her that he and Michelle have split up as Leanne's son, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2017)#Oliver Battersby|Oliver Battersby]], is his son. In March 2017, Tracy and Amy believe Ken does not love them as much compared to the Barlow family. Amy smashes a violin from a skip, pretending it is hers, and gets the money from Ken for a replacement, but she later calls someone and leaves the money for the violin at the house. When Ken is found unconscious at the bottom of the stairs (see [[Who Attacked Ken?]]), the police believe he was pushed and the family are made suspects and Amy secretly has been in contact with Ken's grandson, [[Adam Barlow]] ([[Sam Robertson]]), who was supposedly in Canada. In April 2017, when Adam suspects Tracy attacked Ken, he tries to get information from Amy, but she refuses to say anything against Tracy and Amy phones the police, telling them that Adam's alibi was false. When Adam is arrested, Amy admits to Tracy that she phoned the police. Amy is question by [[List of Coronation Street characters (2016)#DS MacKinnon|DS MacKinnon]] ([[Sandra Huggett]]) when Adam tells DS MacKinnon about the money, but Amy denies it. In May 2017, Tracy confides in Rob, who escapes from prison whilst being transferred, about her fears that Amy was responsible for Ken's attack. Tracy goes on the run with Amy to the [[Peak District]] along with Rob, although Amy is unaware he is with them and Tracy fails to tell Amy that Rob is with them. The Barlows and the McDonalds find Tracy's and Amy's phones still at home and Amy's passport missing and they report Tracy and Amy's disappearance to DS MacKinnon. Steve and Ken are told by the police about Rob's disappearance and that Tracy and Amy could be involved and choose to just report Tracy and Amy's disappearance in the news. Amy phones Steve, which the police use to find their whereabouts and when she returns, she finds Tracy and Rob kissing and they explain how Rob escaped and Amy tells them about phoning Steve. When the police arrive, Rob takes Amy back to Weatherfield and Tracy tells the police she attacked Ken. Amy finds out from Rob that Tracy confessed to the police, covering for her, but Amy denies hurting Ken and when Tracy is in court, Rob bursts in and tells Tracy that Amy is innocent.\n\nWhen [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) and his boyfriend [[Billy Mayhew]] ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]) become guardians of Billy's goddaughter, [[Summer Spellman]] (Matilda Freeman), Tracy brings Amy to meet Summer. Amy and Summer do not interact and in Billy and Todd's absence, they argue and Amy accuses Summer of hitting her. When Amy and Summer have their hair done for school and are not allowed highlights, Summer uses bleach and other products to do so for Amy and [[Asha Alahan]] (Tanisha Gorey). Amy's hair turns orange and Todd, Amy and Summer lie to Tracy that Amy wants a sleepover with Summer for a chance to fix it, but Tracy finds out about the hair. In September 2017, Amy and Asha put blue paint on the window wipers of Roy's car, angering [[Cathy Matthews]] ([[Melanie Hill]]) and [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]]), who make Amy and Asha put on a [[Boney M]] tribute act for their punishment. Wanting to be friends with Amy and Asha, Summer uses shaving foam to draw an inappropriate image on a teacher's car, but is caught, which results in Billy and Todd being called in. Simon attempts to force Summer to smoke cigarettes he found, but Summer takes them for herself and smokes them when she is emotional. Summer is found unconscious by Simon and Amy and is taken to hospital, where it turns out she smoked spice and Billy and Todd make amends. Peter and his partner, [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), find out from Simon, Amy, Aadi and Asha that Simon had the cigarette. Amy is not happy when Steve and Tracy get back together. After lying about her whereabouts, Steve and Tracy turn up at one of Amy's friends party, where Amy is caught kissing a boy. Amy helps Summer to look for Billy, but are put in danger when a homeless man tricks them into knowing his whereabouts, but Peter gets them away.\n\nBy the age of 14 years old, Amy discovers she is pregnant and when she tells her parents, Steve reacts negatively and accuses Aadi and Simon of impregnating her. Tracy demands Amy to reveal the identity of her baby's father, but Amy claims she does not know who he is as she had met him at a Christmas party and that it was her first time having sex. Amy considers having an abortion but changes her mind shortly after talking to teenage mother [[Faye Windass]] ([[Ellie Leach]]). Amy then later meets with Simon's enemy [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Tyler Jefferies|Tyler Jefferies]] (Will Barnett) to discuss their one night stand and her pregnancy, revealing him to be the father. Upon realising Amy is underage, Tyler rejects Amy and threatens her to have an abortion. Tracy and Steve later learn the truth of the paternity and tells Amy that they have decided to adopt her baby and raise it as their own child. When Tyler firmly tells Amy that he doesn't want to be a father and overwhelmed with Tracy and Steve's excitement of adopting the baby, Amy secretly has an abortion with [[Bethany Platt]] ([[Lucy Fallon]]) by her side at the clinic. Tracy learns of Amy's secret and admits to the realisation that she has neglected Amy's emotional feelings over the baby.\n\n==Casting==\nHolly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike shared the role of newborn Amy Barlow in February 2004 for a month until Bowyer left.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/meet-corries-tug-of-love-baby-1101282|work=Manchester Evening News|title=Meet Corrie's tug of love baby|date=13 August 2004|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Pike continued in the role until July 2005 when she was replaced with Louisa Morris.<ref name=\"Amy Barlow actress replaced\">{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/coronation-street/news/amy-barlow-actress-replaced-in-coronation-street|work=What's On TV|title=Amy Barlow actress replaced in Coronation Street|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Morris departed two months later and the role was briefly taken over by twins Rachel and Sarah Corker for two episodes in September.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Television%3A+Kat+is+over+the+Moon+to+be+Alfie's+chosen+one.-a0135790887|work=Sunday Mail|title=Television: Kat is over the Moon to be Alfie's chosen one.|date=4 September 2005|accessdate=13 October 2016}}</ref> Amy was once again recast later that month with Madison Hampson.<ref name=\"Amy Barlow actress replaced\"/>\n\nHampson quit ''Coronation Street'' in  early 2006.

Several seminal works stimulating muscle contractions using [[Leyden jar]]s culminated with the publication of classical studies by [[Luigi Galvani]] in 1791 (De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari) and 1794. In these, Galvani thought to have uncovered intrinsic electric-producing ability in living tissues or \u201canimal electricity\u201d. [[Alessandro Volta]] showed that the frog's leg muscle twitching was due to a static electricity generator and from dissimilar [[metal]]s contact. Galvani showed, in a 1794 study, twitching without metal electricity by touching the leg muscle with a deviating cut [[sciatic nerve]], definitively showing \u201canimal electricity\u201d. Unknowingly, Galvani with this and related experiments discovered the injury current (ion leakage driven by the intact membrane/epithelial potential) and injury potential (potential difference between injured and intact membrane/epithelium). The injury potential was, in fact, the electrical source behind the leg contraction, as realized in the next century.<ref>Maden, M. A history of regeneration research.

Pubmed Central reference number: PMC1331188</ref> Breaking the epithelial barrier, as occurs in any wounds, creates a hole that breaches the high electrical resistance established by the tight junctions in the epithelial sheet, short-circuiting the epithelium locally. The TEP therefore drops to zero at the wound. However, normal ion transport continues in unwounded epithelial cells beyond the wound edge (typically <1&nbsp;mm away), driving positive charge flow out of the wound and establishing a steady, laterally-oriented electric field (EF) with the cathode at the wound. Skin also generates a TEP, and when a skin wound is made, similar wound electric currents and fields arise, until the epithelial barrier function recovers to terminate the short-circuit at the wound. When wound electric fields are manipulated with pharmacological agents that either stimulate or inhibit transport of ions, the wound electric fields also increase or decrease, respectively. Wound healing can be speed up or slowed down accordingly in cornea wounds.<ref name=pmid15746181/><ref name=pmid16871217/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jcs.01341 |pmid=15371524 |title=Nerve regeneration and wound healing are stimulated and directed by an endogenous electrical field in vivo |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=117 |issue=20 |pages=4681\u201390 |year=2004 |last1=Song |first1=B }}</ref>\n\nHow do electric fields affect wound healing? To heal wounds, cells surrounding the wound must migrate and grow directionally into the wound to cover the defect and restore the barrier. Cells important to heal wounds respond remarkably well to applied electric fields of the same strength that are measured at wounds. The whole gamut of cell types and their responses following injury are affected by physiological electric fields. Those include migration and division of epithelial cells, sprouting and extension of nerves, and migration of leukocytes and endothelial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2465 |pmid=18684937 |pmc=2572691 |title=Lymphocyte Electrotaxis in Vitro and in Vivo |journal=The Journal of Immunology |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=2465\u201371 |year=2008 |last1=Lin |first1=F |last2=Baldessari |first2=F |last3=Gyenge |first3=C.

Several seminal works stimulating muscle contractions using [[Leyden jar]]s culminated with the publication of classical studies by [[Luigi Galvani]] in 1791 (De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari) and 1794. In these, Galvani thought to have uncovered intrinsic electric-producing ability in living tissues or \u201canimal electricity\u201d. [[Alessandro Volta]] showed that the frog's leg muscle twitching was due to a static electricity generator and from dissimilar [[metal]]s contact. Galvani showed, in a 1794 study, twitching without metal electricity by touching the leg muscle with a deviating cut [[sciatic nerve]], definitively showing \u201canimal electricity\u201d. Unknowingly, Galvani with this and related experiments discovered the injury current (ion leakage driven by the intact membrane/epithelial potential) and injury potential (potential difference between injured and intact membrane/epithelium). The injury potential was, in fact, the electrical source behind the leg contraction, as realized in the next century.<ref>Maden, M. A history of regeneration research.

Epithelia actively pump and differentially segregate ions. In the cornea epithelium, for example, Na+ and K+ are transported inwards from tear fluid to extracellular fluid, and Cl\u2212 is transported out of the extracellular fluid into the tear fluid. The epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions, forming the major electrical resistive barrier, and thus establishing an electrical gradient across the epithelium \u2013 the transepithelial potential (TEP).<ref>Maurice, D. M. The permeability to sodium ions of the living rabbit's cornea. J Physiol 112, 367-391. Pubmed Central reference number: PMC1393020</ref><ref>Klyce, S. D. Electrical profiles in the corneal epithelium. J Physiol 226, 407-429. Pubmed Central reference number: PMC1331188</ref> Breaking the epithelial barrier, as occurs in any wounds, creates a hole that breaches the high electrical resistance established by the tight junctions in the epithelial sheet, short-circuiting the epithelium locally. The TEP therefore drops to zero at the wound. However, normal ion transport continues in unwounded epithelial cells beyond the wound edge (typically <1&nbsp;mm away), driving positive charge flow out of the wound and establishing a steady, laterally-oriented electric field (EF) with the cathode at the wound. Skin also generates a TEP, and when a skin wound is made, similar wound electric currents and fields arise, until the epithelial barrier function recovers to terminate the short-circuit at the wound. When wound electric fields are manipulated with pharmacological agents that either stimulate or inhibit transport of ions, the wound electric fields also increase or decrease, respectively. Wound healing can be speed up or slowed down accordingly in cornea wounds.<ref name=pmid15746181/><ref name=pmid16871217/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jcs.01341 |pmid=15371524 |title=Nerve regeneration and wound healing are stimulated and directed by an endogenous electrical field in vivo |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=117 |issue=20 |pages=4681\u201390 |year=2004 |last1=Song |first1=B }}</ref>\n\nHow do electric fields affect wound healing? To heal wounds, cells surrounding the wound must migrate and grow directionally into the wound to cover the defect and restore the barrier. Cells important to heal wounds respond remarkably well to applied electric fields of the same strength that are measured at wounds. The whole gamut of cell types and their responses following injury are affected by physiological electric fields. Those include migration and division of epithelial cells, sprouting and extension of nerves, and migration of leukocytes and endothelial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2465 |pmid=18684937 |pmc=2572691 |title=Lymphocyte Electrotaxis in Vitro and in Vivo |journal=The Journal of Immunology |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=2465\u201371 |year=2008 |last1=Lin |first1=F |last2=Baldessari |first2=F |last3=Gyenge |first3=C.

It is north of [[Croydon]] and is synonymous with the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] area.\n\nUpper Norwood is situated along the [[London clay]] ridge known as Beulah Hill. Most housing dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with large detached properties along the ridge and smaller, semi-detached and terraced dwellings on the slopes. There are some more modern areas of [[social housing]] that date from the 1970s. The hill offers panoramic views northward to central London and southward to central [[Croydon]] and the [[North Downs]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hermitage Road London SE19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hermitage Road, a Victorian suburban street in Upper Norwood]][[File:Central Hill Upper Norwood.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A misty day on Central Hill, Upper Norwood. To the right of the line of parked cars is the chapel of [[Virgo Fidelis Convent Senior School|Virgo Fidelis Roman Catholic Girls' School]].]]\nThe area is one of the highest in the London area, and for centuries was occupied by the [[Great North Wood]], an extensive area of natural [[oak]] forest which formed a wilderness close to the southern edge of the ever-expanding city of London. The name \"Norwood\" is a contraction of \"North Wood\". Local legend has it that [[Sir Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake's]] ship, ''[[Golden Hind|The Golden Hind]]'', was made from timber cut from trees in this area. The forest was a popular area for Londoners' recreation until the 19th century, when it began to be built over. It was also a haunt of [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with many local street names and pubs recording the link, notably [[Gipsy Hill]]. The area still retains woodland in large amounts for an urban area.\n\nThe Beulah Hill ridge was used as a sighting-point for the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790)]], which measured the precise distance between the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and the [[Paris Observatory]], using [[trigonometry]]. It was particularly useful for this purpose on account of both its height and its relative proximity to Greenwich.\n\nIn 1831, one of England's most prominent architects, [[Decimus Burton]], designed a spa and pleasure gardens below Beulah Hill and off what is now Spa Hill in a bowl of land on the south facing side of the hill around a spring of [[chalybeate]] water. Burton was responsible for the Beulah Spa Hotel (demolished c. 1935) and the layout of the grounds.<ref>[http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/thechangingfaceofnorwood.shtml The Changing Face Of Norwood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230521/http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/thechangingfaceofnorwood.shtml |date=18 July 2011 }} Norwood Society, 27 February 2008. Accessed April 2011</ref> Its official title was The Royal Beulah Spa and Gardens. It became a popular society venue attracting large crowds to its ''f\u00eates''. One widely publicized event was a \"Grand Scottish Fete\" on 16 September 1834 \"with a tightrope performance by [[Pablo Fanque]],\" the black circus performer who would later dominate the Victorian circus and achieve immortality in [[The Beatles]] song, ''[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/lawns/tlhistory |title=London Borough of Croydon: The Lawns \u2013 The Lawns History |publisher=Croydon.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314165943/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/lawns/tlhistory |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  The spa closed in 1856 soon after the opening nearby of The Crystal Palace.<ref>Alan R.

It was destroyed in a [[The Crystal Palace#Destruction by fire|spectacular fire]] in 1936. The importance of this building led to the area immediately around the Crystal Palace becoming known as [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]].\n\nThe most easterly district of Upper Norwood is now also known as Crystal Palace and is the commercial hub of Upper Norwood known locally as the \"Triangle\". The most westerly district is also known as Crown Point. The central district was once known as [[Norwood New Town]], but this name is now only seen on older maps.\n\nIn March 1966, shortly before the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup tournament]], the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|Jules Rimet trophy]] was stolen from an exhibition at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall Westminster]]. It was found seven days later in Beulah Hill by a dog named \"[[Pickles (dog)|Pickles]]\".

The library holds a Local History Collection of the Upper Norwood district and the Crystal Palace.\n\nA notable park in the area is [[Upper Norwood Recreation Ground]]. Its {{convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on}} site is part of the Harold Road Conservation Area. Its boundary is defined by Chevening Road, Hermitage Road, Eversley Road and Harold Road. One of London's hidden rivers, [[River Effra]] flows under the park and at the Harold Road end a wellhead exists. It was covered in the 1940s. The Upper Norwood Recreation Ground was a location in [[Patrick Keiller]]'s 1983 film, ''Norwood'', and in [[Chris Shepherd]]'s 2010 film ''[[Bad Night for the Blues]]''.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Croydon transmitting station]], a TV transmitter tower, stands on the hill at Upper Norwood and a second larger TV transmitter, the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station]], stands in Crystal Palace Park. Together these make the district a landmark location, visible from any part of the London area.\n\nIn 1985 a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] supermarket opened on Westow Street. In 1990 the exterior of this branch featured in a clip of the television drama series [[Grange Hill]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pwlx2H2Ud8 Grange Hill \u2013 Series 13 \u2013 Episode 12 at 4:20 mins] Accessed 24 August 2014</ref> The store was acquired by [[Morrisons]] in March 2004, who closed it in November 2005.

The former branch line terminus at [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|Crystal Palace High Level railway station]] which opened in 1865 closed in 1954, and the remaining [[Crystal Palace railway station]] is some distance below Upper Norwood, and approached by many steps. However, Crystal Palace Parade remains an important bus interchange and many residents instead use plentiful local bus routes to travel to [[West Norwood railway station|West Norwood]], [[Tulse Hill railway station|Tulse Hill]], [[Streatham railway station|Streatham]], [[West Dulwich railway station|West Dulwich]] or [[Norbury railway station]]s.  The disconnection from the capital's rail/tube network has led to it having lower house prices than other areas possessing scenic views of London.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Robert FitzRoy's Grave.JPG|thumb|Robert FitzRoy's grave]]\n* [[Thomas Attwood (composer)|Thomas Attwood]], pupil of Mozart and organist at St Paul's Cathedral, lived in ''Roselawn'', a large house on Beulah Hill near the junction with Hermitage Road.

It is north of [[Croydon]] and is synonymous with the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] area.\n\nUpper Norwood is situated along the [[London clay]] ridge known as Beulah Hill. Most housing dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with large detached properties along the ridge and smaller, semi-detached and terraced dwellings on the slopes. There are some more modern areas of [[social housing]] that date from the 1970s. The hill offers panoramic views northward to central London and southward to central [[Croydon]] and the [[North Downs]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hermitage Road London SE19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hermitage Road, a Victorian suburban street in Upper Norwood]][[File:Central Hill Upper Norwood.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A misty day on Central Hill, Upper Norwood. To the right of the line of parked cars is the chapel of [[Virgo Fidelis Convent Senior School|Virgo Fidelis Roman Catholic Girls' School]].]]\nThe area is one of the highest in the London area, and for centuries was occupied by the [[Great North Wood]], an extensive area of natural [[oak]] forest which formed a wilderness close to the southern edge of the ever-expanding city of London. The name \"Norwood\" is a contraction of \"North Wood\". Local legend has it that [[Sir Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake's]] ship, ''[[Golden Hind|The Golden Hind]]'', was made from timber cut from trees in this area. The forest was a popular area for Londoners' recreation until the 19th century, when it began to be built over. It was also a haunt of [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with many local street names and pubs recording the link, notably [[Gipsy Hill]]. The area still retains woodland in large amounts for an urban area.\n\nThe Beulah Hill ridge was used as a sighting-point for the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790)]], which measured the precise distance between the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and the [[Paris Observatory]], using [[trigonometry]]. It was particularly useful for this purpose on account of both its height and its relative proximity to Greenwich.\n\nIn 1831, one of England's most prominent architects, [[Decimus Burton]], designed a spa and pleasure gardens below Beulah Hill and off what is now Spa Hill in a bowl of land on the south facing side of the hill around a spring of [[chalybeate]] water. Burton was responsible for the Beulah Spa Hotel (demolished c. 1935) and the layout of the grounds.<ref>[http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/thechangingfaceofnorwood.shtml The Changing Face Of Norwood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230521/http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/review/thechangingfaceofnorwood.shtml |date=18 July 2011 }} Norwood Society, 27 February 2008. Accessed April 2011</ref> Its official title was The Royal Beulah Spa and Gardens. It became a popular society venue attracting large crowds to its ''f\u00eates''. One widely publicized event was a \"Grand Scottish Fete\" on 16 September 1834 \"with a tightrope performance by [[Pablo Fanque]],\" the black circus performer who would later dominate the Victorian circus and achieve immortality in [[The Beatles]] song, ''[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/lawns/tlhistory |title=London Borough of Croydon: The Lawns \u2013 The Lawns History |publisher=Croydon.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314165943/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/lawns/tlhistory |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  The spa closed in 1856 soon after the opening nearby of The Crystal Palace.<ref>Alan R.

It was destroyed in a [[The Crystal Palace#Destruction by fire|spectacular fire]] in 1936. The importance of this building led to the area immediately around the Crystal Palace becoming known as [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]].\n\nThe most easterly district of Upper Norwood is now also known as Crystal Palace and is the commercial hub of Upper Norwood known locally as the \"Triangle\". The most westerly district is also known as Crown Point. The central district was once known as [[Norwood New Town]], but this name is now only seen on older maps.\n\nIn March 1966, shortly before the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup tournament]], the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|Jules Rimet trophy]] was stolen from an exhibition at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall Westminster]]. It was found seven days later in Beulah Hill by a dog named \"[[Pickles (dog)|Pickles]]\".

The library holds a Local History Collection of the Upper Norwood district and the Crystal Palace.\n\nA notable park in the area is [[Upper Norwood Recreation Ground]]. Its {{convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on}} site is part of the Harold Road Conservation Area. Its boundary is defined by Chevening Road, Hermitage Road, Eversley Road and Harold Road. One of London's hidden rivers, [[River Effra]] flows under the park and at the Harold Road end a wellhead exists. It was covered in the 1940s. The Upper Norwood Recreation Ground was a location in [[Patrick Keiller]]'s 1983 film, ''Norwood'', and in [[Chris Shepherd]]'s 2010 film ''[[Bad Night for the Blues]]''.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Croydon transmitting station]], a TV transmitter tower, stands on the hill at Upper Norwood and a second larger TV transmitter, the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station]], stands in Crystal Palace Park. Together these make the district a landmark location, visible from any part of the London area.\n\nIn 1985 a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] supermarket opened on Westow Street. In 1990 the exterior of this branch featured in a clip of the television drama series [[Grange Hill]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pwlx2H2Ud8 Grange Hill \u2013 Series 13 \u2013 Episode 12 at 4:20 mins] Accessed 24 August 2014</ref> The store was acquired by [[Morrisons]] in March 2004, who closed it in November 2005.

The former branch line terminus at [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|Crystal Palace High Level railway station]] which opened in 1865 closed in 1954, and the remaining [[Crystal Palace railway station]] is some distance below Upper Norwood, and approached by many steps.

Japan's 1993\u201394 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997\u201399 can be described as L-shaped. [[Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997\u201398, although [[Thailand]]\u2019s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |title=Key Indicators 2001: Growth and Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=ADB.org |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155544/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Psychological aspects===\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects.

Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession.<ref>{{cite news |author=Samuelson, Robert J. |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/13/AR2010061303330.html |title=Our economy's crisis of confidence |work=The Washington Post |date= 14 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.conference-board.org/economics/consumerconfidence.cfm |title=The Conference Board \u2013 Consumer Confidence Survey Press Release \u2013 May 2010 |publisher=Conference-board.org |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> The term [[Animal spirits (Keynes)|animal spirits]] has been used to describe the [[psychological]] factors underlying economic activity.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion \u2013 Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stock market==\nSome recessions have been anticipated by the stock market declines. In ''[[Stocks for the Long Run]]'', Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] were not followed by a recession.<ref>Siegel, Jeremy J.

Reagan supported that policy.

Consequently, modern [[government administration]]s attempt to take steps, also not agreed upon, to soften a recession.\n\n==Consequences==\n\n===Unemployment===\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the \"natural rate,\" in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in the gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].<ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf  Unemployment Rate] p. 1.

[[Pandemic|Global epidemics]], such as [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent movement of goods, services and people.\n\nRecessions have also provided opportunities for [[anti-competitive]] [[merger]]s, with a negative impact on the wider economy: the suspension of [[competition policy]] in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.<ref name=\"ESRC\" />\n\n===Social effects===\nThe [[living standards]] of people dependent on wages and [[salaries]] are not more affected by recessions than those who rely on [[fixed income]]s or [[welfare benefits]].

Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn't limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.  Australia is facing recession in 2020 due to the impact of the bush fires and the coronavirus impacting tourism and other important aspects of the economy.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|List of recessions in the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the [[late-2000s recession]].\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|List of recessions in the United States}}\nAccording to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion.<ref name=\"nber.org\" /> However, since 1980 there have been only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title=Percent change from preceding period|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)|accessdate=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814045606/https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and four periods considered recessions:\n* [[Early 1980s recession|July 1981 \u2013 November 1982]]: 15 months\n* [[Early 1990s recession|July 1990 \u2013 March 1991]]: 8 months\n* [[Early 2000s recession|March 2001 \u2013 November 2001]]: 8 months\n* [[Great Recession|December 2007 \u2013 June 2009]]: 18 months<ref>{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm?postversion=2008120112 |title=It's official: Recession since Dec.

Japan's 1993\u201394 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997\u201399 can be described as L-shaped.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion \u2013 Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stock market==\nSome recessions have been anticipated by the stock market declines.

Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the \"natural rate,\" in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in the gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].<ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf  Unemployment Rate] p. 1.

As a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931-1932 saw Australia's biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations, that underwent [[depression (economics)|depressions]], but their poor economic states influenced Australia's as well, that depended on them for export, as well as [[foreign investments]]. The nation also benefited from bigger productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with feeling the effects less.\n\nDue to a credit squeeze, the economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961\nAustralia was facing a rising level of [[inflation]] in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.<ref>{{citation | title= Australian Economic Indicators | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | date=27 February 1998 | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument }}</ref>\n\nAnother recession \u2013 the most recent one to date \u2013 came in the 1990s, at the beginning of the decade.

Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn't limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.  Australia is facing recession in 2020 due to the impact of the bush fires and the coronavirus impacting tourism and other important aspects of the economy.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|List of recessions in the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the [[late-2000s recession]].\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|List of recessions in the United States}}\nAccording to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion.<ref name=\"nber.org\" /> However, since 1980 there have been only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title=Percent change from preceding period|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)|accessdate=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814045606/https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and four periods considered recessions:\n* [[Early 1980s recession|July 1981 \u2013 November 1982]]: 15 months\n* [[Early 1990s recession|July 1990 \u2013 March 1991]]: 8 months\n* [[Early 2000s recession|March 2001 \u2013 November 2001]]: 8 months\n* [[Great Recession|December 2007 \u2013 June 2009]]: 18 months<ref>{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm?postversion=2008120112 |title=It's official: Recession since Dec.

The first Fox Sports Radio Colombia programs were broadcast on Fox Sports 2.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016, the localised feed increased the number of productions of local origin through disconnections with the main channel, such as Fox Gol Colombia and La Ultima Palabra, on July 12, 2015 and January 25, 2016, respectively.\n\nOn September 26, 2016, the localised feed became an independent channel and began broadcasting as Fox Sports Colombia along with the premiere of Central Fox Colombia.\n\nOn January 22, 2017, the double Sunday edition of Central Fox Colombia began to be broadcast. Two years later, on February 26, 2018, the evening edition of said informative space was launched, from Monday to Friday at 5:00 p.m.\n\nFrom the first broadcasts, the Central Fox Colombia newscast began with the hours of Sundays at 10:00 pm but in January 2017 the hours of 10:00 pm moved from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm\n\nDue to [[Disney]]'s [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]], Fox Sports Colombia ceased broadcasts on December 30, 2019 and was replaced by [[Fox Sports Latin America]]'s south feed.\n\n==Programming rights==\n\nEvents and competitions that were seen on Fox Sports Colombia.<ref>[http://www.eltiempo.com/entretenimiento/cine-y-tv/canal-fox-sports-en-colombia/16692681 Canal Fox Sports solo para Colombia.

During the first siege, a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force of around 1,300 men led by [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]] attacked the castle, which was the home of [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], a prominent [[Catholic]] and [[Cavaliers|Royalist]]. Arundell was absent, fighting for the King at the time of the attack, and the defence was led by his wife, [[Lady Blanche Arundell]], in command of 25 soldiers. The siege was started on 2 May, and lasted for a week before the Parliamentarians forced Lady Arundell to surrender on 8 May. The Parliamentarians garrisoned the castle with 75 men, led by Colonel [[Edmund Ludlow]].\n\n[[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], the son of Thomas and Blanche, brought a Royalist force to reclaim the castle, and by November 1643, a tight [[blockade]] had been established. The castle was well-provisioned, and it was only when the Royalists exploded mines under the walls, creating large holes in the defences, that they forced the castle's surrender. The damage to the castle left it uninhabitable, and over 100 years later, the [[Arundell family]] commissioned the [[New Wardour Castle]] to be built nearby.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Arundell family]] were prominent [[Catholics]]; [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]] was in and out of Royal favour, being arrested on multiple occasions, including in 1580 \"for his catholic zeal\", and later for accepting the title of [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1595. He was also suspected of involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt by dissident Catholics to assassinate [[James I of England|King James]].{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} His son, [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Thomas Arundell]] (later the second [[Baron Arundell of Wardour]], from 1639) married [[Lady Blanche Arundell|Lady Blanche Somerset]], herself daughter of the \"stiff papist\" [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester]].{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} Arundell's support of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] led to an arrest warrant being issued for him by parliament in November 1641,{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} and at the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]], he raised a cavalry regiment in support of the [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] cause, and left [[Wardour Castle]] to fight for the King.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n===Wardour Castle===\n{{main|Wardour Castle}}\nWardour Castle is located in southwest Wiltshire between the villages of [[Donhead St Andrew]] and [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], around {{convert|15|miles}} west of [[Salisbury]]. It was built in the late 14th century, by the [[Baron Lovel|5th Baron Lovel]], and bought by the Arundell family in the 1540s.{{sfn|Stanton|2009}} The castle was subsequently confiscated, and then bought back in 1570 by [[Matthew Arundell]], who oversaw its conversion to more of a [[English country house|stately home]], work that enlarged the windows and made it less defensible.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Despite these modifications, the castle remained a significant fortification, and was described by [[John Aubrey]] as being \"very strongly built of freestone\".{{sfn|Aubrey|1847|p=99}} The castle's defences were strengthened during the early stages of the Civil War.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==First siege==\n[[File:Blanche Arundell.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Lady Blanche Arundell]] held the castle for the Royalist cause in her husband's absence.]] \nOn 2 May 1643, [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]], the Parliamentarian commander-in-chief for the county of Wiltshire,{{sfn|Wroughton|2008}} arrived at Wardour Castle and ordered its surrender, as it was claimed to be a known refuge of Royalists (described contemporarily as \"cavaliers and malignants\").{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=1}} Lady Arundell refused, responding that \"she knew her duty and absolutely refused to deliver up the castle; she had a command from her lord to keep it, and she would obey his command\".{{sfn|Riley|2018|p=101}} Hungerford, finding that the castle was stronger than he had expected, added reinforcements to his force: troops out of Somerset commanded by Colonel [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]]. The combined force numbered around 1,300 men: in comparison, the castle housed around 55 people, only 25 of whom were able fighters. Alongside Lady Arundell, who was aged 60, was her daughter-in-law ([[Cicely Compton, Lady Arundell of Wardour|Cicely]]) with her three young children, and around fifty servants, including the guards and soldiers.{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=2}}\n\nThe castle was besieged for six days. Accounts from Royalists and Parliamentarians vary on the effectiveness of the siege: [[Bruno Ryves]], a Royalist propagandist, described that due to attacks which continued throughout day and night, the castle inhabitants were \"so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands\".{{sfn|Wright|2004}} In contrast, the Parliamentarian officer [[Edmund Ludlow]] wrote that when he arrived on 8 May, little damage had been done to the house other than to one of the chimneys.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\nOn the day of Ludlow's arrival, the Parliamentarians blew up two or three barrels of gunpowder under one of the castle walls, where there was an opening \"for the conveying away of filth\", and destroyed part of the wall.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Lady Arundell initially rejected the terms of surrender offered, which gave quarter to the women and children, but not the men. However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

MeasuringWorth.] Retrieved 14 November 2019.}} Many of the stolen goods were immediately sold at low prices, but the more valuable loot was transported with the women to [[Shaftesbury]]. The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander. Lady Arundell's grandchildren were held until July 1644, when they were released in a prisoner exchange for the children of a Parliamentarian.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==Second siege==\n[[File:Edmund Ludlow.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Edmund Ludlow]] held the castle for the Parliamentarians during the second siege.]]\nLudlow was appointed as the governor of Wardour Castle, and garrisoned the castle with 75 men,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} comprising his own cavalry troop and a company of infantry led by Captain Bean, from Hungerford's men.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}} The first challenge to the castle was posed by the [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], who had men posted at [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Lord Cottington]]'s house in nearby [[Fonthill Gifford]]. Hungerford's cavalry drove Marlborough's men from the area.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} Ludlow prepared for a potential blockade by removing the siege works his army had built around the castle, and sinking a well within it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}}\n\nIn a 1944 article in ''[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]]'', the historian H. F. Chettle suggests that [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]], who upon his father's death had become the third Baron Arundell of Wardour, established a siege \"a fortnight after he [Ludlow] had settled in\", which would place the second siege as starting in late May.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} In his memoirs, Ludlow said that Arundell arrived at the castle with some cavalry, and demanded that it surrender for the King. Ludlow refused, stating that he was holding it for Parliament, and \"could not surrender it without their command\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201324}} Arundell did not have sufficient men to enforce a siege, so withdrew back to join the bulk of Hertford's Royalist forces.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=24}} Although there was no formal blockade of the castle, the country around it was controlled by the Royalists.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201338}} \n\nLudlow recalls that two more approaches were made to the castle, one by a relation of Lord Cottington, and the other a friend of Ludlow's, [[Robert Phelips (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)|Robert Phelips]]. Both offered generous terms for the surrender of the castle to the Royalists, but in each case Ludlow refused, saying that he was \"resolved to run all hazards in the discharge of that trust which I had undertaken\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=25}} In order to stay well provisioned, the garrison ambushed farmers on their way to market in [[Shaftesbury]] and took their produce, recompensing them at market rates. The Royalists attempted to retake the castle by infiltrating the garrison with a young boy, reckoned by Ludlow to be \"not above twelve years of age\", into the castle. The boy had been tasked with poisoning the well and beer, sabotaging the weapons, counting the number of men in the garrison and then escaping. He was caught by the Parliamentarians and, after being threatened with execution, confessed.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=60}}\n\nTwo brothers, identified by the historian F. T. R. Edgar as Captain Henry Bowyer and Lieutenant Francis Bowyer, had command of two troops of [[dragoon]]s patrolling the area around the castle to defend against any sorties made by the garrison.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} In late October 1643, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] planned to recapture Wardour for the Royalists, but was forced to change his plans after the Royalist capture of [[Winchester]], and support the offensive in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] instead.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=58}} He was able to send reinforcements to the Bowyer brothers: [[Sir Charles Vavasour, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Vavasour]]'s infantry regiment and four artillery pieces.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} Ludlow's memoirs recount an approach by Captain Christopher Bowyer, who he says commanded the Royalist forces around the castle.{{efn|It is unclear whether the Captain Christopher Bowyer listed by Ludlow is one of the Bowyer brothers listed by Edgar.}} Bowyer tightened the blockade of the garrison, and demanded again that it surrender, threatening that more troops and artillery were on their way. Ludlow refused, and another member of the Parliamentarian garrison, Captain Bean, shot Bowyer in the heel. Bowyer died of the infected wound a couple of days later.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=29}}\n\nBy mid to late November, Hopton met with Lord Arundell and Vavasour at Fonthill, where he learnt that Vavasour's regiment were mutinous. After hanging the ringleaders, Hopton requisitioned the regiment to join him in Winchester, and left a 300-strong infantry regiment led by Colonel George Barnes to maintain the siege.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=148}} Barnes tightened the siege, keeping soldiers \"within pistol-shot of it [the castle] night and day\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=31}} Provisions within the castle began to run out; the well was dry by each evening,{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=61}} and they began slaughtering their horses for food.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=30}} In December, Hopton sent Sir [[Francis Dodington]] with further reinforcements to aid in capturing the castle, including an engineer and some miners with him from the [[Mendip Hills]].{{sfn|French|2013|pp=116\u2013117}} Dodington was a wealthy land-owner from Somerset, who had according to the historian Michael J. French, had \"an unenviable reputation for ruthlessness and brutality\".{{sfn|French|2013|p=112}}\n\nThe mining team began work on tunnelling under the castle's walls: after three months they were prepared to blow the walls.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} Dodington offered the garrison another chance to surrender, which Ludlow once again rejected, and a few days later the first mine was exploded. Two versions of the event are offered: Ludlow relates that when one of his large artillery guns fired, it caused one of the matches left burning by the Royalists to fall into the powder of the mine and detonate it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=34}} In Lise Hull's 2006 book, ''Britain's Medieval Castles'', she says that one of the Parliamentarian garrison \"unwittingly tossed a match into the tunnel where a mine lay hidden\".{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} The resulting explosion destroyed the west wall of the castle,{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} which according to Ludlow included the wall of his own room, from which he had to escape by dropping down onto a ladder {{convert|2|yards|spell=in}} below.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=34\u201335}} Despite preventing the Royalists  from storming the castle, Ludlow negotiated a surrender with Arundell and Dodington a few days later. They provided generous terms: quarter without distinction and civil usage for all, a speedy exchange, and not to be transported to [[Oxford]].{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Scars of Many an Age (10104333193).jpg|thumb|right|Wardour Castle was slighted after the Civil War]]\nDespite the terms agreed, two of the soldiers taken prisoner from the garrison were arrested and executed as Royalist deserters, and Ludlow was taken to Oxford, where he was imprisoned.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} He was quickly exchanged, and by July 1644 he had returned to Wiltshire as [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|High Sheriff]], and a colonel under Sir [[William Waller]].{{sfn|Firth|Worden|2006}}\n\nLord Arundell had reclaimed his family home but it was no longer habitable,{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} and he subsequently had it [[slighted]] to prevent further use as a garrison, moving the family home to [[Breamore]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Sherlock|2009}} A mansion was built near Wardour Castle, dubbed [[New Wardour Castle]], between 1770 and 1776 by [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1000507 |desc=Wardour Castle and Old Wardour Castle |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00aubruoft |title=The natural history of Wiltshire |last=Aubrey |first=John |authorlink=John Aubrey |year=1847 |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |location=London |oclc=697583041 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Chettle |first=H.

During the first siege, a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force of around 1,300 men led by [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]] attacked the castle, which was the home of [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], a prominent [[Catholic]] and [[Cavaliers|Royalist]]. Arundell was absent, fighting for the King at the time of the attack, and the defence was led by his wife, [[Lady Blanche Arundell]], in command of 25 soldiers. The siege was started on 2 May, and lasted for a week before the Parliamentarians forced Lady Arundell to surrender on 8 May. The Parliamentarians garrisoned the castle with 75 men, led by Colonel [[Edmund Ludlow]].\n\n[[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], the son of Thomas and Blanche, brought a Royalist force to reclaim the castle, and by November 1643, a tight [[blockade]] had been established. The castle was well-provisioned, and it was only when the Royalists exploded mines under the walls, creating large holes in the defences, that they forced the castle's surrender. The damage to the castle left it uninhabitable, and over 100 years later, the [[Arundell family]] commissioned the [[New Wardour Castle]] to be built nearby.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Arundell family]] were prominent [[Catholics]]; [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]] was in and out of Royal favour, being arrested on multiple occasions, including in 1580 \"for his catholic zeal\", and later for accepting the title of [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1595. He was also suspected of involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt by dissident Catholics to assassinate [[James I of England|King James]].{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} His son, [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Thomas Arundell]] (later the second [[Baron Arundell of Wardour]], from 1639) married [[Lady Blanche Arundell|Lady Blanche Somerset]], herself daughter of the \"stiff papist\" [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester]].{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} Arundell's support of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] led to an arrest warrant being issued for him by parliament in November 1641,{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} and at the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]], he raised a cavalry regiment in support of the [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] cause, and left [[Wardour Castle]] to fight for the King.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n===Wardour Castle===\n{{main|Wardour Castle}}\nWardour Castle is located in southwest Wiltshire between the villages of [[Donhead St Andrew]] and [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], around {{convert|15|miles}} west of [[Salisbury]]. It was built in the late 14th century, by the [[Baron Lovel|5th Baron Lovel]], and bought by the Arundell family in the 1540s.{{sfn|Stanton|2009}} The castle was subsequently confiscated, and then bought back in 1570 by [[Matthew Arundell]], who oversaw its conversion to more of a [[English country house|stately home]]; work that enlarged the windows and made it less defensible.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Despite these modifications, the castle remained a significant fortification, and was described by [[John Aubrey]] as being \"very strongly built of freestone\".{{sfn|Aubrey|1847|p=99}} The castle's defences were strengthened during the early stages of the Civil War.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==First siege==\n[[File:Blanche Arundell.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Lady Blanche Arundell]] held the castle for the Royalist cause in her husband's absence.]] \nOn 2 May 1643, [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]], the Parliamentarian commander-in-chief for the county of Wiltshire,{{sfn|Wroughton|2008}} arrived at Wardour Castle and ordered its surrender, as it was claimed to be a known refuge of Royalists (described contemporarily as \"cavaliers and malignants\").{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=1}} Lady Arundell refused, responding that \"she knew her duty and absolutely refused to deliver up the castle; she had a command from her lord to keep it, and she would obey his command\".{{sfn|Riley|2018|p=101}} Hungerford, finding that the castle was stronger than he had expected, added reinforcements to his force: troops out of Somerset commanded by Colonel [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]]. The combined force numbered around 1,300 men: in comparison, the castle housed around 55 people, only 25 of whom were able fighters. Alongside Lady Arundell, who was aged 60, was her daughter-in-law ([[Cicely Compton, Lady Arundell of Wardour|Cicely]]) with her three young children, and around fifty servants, including the guards and soldiers.{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=2}}\n\nThe castle was besieged for six days. Accounts from Royalists and Parliamentarians vary on the effectiveness of the siege: [[Bruno Ryves]], a Royalist propagandist, described that due to attacks which continued throughout day and night, the castle inhabitants were \"so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands\".{{sfn|Wright|2004}} In contrast, the Parliamentarian officer [[Edmund Ludlow]] wrote that when he arrived on 8 May, little damage had been done to the house other than to one of the chimneys.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\nOn the day of Ludlow's arrival, the Parliamentarians blew up two or three barrels of gunpowder under one of the castle walls, where there was an opening \"for the conveying away of filth\", and destroyed part of the wall.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Lady Arundell initially rejected the terms of surrender offered, which gave quarter to the women and children, but not the men. However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander. Lady Arundell's grandchildren were held until July 1644, when they were released in a prisoner exchange for the children of a Parliamentarian.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==Second siege==\n[[File:Edmund Ludlow.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Edmund Ludlow]] held the castle for the Parliamentarians during the second siege.]]\nLudlow was appointed as the governor of Wardour Castle, and garrisoned the castle with 75 men,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} comprising his own cavalry troop and a company of infantry led by Captain Bean, from Hungerford's men.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}} The first challenge to the castle was posed by the [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], who had men posted at [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Lord Cottington]]'s house in nearby [[Fonthill Gifford]]. Hungerford's cavalry drove Marlborough's men from the area.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} Ludlow prepared for a potential blockade by removing the siege works his army had built around the castle, and sinking a well within it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}}\n\nIn a 1944 article in ''[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]]'', the historian H. F. Chettle suggests that [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]], who upon his father's death had become the third Baron Arundell of Wardour, established a siege \"a fortnight after he [Ludlow] had settled in\", which would place the second siege as starting in late May.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} In his memoirs, Ludlow said that Arundell arrived at the castle with some cavalry, and demanded that it surrender for the King. Ludlow refused, stating that he was holding it for Parliament, and \"could not surrender it without their command\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201324}} Arundell did not have sufficient men to enforce a siege, so withdrew back to join the bulk of Hertford's Royalist forces.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=24}} Although there was no formal blockade of the castle, the country around it was controlled by the Royalists.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201338}} \n\nLudlow recalls that two more approaches were made to the castle, one by a relation of Lord Cottington, and the other a friend of Ludlow's, [[Robert Phelips (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)|Robert Phelips]]. Both offered generous terms for the surrender of the castle to the Royalists, but in each case Ludlow refused, saying that he was \"resolved to run all hazards in the discharge of that trust which I had undertaken\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=25}} In order to stay well provisioned, the garrison ambushed farmers on their way to market in [[Shaftesbury]] and took their produce, recompensing them at market rates. The Royalists attempted to retake the castle by infiltrating the garrison with a young boy, reckoned by Ludlow to be \"not above twelve years of age\", into the castle. The boy had been tasked with poisoning the well and beer, sabotaging the weapons, counting the number of men in the garrison and then escaping. He was caught by the Parliamentarians and, after being threatened with execution, confessed.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=60}}\n\nTwo brothers, identified by the historian F. T. R. Edgar as Captain Henry Bowyer and Lieutenant Francis Bowyer, had command of two troops of [[dragoon]]s patrolling the area around the castle to defend against any sorties made by the garrison.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} In late October 1643, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] planned to recapture Wardour for the Royalists, but was forced to change his plans after the Royalist capture of [[Winchester]], and support the offensive in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] instead.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=58}} He was able to send reinforcements to the Bowyer brothers: [[Sir Charles Vavasour, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Vavasour]]'s infantry regiment and four artillery pieces.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} Ludlow's memoirs recount an approach by Captain Christopher Bowyer, who he says commanded the Royalist forces around the castle.{{efn|It is unclear whether the Captain Christopher Bowyer listed by Ludlow is one of the Bowyer brothers listed by Edgar.}} Bowyer tightened the blockade of the garrison, and demanded again that it surrender, threatening that more troops and artillery were on their way. Ludlow refused, and another member of the Parliamentarian garrison, Captain Bean, shot Bowyer in the heel. Bowyer died of the infected wound a couple of days later.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=29}}\n\nBy mid to late November, Hopton met with Lord Arundell and Vavasour at Fonthill, where he learnt that Vavasour's regiment were mutinous. After hanging the ringleaders, Hopton requisitioned the regiment to join him in Winchester, and left a 300-strong infantry regiment led by Colonel George Barnes to maintain the siege.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=148}} Barnes tightened the siege, keeping soldiers \"within pistol-shot of it [the castle] night and day\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=31}} Provisions within the castle began to run out; the well was dry by each evening,{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=61}} and they began slaughtering their horses for food.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=30}} In December, Hopton sent Sir [[Francis Dodington]] with further reinforcements to aid in capturing the castle, including an engineer and some miners with him from the [[Mendip Hills]].{{sfn|French|2013|pp=116\u2013117}} Dodington was a wealthy land-owner from Somerset, who had according to the historian Michael J. French, had \"an unenviable reputation for ruthlessness and brutality\".{{sfn|French|2013|p=112}}\n\nThe mining team began work on tunnelling under the castle's walls: after three months they were prepared to blow the walls.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} Dodington offered the garrison another chance to surrender, which Ludlow once again rejected, and a few days later the first mine was exploded. Two versions of the event are offered: Ludlow relates that when one of his large artillery guns fired, it caused one of the matches left burning by the Royalists to fall into the powder of the mine and detonate it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=34}} In Lise Hull's 2006 book, ''Britain's Medieval Castles'', she says that one of the Parliamentarian garrison \"unwittingly tossed a match into the tunnel where a mine lay hidden\".{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} The resulting explosion destroyed the west wall of the castle,{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} which according to Ludlow included the wall of his own room, from which he had to escape by dropping down onto a ladder {{convert|2|yards|spell=in}} below.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=34\u201335}} Despite preventing the Royalists  from storming the castle, Ludlow negotiated a surrender with Arundell and Dodington a few days later. They provided generous terms: quarter without distinction and civil usage for all, a speedy exchange, and not to be transported to [[Oxford]].{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Scars of Many an Age (10104333193).jpg|thumb|right|Wardour Castle was slighted after the Civil War]]\nDespite the terms agreed, two of the soldiers taken prisoner from the garrison were arrested and executed as Royalist deserters, and Ludlow was taken to Oxford, where he was imprisoned.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} He was quickly exchanged, and by July 1644 he had returned to Wiltshire as [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|High Sheriff]], and a colonel under Sir [[William Waller]].{{sfn|Firth|Worden|2006}}\n\nLord Arundell had reclaimed his family home but it was no longer habitable,{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} and he subsequently had it [[slighted]] to prevent further use as a garrison, moving the family home to [[Breamore]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Sherlock|2009}} A mansion was built near Wardour Castle, dubbed [[New Wardour Castle]], between 1770 and 1776 by [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1000507 |desc=Wardour Castle and Old Wardour Castle |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00aubruoft |title=The natural history of Wiltshire |last=Aubrey |first=John |authorlink=John Aubrey |year=1847 |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |location=London |oclc=697583041 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Chettle |first=H.
