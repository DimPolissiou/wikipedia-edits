He was educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]], [[Lincoln's Inn]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]]. With his father's fortune he entered political life and became Member of Parliament for [[Petersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Petersfield]] in [[Hampshire]]. His [[maiden speech]], delivered on 13 November 1755, during the debate on the address, which excited [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]]'s admiration, is generally supposed to have been his only effort in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. But the nickname \"Single Speech\" is undoubtedly misleading, and Hamilton is known to have spoken with success on other occasions, both in the House of Commons and in the Irish parliament.\n\n===Political offices===\nIn 1756 he was appointed one of the commissioners for trade and plantations, and in 1761 he became chief secretary to [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], as well as [[Member of Parliament (pre-Union Ireland)|MP]] of the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[Killybegs (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Killybegs]] (until 1768) and English MP for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]].\n\nHe was appointed [[Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1763, and subsequently filled various other administrative offices. Hamilton was thought very highly of by [[Samuel Johnson]], and it is certain that he was strongly opposed to the British taxation of [[United States|America]]. He was close to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], serving as a trusted adviser.<ref name=\"HoP\"/> In 1784 he exchanged his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer for a pension of \u00a32,000 p.a.<ref name=\"HoP\"/> Hamilton had held the office for over 20 years, although had treated the role as a largely ceremonial position. He was succeeded by [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel|John Foster]], who went on to bring in changes credited with greatly boosting the rural Irish economy.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b68UBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=grattan+junta+1783&source=bl&ots=WvSRloWVcY&sig=NWdAx9-lh9pTJOMFsEwe-jEXdqM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcnf_lzu_RAhXHJ8AKHZOYDasQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=grattan%20junta%201783&f=false Ireland: A History from the Twelfth Century to the Present Day p.75]</ref>\n\n===Ill health and death===\nHe suffered from a severe paralytic stroke in the winter of 1791\u201392. This had not been his first, and by August 1792 he remained in a poor state. On 4 March 1793 he received a leave of absence from the House of Commons due to his ill health.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]].

The Gospel of John account varies significantly.<ref name=\"Puskas\"/>\n\nScholars do not agree on which events surrounding the death of Jesus should be considered part of the \"Passion narrative\", and which ones merely precede and succeed the actual Passion narrative itself.

After [[Saint Peter|Peter]] protests he will not, Jesus says Peter will deny him three times before the cock crows.\n* The [[Agony in the Garden]]: later that night at Gethsemane, Jesus prays while the disciples rest. [[Luke 22:43\u201344]] adds that Jesus was terrified, and sweat blood; however, the oldest manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke do not contain these two verses, the other three canonical gospels don't mention this event either, and various manuscripts contain these verses elsewhere, even in the Gospel of Matthew (suggesting repeated attempts at insertion); thus, most modern scholars consider this tradition a later [[Christian interpolation]], probably to counter [[docetism]].<ref name=Aland>{{Cite book |last=Aland |first= Kurt |authorlink=Kurt Aland |last2=Aland |first2=Barbara |authorlink2=Barbara Aland |others=Erroll F.

During the arrest in Gethsemane, someone (Peter according to John) takes a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant, Malchus.\n* The [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]] at the high priest's palace, later that night. The arresting party brings Jesus to the [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish supreme court); according to Luke's Gospel, Jesus is beaten by his Jewish guards prior to his examination;<ref>{{bible verse||Luke|22:63}}</ref> the court examines him, in the course of which, according to John's Gospel, Jesus is struck in the face by one of the Jewish officials;<ref>{{bibleverse||John|18:22}}</ref> the court determine he deserves to die. According to Matthew's Gospel, the court then \"[[Mocking of Jesus#First stage|spat in his face and struck him with their fists.]]\"<ref>{{bible verse||Matthew|26:67}}</ref> They then send him to [[Pontius Pilate]]. According to the synoptic gospels, the high priest who examines Jesus is [[Caiaphas]]; in John, Jesus is also interrogated by [[Annas]], Caiaphas' father-in-law.\n* The [[Denial of Peter]] in the courtyard outside the high priest's palace, the same time. Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus\u2019 fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>  Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on  Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role.  Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version.  Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC).  This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people.  By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God.  The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy.  For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.  He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second  prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross.  From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah.  For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people.  All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019  Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper... Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books.  But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion.  For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn... He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God...and glorieth that he hath God for his father.  Let us see then if his words be true... For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.  Let us examine him by outrages and tortures... Let us condemn him to a most shameful death ... These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.  Namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them.  He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water... For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019  And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third ''prophecy'', the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the ''cup'' he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others.  Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to ''the Passion''. The ''cup'' is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross.  Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service.  These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (''i.e.'': when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\") <ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion\u2014from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]\u2014during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777.  Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day.  During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes  prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nFor a full list of the subjects forming narrative works of art on the Passion, or episodes from it, see [[Life of Christ in art]].  Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects.  The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions.  [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story.  The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].   Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]].  This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]].  The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours.  They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''.  The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King.  [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section.  One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels.

It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates.

[[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution.

Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, ''Alexander'' and ''Rufus.'' However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\")<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>  Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on  Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role.  Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version.  Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC).  This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people.  By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God.  The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy.  For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.  He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second  prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross.  From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah.  For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people.  All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019  Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper... Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books.  But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion.  For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn... He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God...and glorieth that he hath God for his father.  Let us see then if his words be true... For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.  Let us examine him by outrages and tortures... Let us condemn him to a most shameful death ... These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.  Namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them.  He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water... For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019  And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third ''prophecy'', the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the ''cup'' he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others.  Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to ''the Passion''. The ''cup'' is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross.  Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service.  These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (''i.e.'': when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\") <ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion\u2014from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]\u2014during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777.  Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day.  During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes  prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nFor a full list of the subjects forming narrative works of art on the Passion, or episodes from it, see [[Life of Christ in art]].  Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects.  The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions.  [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story.  The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].   Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]].  This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]].  The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours.  They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''.  The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King.  [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section.  One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels. [[Holy Week in Spain]] retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.\n\n====In Latin America====\nDuring the Passion week many towns in [[Mexico]] have a representation of the passion.\n\n====In Spain====\nDuring the Passion week many cities and towns in [[Spain]] have a representation of the Passion. \n\nMany Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and ''[[Vita Christi|Vitae Christi]]'', and also a popular ''Monotessaron'' or ''Pasi\u00f3n de l'eterno principe Jesucristo'' attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide.

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|285x285px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument]]\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Zgrada Skup\u0161tine grada Bijeljine 1.jpg|thumb|283x283px|The assembly building of Bijeljina]]\nIn 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893\u201395.<ref>[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo], Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\nIn front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Usta\u0161a]] removed it. After [[World War II]], the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 POW camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers.

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|285x285px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument]]\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Zgrada Skup\u0161tine grada Bijeljine 1.jpg|thumb|283x283px|The assembly building of Bijeljina]]\nIn 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893\u201395.<ref>[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo], Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\nIn front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Usta\u0161a]] removed it. After [[World War II]], the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 POW camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers.

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]].

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]].

Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours on Internet [[chat room]]s with his girlfriends and aspiring to be a [[Cage fighting|cage fighter]]. Napoleon [[daydream]]s his way through school, doodling [[liger]]s and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock Don and the school bully Randy. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself and his outlandish \"skills\" while having a sullen and aloof personality.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother breaks her [[coccyx]] in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious steak-loving former athlete who lives in a [[campervan]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and his recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua|Juarez]], [[Mexico]]. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon out of pity.\n\nInspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The two candidates' factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] and buys an instructional dance [[VHS]] called ''D-Qwon's Dance Grooves'', becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend LaFawnduh arrives from [[Detroit]] and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger than Life]]\" by the [[Backstreet Boys]] with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" by [[Jamiroquai]]. Napoleon's routine receives a [[standing ovation]] from students, stunning Summer and her boyfriend Don.\n\nThe film concludes with Pedro becoming the class president, Kip and LaFawnduh leaving on a bus for Michigan, Rico reuniting with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returning from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconciling and playing [[tetherball]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Kip and LaFawnduh are married in an outdoor ceremony in Preston. Napoleon, absent for the vows, arrives riding a horse, claiming that it is a \"wild honeymoon stallion\" that he has tamed himself. Kip flicks LaFawnduh's garter as a keepsake towards Napoleon, Pedro, and Rico (who catches it) before he and LaFawnduh ride off across the fields.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Napoleon Dynamite cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The cast of ''Napoleon Dynamite'' (from left to right: Majorino, Martin, Heder, Ruell, Ramirez, Gries, and Bader)]]\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Napoleon Dynamite\n* [[Efren Ramirez]] as Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as Deborah \"Deb\" Bradshaw\n* [[Aaron Ruell]] as Kipland \"Kip\" Dynamite\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Rico Dynamite\n* [[Haylie Duff]] as Summer Wheatley\n* [[Emily Dunn (actress)|Emily Kennard]] as Trisha Stevens\n* [[Shondrella Avery]] as LaFawnduh Lucas\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Grandma Carlinda Dynamite\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Rex\n* Trevor Snarr as Don\n* [[Ellen Dubin]] as Aunt Ilene\n\n==Production==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Pedros house from Napoleon Dynamite.jpg|thumb|right|Pedro's house, located in Preston, Idaho.]]\n{{See also|Peluca}}\n[[Jon Heder]] and [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] were students at the film program at [[Brigham Young University]] in 2002 and decided to collaborate on a class project.

Eight months after the film was completed, the title sequence was filmed in cinematographer Munn Powell's basement.<ref name=\"hess-aott\">{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/2010/08/30/napoleon-dynamite/ | title = A Q&A with director Jared Hess. |first=Alexander |last=Ulloa | accessdate = 2010-09-03 |work = [[Art of the Title]]}}</ref> [[Aaron Ruell]], who played Kip, suggested the idea of the title sequence. The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a [[Lemonhead (candy)|Lemonheads]] box or a tube of [[ChapStick]] had the credits printed on them. Hess explains:\n{{Quote|text=So this question came up a few times and the Fox Searchlight marketing people were like \"maybe we could do something to say that this is happening now\" because I kept explaining to them that I grew up in a small town in Idaho and that things are more, you know, functional and fashion doesn't matter as much ... It's kind of weird, but because they wanted to show that the film takes place now, there's a title where a hand pulls Napoleon's school ID out of a wallet and it says \"2004\"<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\nOn the studio's reaction to the sequence, Hess adds:\n{{Quote|text=We actually had Jon Heder placing all the objects in and out [of frame], and then showed it to Searchlight who really liked it and thought it was great, but some lady over there was like \"There are some hangnails or something \u2014 the hands look kinda gross! It's really bothering me, can we re-shoot some of those? We'll send you guys a [[hand model]].\" We were like \"WHAT?!\". This, of course, was my first interaction with a studio at all, so they flew out a hand model a couple weeks later, who had great hands but was five or six shades darker than Jon Heder. So we reshot, but they're now intermixed, so if you look there are like three different dudes' hands (our producers are in there too). It all worked out great, though, and was a lot of fun.<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\n\n===Dance scene===\nThe Hesses wrote the climactic dance scene because they knew Heder liked to dance.<ref name=\"dance scene\">{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Patail |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2012/2/27/interview-with-jon-heder-of-napoleon-dynamite-february-2012 |title=Exclusive Interview with Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite |work=[[Portland Monthly]] |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2018-08-15 }}</ref> \"Jared's wife was like, 'Jon, I hear you're pretty good dancer. I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\"\n\nWhen it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\"/>\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\nThe dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\">{{cite video |title=Napoleon Dynamite-(Commentary by Jared Hess, Actor Jon Heder and Producer Jeremy Coon) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |date=2005}}</ref> \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.' So I just winged it. I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n\"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive.

Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours on Internet [[chat room]]s with his girlfriends and aspiring to be a [[Cage fighting|cage fighter]]. Napoleon [[daydream]]s his way through school, doodling [[liger]]s and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock Don and the school bully Randy. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself and his outlandish \"skills\" while having a sullen and aloof personality.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother breaks her [[coccyx]] in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious steak-loving former athlete who lives in a [[campervan]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and his recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua|Juarez]], [[Mexico]]. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon out of pity.\n\nInspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The two candidates' factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] and buys an instructional dance [[VHS]] called ''D-Qwon's Dance Grooves'', becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend LaFawnduh arrives from [[Detroit]] and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger than Life]]\" by the [[Backstreet Boys]] with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" by [[Jamiroquai]].

Audiences at test screenings were confused about when the film was set. Eight months after the film was completed, the title sequence was filmed in cinematographer Munn Powell's basement.<ref name=\"hess-aott\">{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/2010/08/30/napoleon-dynamite/ | title = A Q&A with director Jared Hess. |first=Alexander |last=Ulloa | accessdate = 2010-09-03 |work = [[Art of the Title]]}}</ref> [[Aaron Ruell]], who played Kip, suggested the idea of the title sequence. The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a [[Lemonhead (candy)|Lemonheads]] box or a tube of [[ChapStick]] had the credits printed on them. Hess explains:\n{{Quote|text=So this question came up a few times and the Fox Searchlight marketing people were like \"maybe we could do something to say that this is happening now\" because I kept explaining to them that I grew up in a small town in Idaho and that things are more, you know, functional and fashion doesn't matter as much ... It's kind of weird, but because they wanted to show that the film takes place now, there's a title where a hand pulls Napoleon's school ID out of a wallet and it says \"2004\"<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\nOn the studio's reaction to the sequence, Hess adds:\n{{Quote|text=We actually had Jon Heder placing all the objects in and out [of frame], and then showed it to Searchlight who really liked it and thought it was great, but some lady over there was like \"There are some hangnails or something \u2014 the hands look kinda gross!

This, of course, was my first interaction with a studio at all, so they flew out a hand model a couple weeks later, who had great hands but was five or six shades darker than Jon Heder. So we reshot, but they're now intermixed, so if you look there are like three different dudes' hands (our producers are in there too). It all worked out great, though, and was a lot of fun.<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\n\n===Dance scene===\nThe Hesses wrote the climactic dance scene because they knew Heder liked to dance.<ref name=\"dance scene\">{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Patail |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2012/2/27/interview-with-jon-heder-of-napoleon-dynamite-february-2012 |title=Exclusive Interview with Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite |work=[[Portland Monthly]] |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2018-08-15 }}</ref> \"Jared's wife was like, 'Jon, I hear you're pretty good dancer. I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\"\n\nWhen it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\"/>\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\nThe dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\">{{cite video |title=Napoleon Dynamite-(Commentary by Jared Hess, Actor Jon Heder and Producer Jeremy Coon) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |date=2005}}</ref> \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.'

I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n\"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive. So we danced to three different songs. To that song and another Jamiroquai song, \"[[Little L]].\" We danced to Michael Jackson, something off of ''[[Off the Wall]]''. Just those three. And then we got the rights to Jamiroquai. And I think that was half our budget.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n===Origin of the name \"Napoleon Dynamite\"===\nUpon the film's release, it was noted that the name \"Napoleon Dynamite\" had originally been used by musician [[Elvis Costello]], most visibly on his 1986 album ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.elviscostello.info/disc/official/bac/bac_info_a02.htm |title = Blood And Chocolate (reissue) - Elvis Costello And The Attractions |work = The Elvis Costello Home Page |date=October 1, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/trivia |title=Napoleon Dynamite (2004): Trivia|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> although he had used the pseudonym on a single B-side as early as 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/disc/official/ib/ib_info_s02.htm |title=The Elvis Costello Home Page |work=The Elvis Costello Home Page |date=1982-07-23 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> Filmmaker [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] states that he was not aware of Costello's use of the name until two days before the end of shooting, when he was informed by a teenage [[extra (actor)|extra]].<ref name=\"stereogum\">{{cite web |work=[[Stereogum]] |url=http://stereogum.com/archives/napoleon-dynamite-vs-elvis-costello_000693.html |title=Napoleon Dynamite vs. Elvis Costello |date=July 10, 2004}}</ref> He later said, \"Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film, it definitely would have been changed&nbsp;...

television series, produced in the United Kingdom by Sid Gentle Films for [[BBC America]]. The series follows [[Eve Polastri]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] investigator tasked with capturing psychopathic assassin [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]] ([[Jodie Comer]]); as the chase progresses, the two [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|develop a mutual obsession]]. Based on the ''[[Codename Villanelle|Villanelle]]'' novel series by [[Luke Jennings]], each of the show's series has featured a different female [[showrunner]]. [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]] was head writer of the first series, while [[Emerald Fennell]] took over for the second series. Suzanne Heathcote will serve as showrunner for the third series.\n\nThe show has been highly successful in both the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving critical acclaim for both the first and second series, particularly for its writing and the lead actresses' performances. The first series had unbroken weekly ratings increases, among adults especially. It has received several accolades, including a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]]. Both Oh and Comer have won multiple Best Actress awards for their roles, with [[Fiona Shaw]] winning one for Best Supporting Actress as Carolyn Martens.\n\nBy January 2020, ''Killing Eve'' had been renewed for both a third and a fourth series.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite web |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |title=''Killing Eve'' Renewed for Season 3 |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/08/killing-eve-renewed-season-3/ |website=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=8 April 2019 |location=United States |date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/03/killing-eve-renewed-season-4/|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 January 2020|title=Killing Eve renewed for season 4|last=Snierson|first=Dan}}</ref> The third series premiered on 12 April 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\nBored with her protection role within the British intelligence agencies, [[Eve Polastri]] is overly interested with female assassins, their psychologies, and their methods of killing. After brashly investigating behind-the-scenes in relation to a witness she is handling, she is fired from [[MI5]]; however, to her delight, she is recruited by a secret division within [[MI6]] chasing an international assassin who calls herself [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]]. Eve crosses paths with Villanelle and discovers that members within both of their secret circles may be more interconnected than she is comfortable with, but forms [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|an obsession with Villanelle that is more enthusiastically reciprocated]]. Both women begin to focus less on their initial missions in order to desperately seek more about the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/killing-eve/about|title=About the Show|website=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[Eve Polastri]], an agent with [[MI5]] (the UK's domestic [[counter-intelligence]] and security agency) who becomes obsessed with a notorious assassin and is recruited on an off-the-books basis to the foreign [[intelligence agency]] [[MI6]].\n* [[Jodie Comer]] as [[Villanelle (character)|Oksana Astankova / Villanelle]], a psychopathic, skilled assassin who becomes obsessed with the MI5 officer who is tracking her.\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Carolyn Martens, head of the Russia Section at [[MI6]].\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] as Konstantin Vasiliev, Villanelle's handler.\n* [[Owen McDonnell]] as Niko Polastri, Eve's English-Polish husband, a teacher.\n* Sean Delaney as Kenny Stowton, Carolyn's son, an ex-hacker who has been recruited by MI6.

The oldest material traces of a religious building on the site date back to the 10th century. Three churches preceding the current construction were identified during excavations carried out in 1967. The current building was built between 1750 and 1753 in a classical style, by an anonymous architect.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=33}}</ref> The brick and limestone church is quite homogeneous. It's composed of six [[bay (architecture)|bay]]ed [[nave]]s flanked by [[aisle]]s, a three-sided [[transept]] and a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] with a polygonal [[ambulatory]] with a [[sacristy]] in its axis. The [[chamfer]]ed [[Foundation (architecture)|base]] is in [[dimension stone]] on the frontage, in rubble stones and [[sandstone]] for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is [[Boss (architecture)|bossed]]. The church has been listed as a [[Heritage registers in Belgium|Belgian cultural heritage]] site since 1949.\n\n== Historical context ==\nBoth the church and Jumet itself were cited in 868 in the [[Polyptych (document)|polyptych]] of [[Lobbes Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=100}}</ref> Despite its age, it is rarely mentioned in records. Most of the relevant documents were probably lost in the destruction of the [[State Archives in Belgium|State Archives]] in [[Mons]] and of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tournai|episcopal archives of Tournai]] at the beginning of the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=12}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[French Revolution]], Jumet was part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]]; the [[abbot]] of [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]] was [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[Manorialism|lord]] by appointment of the [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Li\u00e8ge|Prince-bishop]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=52}}</ref> However, its neighbouring states, [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], challenged Li\u00e8ge's claim to Jumet. Over time, Brabant gained in influence, which seemed in accordance with the local population's wish.<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=53}}</ref> By the 1730s, Brabant was acting as if it completely owned Jumet. During the 1740s, Duchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria and the [[Council of Brabant]] instituted administrative reforms at the request of the [[mayor]] and the magistrate. On 28 June 1780, Prince-Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck]] officially yielded the lordship of Jumet to Brabant.<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=61}}</ref> During the [[History of Belgium#French control|period of French rule]], Jumet belonged to the [[Jemmape (department)|department of Jemappes]], which became part of the [[Hainaut (province)|province of Hainaut]] after the fall of [[Napoleon]].\n\nThe church's predecessors, whose [[patron saint]] remains unknown, belonged to a [[parish]] of the old [[deanery]] of [[Fleurus]], part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|diocese of Li\u00e8ge]]. In 1559, during reforms of the episcopal hierarchy of the [[Low Countries]], this parish was first assigned to the newly created [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur|diocese of Namur]],<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> and later to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur|diocese of Tournai]] in the [[Concordat of 1801]].\n\n== The excavation of 1967 ==\nIn 1967, the church underwent a major restoration led by {{ill|Simon Brigode|fr}}, architect and professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|University of Leuven]]. During this restoration, [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s were conducted by {{ill|Luc-Francis Genicot|fr}}, [[assistant professor]] at the University of Leuven, from 16\u201322 August 1967.\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967 - tranch\u00e9es-en.svg|upright=1.5|alt=Layout of excavation|thumb|left|Layout of the August 1967 excavation]]\nThese excavations were conducted in a limited area which turned out to be of significance.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=9}}</ref> although the restoration work had already destroyed some of the ancient foundations.<ref name=\"gen18\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=18}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the current church had already profoundly modified the earlier site. The 18th-century flooring is lower than earlier levels; only the lowest levels of the old [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] still remained. During the excavations they found no foundation, no under-pavement, no lime mortar runoff, and no [[altar (Catholicism)|altar]] base.<ref name=\"gen18\"/> The sepulchre lay {{convert|19|cm|in}} under the current flooring level only.<ref name=\"gen19\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=19}}</ref>\n\nThe work done in the 19th and 20th centuries removed ancient traces. A thin brick gutter to hold [[gas lighting]] pipes was installed during the second half of the 19th century, cutting across the ''B'' trench.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=22}}</ref> An early 20th-century gutter, constructed roughly along the lengthwise axis of the current church, cut through the old foundations.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=20}}</ref>\n\nThese surveys made it possible to correctly locate the building's successive stages of growth.<ref name=\"gen19\"/>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n== The successive churches ==\nThree religious buildings that preceded the current church were uncovered during the excavations.\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967-en.svg|alt=|thumb|left|upright=2|Superimposed plans of churches 1, 3 and 4.]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n=== First church ===\n[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], the first building was formed of a rectangular chamber composed of a plain [[nave]] {{convert|4.7|m|yd}} wide, whose length the excavations did not manage to determine. It is possible that as in other small churches of the [[early Middle Ages]], the length of the church was double its width. This edifice may have been the church consecrated between 959 and 971 by Eraclus, abbot of [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]] and bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]], which was mentioned in the \"Eraclus charter\".<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=25}}</ref>\n\n=== Second church ===\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967 - phase 2-en.svg|alt=|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Superimposed plans of churches 2 and 3.]]\nDuring the excavation, the only trace of the second church that was found is the foundation of an irregular three-sided [[apse]]. It is unclear how the building developed towards the [[narthex]]. We do know that this side ended with a tower because Jehan Camal, the local [[priest]], in his will of 1517, bequeathed 50 [[French livre|livres]] towards the repairing of the tower and the installation of a [[Church bell|bell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=102}}</ref> The tower is probably the same one that was mentioned in the 17th century and that was subsequently demolished for the construction of the 18th century church.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=30}}</ref> The size of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] suggests a three-apsed construction, maybe similar to the third church.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=27}}</ref> As well as the main altar, a [[Pouill\u00e9 (ecclesiastical register)|''Pouill\u00e9'']] ecclesiastical register from 1445 mentioned an altar devoted to [[Saint Nicholas]], and another from 1518 mentions an altar devoted to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=101}}</ref>\n\nNoting the similarities to the choir in Saint-Martin's church at [[Marcinelle]], rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, Luc-Francis Genicot hypothesised that it took inspiration from Jumet's earlier design, possibly from the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=28}}</ref>\n\nIn the choir lies a burial place containing a skeleton in a nailed oak coffin. The presence of embroidered cloth and the location suggests that it is the tomb of a priest, probably the local [[parson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n=== Third church ===\n[[File:Jumet_-_%C3%A9glise_Saint-Sulpice_-_fa%C3%A7ade_nord_-_fondations_des_%C3%A9difices_pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9dents.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Foundations of previous buildings]]\nThe choir of the third edifice probably dates back to the middle of the 17th century.<ref name=\"ref3\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=36}}</ref> This church is eight times bigger than the first. The choir is of a [[pentagon]]al design {{convert|8.25|m|yd}} deep. It is consolidated by four [[buttress]]es, suggesting that it was once covered by a solid [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], probably of [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] design. The nave, {{convert|22|m|yd}} long and of an estimated width of {{convert|20|m|yd}}, is slightly [[Trapezoid|trapezium]]-shaped<ref>Considering that the restitution is correct, because the south-west angle hasn't been maintained {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=30}}.</ref> and has two [[aisle]]s. The scale of the aisles lets us imagine a building of the [[hall church]] type, like many that existed in Hainault in the 15th and 16th century.\n\nThe tower stands against the church frontage. It underwent an important restoration in 1670 and a clock was installed in 1681. This bell-tower was probably square and roughly {{convert|6.4|m|yd}} long on each side. It was capped by an octagonal pointed spire, topped by a big [[finial]] cross and a weathercock reaching to {{convert|38|m|yd}} high.<ref name=\"ref1\" />\n\nIn 1710, the state of the church again called for serious repairs, and Jumet's [[bailiff]], Jean de Vigneron, asked the abbot of Lobbes, a big [[tithe]] collector, to build a new church. The abbey could not meet the expense.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=103}}</ref> Finally, after a lawsuit{{clarify|date=August 2017}}, an agreement was reached for the repairs to the church including the choir, the tower and the roof of the nave.<ref name=\"ref5\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Present church ===\n[[File:Jumet - \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice - Plan, coupes transversale et verticale, et \u00e9l\u00e9vation des fa\u00e7ades principale et lat\u00e9rale - feuille E - coup\u00e9e.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Section and elevation of the first draft of the 18th century with the old tower held (sheet ''E'').]]\nThe present church was built between 1750 and 1753 by an anonymous architect. The original plans consist of five coloured sheets.<ref>Kept at [[State Archives in Belgium]] {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}</ref> They have been numbered from ''A '' to ''E'' without any obvious order, probably after the completion of the construction. The ''C'' sheet did not belong to the first file, but the five drawings are from the same author. The ''E'' sheet has notes on the back where the name of ''D. De Lados'' appears twice, suggesting that it could be the name of the architect.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nBefore 1750, the old church was demolished and the ground levelled.<ref name=\"gen18\"/> This levelling is probably why the present church isn't correctly [[Orientation of churches|oriented]], unlike the original church, whose choir perfectly faced east.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=104}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fa\u00e7ade nord - remploi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Details of materials reused in the current facing of the north facade.]]\nThe design was ambitious and excessive for the locals of the time. Tensions took place between the architect and the sponsors, including the abbot of Lobbes, Th\u00e9odulphe Barnab\u00e9 (abbot from 1728 to 1752).<ref name=\"ref5\" /> Construction lagged and, even though old materials were re-used in the base and the pavements,<ref name=\"ref3\" /> the cost was five times the original estimate : {{centered pull quote|We have been greatly wronged for the erection of this church[...]because the church building, instead of costing us twenty thousand [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s, is now costing us at least a hundred thousand [...] The architect has deceived us by increasing the length of the so-mentioned church by twenty-nine feet, and many other things|author=Complaint quoted by L-F. Genicot|source=<ref name=\"ref5\" />}}\n\nThe initial plan intended to re-integrate the old tower. An amendment definitely scrapped all the past.<ref name=\"ref3\" /> This project of a new tower probably belonged to that part of the ''many other things'' that were mentioned in the complaint.\n[[File:Jumet - \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice - Plan, coupes transversale et verticale, et \u00e9l\u00e9vation des fa\u00e7ades principale et lat\u00e9rale - feuille C.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century drawing of a proposed new facade (sheet'' C'')]]\nThis conflict ended with a trial before the Sovereign Council of Brabant. The architect was forced to reduce the scale of the project. This is evident by examining the successive frontage projects<ref name=\"ref6\" /> and comparing the size of the achieved high parts and the planned size on the original elevation drawing. The construction continued but with some delay. The church was finished in 1753.<ref name=\"ref3\" />\n\nThe steeple was designed to receive three bells. Two bells are attested, and there is no formal proof of the existence of the third.<ref name=\"ref8\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=104 ; 106}}</ref>\n\nOn the east side, a bell from 1590 is adorned with the image of the Virgin and has the inscription: ''Micael Willelmus coadiutor Lobiensis me fecit<ref>Michel Willame was co-helper from 1580 to 1598 of the abbey of Lobbes, Ermin Fran\u00e7ois, he was elected himself in 1598 and died in 1600 {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}.</ref> \u2013 1590 \u2013 Ma\u00eetre Jean Grongnart, founder''<ref name=\"ref8\" /><ref>Jean Grongnart belongs to a dynasty of founders that worked in Hainaut during the 16th and 17th century {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nOn the west side, the second bell was probably in bad shape because it was remelted in 1772, as the inscription attests : ''+ In the year 1772 I was remelted at the expense of the community of Jumet by Simon Chevresson and Deforest.''<ref name=\"ref8\" />\n\nIt's probable that the [[French revolution]] induced structural damage because a budget was allocated by the local administration for the repair of window panes and the roof in 1797.<ref name=\"ref9\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=105}}</ref> In 1808, three new altars were built.<ref name=\"ref7\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=41}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, the church underwent an important restoration. Part of the pavement was replaced, a new set of furniture was put in, the altars transformed<ref name=\"ref9\" /> and the master altar re-dedicated.<ref name=\"ref7\" />\n\nIn the brickwork of the master altar, removed during the 1968 restorations, a wooden [[reliquary]] casket with a glass lid was discovered. It contained two bones held together by a copper thread. Between them was a paper document in a very bad shape, nearly unreadable, dated 1835. Possibly that the reliquary is older than that and was put there when the altar was re-devoted.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=40\u201341}}</ref><ref>[http://balat.kikirpa.be/photo.php?path=B205941&objnr=10048113 Photography of the reliquary] on the website of the [[Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage]]</ref>\n\nIn 1840, a [[pipe organ]] was installed, the work of [[organ builder]] Hypolite Loret of [[Brussels]]. The instrument was upgraded in 1873.<ref name=\"ref9\" />\n\nIn 1943, German occupation authorities commandeered the bells.

Similarly conceived half-windows are found on the second level in the background, under the [[cornice]].{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nThe frontage has two levels, with above them a curved [[pediment]]. On the first level, two belts proceed further than the central part to the side frontages under the [[volute]]d ailerons placed on both sides of the second level. Above the pediment, a square tower is made up of two stories separated by a belt. The tower has a polygonal steeple on a pyramidal base. The limestone portal is preceded by several steps. It's flanked by [[pilaster]]s with crosswalls that hold an [[entablature]] and a curved pediment. There is an arched door.{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nA secondary door, preceded by ten steps, is pierced by the first north aisle bay.\n\nThe interior is quite bright, painted in white and grey. It is covered by [[barrel vault]]s. The [[column]]s of the nave are of [[Tuscan order|tuscan]] style. The [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] of the choir and of the transept are crowned with a [[volute]]d [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s.{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nThe church contains noted [[panelling]] and furniture.<ref name=\"paysdecharleroi.be\">\n{{cite web |url= http://www.paysdecharleroi.be/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=157:patrimoine-religieux&id=203231:eglise-saint-suplice-%C3%A0-jumet&Itemid=716&lang=en |title= Saint-Suplice church in Jumet |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Le pays de Charleroi |publisher= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the church is a [[baptismal font]] from the 11th or 12th century. It consists of a stone bowl slightly flared but circular, flanked by four engaged columns on a base. The columns end with a roughly cut human head, of which two out of four are missing. The style is Romanesque and the font archaic: straight nose and barely cleared, skin-deep eyes, mouth expressionless. These details are characteristic of Romanesque workshops from the 11th and 12th centuries. However, the disposal of Jumet differs from other fonts known by the feature that the heads are borne directly by columns. Usually, the head is supported in cantilever by a kind of console, as is the case, for example, in [[Gerpinnes]].{{sfn|Brigode|1936|p=6-8}}\n\nThe furniture also contains an altar devoted to

{{IPA-fr|s\u025b\u0303sylpis}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Jumet]], a neighborhood of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] town of [[Charleroi]] in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Wallonia]].{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}} It is dedicated to [[Sulpitius the Pious]]. The oldest material traces of a religious building on the site date back to the 10th century. Three churches preceding the current construction were identified during excavations carried out in 1967. The current building was built between 1750 and 1753 in a classical style, by an anonymous architect.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=33}}</ref> The brick and limestone church is quite homogeneous. It's composed of six [[bay (architecture)|bay]]ed [[nave]]s flanked by [[aisle]]s, a three-sided [[transept]] and a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] with a polygonal [[ambulatory]] with a [[sacristy]] in its axis. The [[chamfer]]ed [[Foundation (architecture)|base]] is in [[dimension stone]] on the frontage, in rubble stones and [[sandstone]] for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is [[Boss (architecture)|bossed]]. The church has been listed as a [[Heritage registers in Belgium|Belgian cultural heritage]] site since 1949.\n\n== Historical context ==\nBoth the church and Jumet itself were cited in 868 in the [[Polyptych (document)|polyptych]] of [[Lobbes Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=100}}</ref> Despite its age, it is rarely mentioned in records. Most of the relevant documents were probably lost in the destruction of the [[State Archives in Belgium|State Archives]] in [[Mons]] and of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tournai|episcopal archives of Tournai]] at the beginning of the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=12}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[French Revolution]], Jumet was part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]]; the [[abbot]] of [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]] was [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[Manorialism|lord]] by appointment of the [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Li\u00e8ge|Prince-bishop]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=52}}</ref> However, its neighbouring states, [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], challenged Li\u00e8ge's claim to Jumet. Over time, Brabant gained in influence, which seemed in accordance with the local population's wish.<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=53}}</ref> By the 1730s, Brabant was acting as if it completely owned Jumet. During the 1740s, Duchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria and the [[Council of Brabant]] instituted administrative reforms at the request of the [[mayor]] and the magistrate. On 28 June 1780, Prince-Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck]] officially yielded the lordship of Jumet to Brabant.<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=61}}</ref> During the [[History of Belgium#French control|period of French rule]], Jumet belonged to the [[Jemmape (department)|department of Jemappes]], which became part of the [[Hainaut (province)|province of Hainaut]] after the fall of [[Napoleon]].\n\nThe church's predecessors, whose [[patron saint]] remains unknown, belonged to a [[parish]] of the old [[deanery]] of [[Fleurus]], part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|diocese of Li\u00e8ge]]. In 1559, during reforms of the episcopal hierarchy of the [[Low Countries]], this parish was first assigned to the newly created [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur|diocese of Namur]],<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> and later to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur|diocese of Tournai]] in the [[Concordat of 1801]].\n\n== The excavation of 1967 ==\nIn 1967, the church underwent a major restoration led by {{ill|Simon Brigode|fr}}, architect and professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|University of Leuven]]. During this restoration, [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s were conducted by {{ill|Luc-Francis Genicot|fr}}, [[assistant professor]] at the University of Leuven, from 16\u201322 August 1967.\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967 - tranch\u00e9es-en.svg|upright=1.5|alt=Layout of excavation|thumb|left|Layout of the August 1967 excavation]]\nThese excavations were conducted in a limited area which turned out to be of significance.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=9}}</ref> although the restoration work had already destroyed some of the ancient foundations.<ref name=\"gen18\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=18}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the current church had already profoundly modified the earlier site. The 18th-century flooring is lower than earlier levels; only the lowest levels of the old [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] still remained. During the excavations they found no foundation, no under-pavement, no lime mortar runoff, and no [[altar (Catholicism)|altar]] base.<ref name=\"gen18\"/> The sepulchre lay {{convert|19|cm|in}} under the current flooring level only.<ref name=\"gen19\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=19}}</ref>\n\nThe work done in the 19th and 20th centuries removed ancient traces. A thin brick gutter to hold [[gas lighting]] pipes was installed during the second half of the 19th century, cutting across the ''B'' trench.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=22}}</ref> An early 20th-century gutter, constructed roughly along the lengthwise axis of the current church, cut through the old foundations.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=20}}</ref>\n\nThese surveys made it possible to correctly locate the building's successive stages of growth.<ref name=\"gen19\"/>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n== The successive churches ==\nThree religious buildings that preceded the current church were uncovered during the excavations.\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967-en.svg|alt=|thumb|left|upright=2|Superimposed plans of churches 1, 3 and 4.]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n=== First church ===\n[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], the first building was formed of a rectangular chamber composed of a plain [[nave]] {{convert|4.7|m|yd}} wide, whose length the excavations did not manage to determine. It is possible that as in other small churches of the [[early Middle Ages]], the length of the church was double its width. This edifice may have been the church consecrated between 959 and 971 by Eraclus, abbot of [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]] and bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]], which was mentioned in the \"Eraclus charter\".<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=25}}</ref>\n\n=== Second church ===\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fouilles de 1967 - phase 2-en.svg|alt=|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Superimposed plans of churches 2 and 3.]]\nDuring the excavation, the only trace of the second church that was found is the foundation of an irregular three-sided [[apse]]. It is unclear how the building developed towards the [[narthex]]. We do know that this side ended with a tower because Jehan Camal, the local [[priest]], in his will of 1517, bequeathed 50 [[French livre|livres]] towards the repairing of the tower and the installation of a [[Church bell|bell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=102}}</ref> The tower is probably the same one that was mentioned in the 17th century and that was subsequently demolished for the construction of the 18th century church.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=30}}</ref> The size of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] suggests a three-apsed construction, maybe similar to the third church.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=27}}</ref> As well as the main altar, a [[Pouill\u00e9 (ecclesiastical register)|''Pouill\u00e9'']] ecclesiastical register from 1445 mentioned an altar devoted to [[Saint Nicholas]], and another from 1518 mentions an altar devoted to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=101}}</ref>\n\nNoting the similarities to the choir in Saint-Martin's church at [[Marcinelle]], rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, Luc-Francis Genicot hypothesised that it took inspiration from Jumet's earlier design, possibly from the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=28}}</ref>\n\nIn the choir lies a burial place containing a skeleton in a nailed oak coffin. The presence of embroidered cloth and the location suggests that it is the tomb of a priest, probably the local [[parson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n=== Third church ===\n[[File:Jumet_-_%C3%A9glise_Saint-Sulpice_-_fa%C3%A7ade_nord_-_fondations_des_%C3%A9difices_pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9dents.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Foundations of previous buildings]]\nThe choir of the third edifice probably dates back to the middle of the 17th century.<ref name=\"ref3\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=36}}</ref> This church is eight times bigger than the first. The choir is of a [[pentagon]]al design {{convert|8.25|m|yd}} deep. It is consolidated by four [[buttress]]es, suggesting that it was once covered by a solid [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], probably of [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] design. The nave, {{convert|22|m|yd}} long and of an estimated width of {{convert|20|m|yd}}, is slightly [[Trapezoid|trapezium]]-shaped<ref>Considering that the restitution is correct, because the south-west angle hasn't been maintained {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=30}}.</ref> and has two [[aisle]]s. The scale of the aisles lets us imagine a building of the [[hall church]] type, like many that existed in Hainault in the 15th and 16th century.\n\nThe tower stands against the church frontage. It underwent an important restoration in 1670 and a clock was installed in 1681. This bell-tower was probably square and roughly {{convert|6.4|m|yd}} long on each side. It was capped by an octagonal pointed spire, topped by a big [[finial]] cross and a weathercock reaching to {{convert|38|m|yd}} high.<ref name=\"ref1\" />\n\nIn 1710, the state of the church again called for serious repairs, and Jumet's [[bailiff]], Jean de Vigneron, asked the abbot of Lobbes, a big [[tithe]] collector, to build a new church. The abbey could not meet the expense.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=103}}</ref> Finally, after a lawsuit{{clarify|date=August 2017}}, an agreement was reached for the repairs to the church including the choir, the tower and the roof of the nave.<ref name=\"ref5\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Present church ===\n[[File:Jumet - \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice - Plan, coupes transversale et verticale, et \u00e9l\u00e9vation des fa\u00e7ades principale et lat\u00e9rale - feuille E - coup\u00e9e.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Section and elevation of the first draft of the 18th century with the old tower held (sheet ''E'').]]\nThe present church was built between 1750 and 1753 by an anonymous architect. The original plans consist of five coloured sheets.<ref>Kept at [[State Archives in Belgium]] {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}</ref> They have been numbered from ''A '' to ''E'' without any obvious order, probably after the completion of the construction. The ''C'' sheet did not belong to the first file, but the five drawings are from the same author. The ''E'' sheet has notes on the back where the name of ''D. De Lados'' appears twice, suggesting that it could be the name of the architect.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nBefore 1750, the old church was demolished and the ground levelled.<ref name=\"gen18\"/> This levelling is probably why the present church isn't correctly [[Orientation of churches|oriented]], unlike the original church, whose choir perfectly faced east.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=104}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - fa\u00e7ade nord - remploi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Details of materials reused in the current facing of the north facade.]]\nThe design was ambitious and excessive for the locals of the time. Tensions took place between the architect and the sponsors, including the abbot of Lobbes, Th\u00e9odulphe Barnab\u00e9 (abbot from 1728 to 1752).<ref name=\"ref5\" /> Construction lagged and, even though old materials were re-used in the base and the pavements,<ref name=\"ref3\" /> the cost was five times the original estimate : {{centered pull quote|We have been greatly wronged for the erection of this church[...]because the church building, instead of costing us twenty thousand [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s, is now costing us at least a hundred thousand [...] The architect has deceived us by increasing the length of the so-mentioned church by twenty-nine feet, and many other things|author=Complaint quoted by L-F. Genicot|source=<ref name=\"ref5\" />}}\n\nThe initial plan intended to re-integrate the old tower. An amendment definitely scrapped all the past.<ref name=\"ref3\" /> This project of a new tower probably belonged to that part of the ''many other things'' that were mentioned in the complaint.\n[[File:Jumet - \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice - Plan, coupes transversale et verticale, et \u00e9l\u00e9vation des fa\u00e7ades principale et lat\u00e9rale - feuille C.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century drawing of a proposed new facade (sheet'' C'')]]\nThis conflict ended with a trial before the Sovereign Council of Brabant. The architect was forced to reduce the scale of the project. This is evident by examining the successive frontage projects<ref name=\"ref6\" /> and comparing the size of the achieved high parts and the planned size on the original elevation drawing. The construction continued but with some delay. The church was finished in 1753.<ref name=\"ref3\" />\n\nThe steeple was designed to receive three bells. Two bells are attested, and there is no formal proof of the existence of the third.<ref name=\"ref8\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=104 ; 106}}</ref>\n\nOn the east side, a bell from 1590 is adorned with the image of the Virgin and has the inscription: ''Micael Willelmus coadiutor Lobiensis me fecit<ref>Michel Willame was co-helper from 1580 to 1598 of the abbey of Lobbes, Ermin Fran\u00e7ois, he was elected himself in 1598 and died in 1600 {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}.</ref> \u2013 1590 \u2013 Ma\u00eetre Jean Grongnart, founder''<ref name=\"ref8\" /><ref>Jean Grongnart belongs to a dynasty of founders that worked in Hainaut during the 16th and 17th century {{harv|Genicot|1969|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nOn the west side, the second bell was probably in bad shape because it was remelted in 1772, as the inscription attests : ''+ In the year 1772 I was remelted at the expense of the community of Jumet by Simon Chevresson and Deforest.''<ref name=\"ref8\" />\n\nIt's probable that the [[French revolution]] induced structural damage because a budget was allocated by the local administration for the repair of window panes and the roof in 1797.<ref name=\"ref9\">{{harvnb|Arcq|1973|p=105}}</ref> In 1808, three new altars were built.<ref name=\"ref7\">{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|p=41}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, the church underwent an important restoration. Part of the pavement was replaced, a new set of furniture was put in, the altars transformed<ref name=\"ref9\" /> and the master altar re-dedicated.<ref name=\"ref7\" />\n\nIn the brickwork of the master altar, removed during the 1968 restorations, a wooden [[reliquary]] casket with a glass lid was discovered. It contained two bones held together by a copper thread. Between them was a paper document in a very bad shape, nearly unreadable, dated 1835. Possibly that the reliquary is older than that and was put there when the altar was re-devoted.<ref>{{harvnb|Genicot|1969|pp=40\u201341}}</ref><ref>[http://balat.kikirpa.be/photo.php?path=B205941&objnr=10048113 Photography of the reliquary] on the website of the [[Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage]]</ref>\n\nIn 1840, a [[pipe organ]] was installed, the work of [[organ builder]] Hypolite Loret of [[Brussels]]. The instrument was upgraded in 1873.<ref name=\"ref9\" />\n\nIn 1943, German occupation authorities commandeered the bells. The 1590 bell was taken down and shipped to Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Maerten|Colignon|2012|pp=38\u201339}}</ref> After the [[Second World War|war]], it was found and re-installed in the steeple.<ref name=\"ref6\" /><ref>[http://balat.kikirpa.be/photo.php?path=A45010&objnr=10048181 Photograph of the bell] on the website of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage</ref>\n\n== Architecture and furniture ==\n[[File:\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice de Jumet - chevet.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|[[Chevet]] of the church.]]\nOf [[classic architecture|classic]] conception, the brick and [[limestone]] church is very homogeneous. It's composed of six [[bay (architecture)|bay]]ed [[nave]]s flanked by [[aisle]]s, a three-sided [[transept]] and a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] with a polygonal [[ambulatory]] with a [[sacristy]] in its axis. The [[chamfer]]ed [[Foundation (architecture)|base]] is in [[dimension stone]] on the frontage, in rubble stones and [[sandstone]] for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is [[Boss (architecture)|bossed]].{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n[[File:Jumet - \u00e9glise Saint-Sulpice - trois trav\u00e9es nord.jpg|thumb|upright|droite|alt=|Exterior elevation of the first three bays of north aisle.]]\nThe windows, except those of the tower, all have a gouged limestone frame cut with protruding teeth, with a curved arch and window aprons joined together by a limestone band going around the whole building. Similarly conceived half-windows are found on the second level in the background, under the [[cornice]].{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nThe frontage has two levels, with above them a curved [[pediment]]. On the first level, two belts proceed further than the central part to the side frontages under the [[volute]]d ailerons placed on both sides of the second level. Above the pediment, a square tower is made up of two stories separated by a belt. The tower has a polygonal steeple on a pyramidal base. The limestone portal is preceded by several steps. It's flanked by [[pilaster]]s with crosswalls that hold an [[entablature]] and a curved pediment. There is an arched door.{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nA secondary door, preceded by ten steps, is pierced by the first north aisle bay.\n\nThe interior is quite bright, painted in white and grey. It is covered by [[barrel vault]]s. The [[column]]s of the nave are of [[Tuscan order|tuscan]] style. The [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] of the choir and of the transept are crowned with a [[volute]]d [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s.{{sfn|PMDB|1994|p=126}}\n\nThe church contains noted [[panelling]] and furniture.<ref name=\"paysdecharleroi.be\">\n{{cite web |url= http://www.paysdecharleroi.be/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=157:patrimoine-religieux&id=203231:eglise-saint-suplice-%C3%A0-jumet&Itemid=716&lang=en |title= Saint-Suplice church in Jumet |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Le pays de Charleroi |publisher= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the church is a [[baptismal font]] from the 11th or 12th century. It consists of a stone bowl slightly flared but circular, flanked by four engaged columns on a base. The columns end with a roughly cut human head, of which two out of four are missing. The style is Romanesque and the font archaic: straight nose and barely cleared, skin-deep eyes, mouth expressionless. These details are characteristic of Romanesque workshops from the 11th and 12th centuries. However, the disposal of Jumet differs from other fonts known by the feature that the heads are borne directly by columns. Usually, the head is supported in cantilever by a kind of console, as is the case, for example, in [[Gerpinnes]].{{sfn|Brigode|1936|p=6-8}}\n\nThe furniture also contains an altar devoted to [[Basilica of Our Lady of Tongre|Our-Lady of Tongre]] and a [[communion bench]], both dating from the 17th century.<ref name=\"paysdecharleroi.be\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Jumet -
