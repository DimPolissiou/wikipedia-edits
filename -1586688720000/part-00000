Approximately 600&nbsp;mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the feces, although, as described below, much larger amounts are secreted, reabsorbed in the gut and recycled. The [[rate-limiting step]] in synthesis is the addition of a hydroxyl group of the 7th position of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme [[CYP7A1|cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase]]. This enzyme is down-regulated by cholic acid, up-regulated by cholesterol and is inhibited by the actions of the [[ileal]] [[hormone]] [[FGF15/19]].<ref name=pmid12543708/><ref name=pmid19346330/>\n\nPrior to secreting any of the bile acids (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate them with either [[glycine]] or [[taurine]], to form a total of 8 possible '''conjugated bile acids'''. These conjugated bile acids are often referred to as '''bile salts'''. The [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of the unconjugated bile acids are between 5 and 6.5,<ref name=Small /> and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated bile acids are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating bile acids with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated bile acids are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.<ref>'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007'</ref><ref name=\"pmid14097367\">{{cite journal |author=Hofmann AF |title=The function of bile salts in fat absorption.

They are partial dehydroxylated. Their glycine and taurine groups are removed to give the '''secondary bile acids''', [[deoxycholic acid]] and [[lithocholic acid]]. Cholic acid is converted into deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into lithocholic acid. All four of these bile acids recycled, in a process known as [[enterohepatic circulation]].<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n==Functions==\nAs [[amphipathic]] molecules with [[hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] regions, conjugated bile salts sit at the lipid/water interface and, at the right concentration, form [[micelles]].<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> The added solubility of conjugated bile salts aids in their function by preventing passive re-absorption in the small intestine. As a result, the concentration of bile acids/salts in the small intestine is high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids. \"Critical micellar concentration\" refers to both an intrinsic property of the bile acid itself and amount of bile acid necessary to function in the spontaneous and dynamic formation of micelles.<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> Bile acid-containing micelles aid [[lipases]] to digest lipids and bring them near the intestinal [[brush border]] membrane, which results in fat absorption.<ref name=\"pmid14162533\"/>\n\nSynthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800&nbsp;mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis producing 400\u2013600&nbsp;mg daily. Human adults secrete between 12-18&nbsp;g of bile acids into the intestine each day, mostly after meals. The bile acid pool size is between 4\u20136&nbsp;g, which means that bile acids are recycled several times each day. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed by [[active transport]] in the [[ileum]] and recycled back to the liver for further secretion into the biliary system and gallbladder. This [[enterohepatic circulation]] of bile acids allows a low rate of synthesis, only about 0.3g/day, but with large amounts being secreted into the intestine.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate certain catabolites (including [[bilirubin]]), emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, and aiding in motility and the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have metabolic actions in the body resembling those of [[hormones]], acting through two specific receptors, the [[farnesoid X receptor]] and [[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor]]/[[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor|TGR5]].<ref name=\"pmid19758712\"/><ref name=\"pmid25073467\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Chiang JY |title=Bile acid signaling in metabolic disease and drug therapy |journal=Pharmacol.

The D-ring is smaller by one carbon than the other three. The structure is commonly drawn with A at the left and D at the right.  The hydroxyl groups can be in either of two configurations: either up (or out), termed beta (\u03b2; often drawn by convention as a solid line), or down, termed alpha (\u03b1; displayed as a dashed line). All bile acids have a 3-hydroxyl group, derived from the parent molecule, cholesterol, in which the 3-hydroxyl is beta.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n[[Image:Steroid numbering.png|thumb|320px|[[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] recommended ring lettering (left) and atom numbering (right) of the steroid skeleton. The four rings A-D form a [[sterane]] core.]]\n\nThe initial step in the classical pathway of hepatic synthesis of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming [[7\u03b1-Hydroxycholesterol|7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol]]. This is then metabolised to [[7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one]]. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all.<ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/> These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the \u03b1 orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3\u03b1 and 7\u03b1.  This is 3\u03b1,7\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, [[chenodeoxycholic acid]]. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the \"[[Chen (genus)|cheno]]\" portion of the name was derived. The 5\u03b2 in the name denotes the orientation of the junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent). The term \"cholan\" denotes a particular steroid structure of 24 carbons, and the \"24-oic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid is found at position 24, at the end of the side-chain. Chenodeoxycholic acid is made by many species, and is the prototypic functional bile acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nAn alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis is initiated by [[mitochondrial]] sterol 27-hydroxylase ([[CYP27A1]]), expressed in liver, and also in macrophages and other tissues. CYP27A1 contributes significantly to total bile acid synthesis by catalyzing sterol side chain oxidation, after which cleavage of a three-carbon unit in the [[peroxisomes]] leads to formation of a C24 bile acid. Minor pathways initiated by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 24-hydroxylase in the brain also may contribute to bile acid synthesis. 7\u03b1-hydroxylase ([[CYP7B1]]) generates [[oxysterols]], which may be further converted in the liver to CDCA.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Cholic acid]], 3\u03b1,7\u03b1,12\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, the most abundant bile acid in humans and many other species, was discovered before chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a tri-hydroxy-bile acid with 3 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1, 7\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). In its synthesis in the liver, 12\u03b1 hydroxylation is performed by the additional action of [[CYP8B1]]. As this had already been described, the discovery of chenodeoxcholic acid (with 2 hydroxyl groups) made this new bile acid a \"deoxycholic acid\" in that it had one fewer hydroxyl group than cholic acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Deoxycholic acid]] is formed from cholic acid by 7-dehydroxylation, resulting in 2 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). This process with chenodeoxycholic acid results in a bile acid with only a 3\u03b1 hydroxyl group, termed [[lithocholic acid]] (litho = stone) having been identified first in a gallstone from a calf. It is poorly water-soluble and rather toxic to cells.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nDifferent vertebrate families have evolved to use modifications of most positions on the steroid nucleus and side-chain of the bile acid structure. To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most species add a third hydroxyl group to chenodeoxycholic acid. The subsequent removal of the 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will then result in a less toxic but still-functional dihydroxy bile acid. Over the course of vertebrate evolution, a number of positions have been chosen for placement of the third hydroxyl group. Initially, the 16\u03b1 position was favored, in particular in birds. Later, this position was superseded in a large number of species selecting the 12\u03b1 position. Primates (including humans) utilize 12\u03b1 for their third hydroxyl group position, producing cholic acid. In mice and other rodents, 6\u03b2 hydroxylation forms [[muricholic acid]]s (\u03b1 or \u03b2 depending on the 7 hydroxyl position). Pigs have 6\u03b1 hydroxylation in [[hyocholic acid]] (3\u03b1,6\u03b1,7\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholanoic acid), and other species have a hydroxyl group on position 23 of the side-chain.\n\n[[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] was first isolated from [[bear bile]], which has been used medicinally for centuries. Its structure resembles chenodeoxycholic acid but with the 7-hydroxyl group in the \u03b2 position.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n\n[[Obeticholic acid]], 6\u03b1-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, is a semi-synthetic bile acid with greater activity as FXR agonist which is undergoing investigation as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n==Hormonal actions==\nBile acids also act as steroid hormones, secreted from the liver, absorbed from the intestine and having various direct metabolic actions in the body through the nuclear receptor [[Farnesoid X receptor]] (FXR), also known by its gene name {{Gene|NR1H4}}.<ref name=\"pmid10334992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Makishima M, Okamoto AY, Repa JJ |title=Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1362\u20135 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334992 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1362|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10334993\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parks DJ, Blanchard SG, Bledsoe RK |title=Bile acids: natural ligands for an orphan nuclear receptor |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1365\u20138 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334993 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1365|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10360171\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Chen J, Hollister K, Sowers LC, Forman BM |title=Endogenous bile acids are ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR/BAR |journal=Mol.

Approximately 600&nbsp;mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the feces, although, as described below, much larger amounts are secreted, reabsorbed in the gut and recycled. The [[rate-limiting step]] in synthesis is the addition of a hydroxyl group of the 7th position of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme [[CYP7A1|cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase]]. This enzyme is down-regulated by cholic acid, up-regulated by cholesterol and is inhibited by the actions of the [[ileal]] [[hormone]] [[FGF15/19]].<ref name=pmid12543708/><ref name=pmid19346330/>\n\nPrior to secreting any of the bile acids (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate them with either [[glycine]] or [[taurine]], to form a total of 8 possible '''conjugated bile acids'''. These conjugated bile acids are often referred to as '''bile salts'''. The [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of the unconjugated bile acids are between 5 and 6.5,<ref name=Small /> and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated bile acids are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating bile acids with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated bile acids are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.<ref>'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007'</ref><ref name=\"pmid14097367\">{{cite journal |author=Hofmann AF |title=The function of bile salts in fat absorption.

They are partial dehydroxylated. Their glycine and taurine groups are removed to give the '''secondary bile acids''', [[deoxycholic acid]] and [[lithocholic acid]]. Cholic acid is converted into deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into lithocholic acid.

As a result, the concentration of bile acids/salts in the small intestine is high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids. \"Critical micellar concentration\" refers to both an intrinsic property of the bile acid itself and amount of bile acid necessary to function in the spontaneous and dynamic formation of micelles.<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> Bile acid-containing micelles aid [[lipases]] to digest lipids and bring them near the intestinal [[brush border]] membrane, which results in fat absorption.<ref name=\"pmid14162533\"/>\n\nSynthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800&nbsp;mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis producing 400\u2013600&nbsp;mg daily. Human adults secrete between 12-18&nbsp;g of bile acids into the intestine each day, mostly after meals. The bile acid pool size is between 4\u20136&nbsp;g, which means that bile acids are recycled several times each day. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed by [[active transport]] in the [[ileum]] and recycled back to the liver for further secretion into the biliary system and gallbladder. This [[enterohepatic circulation]] of bile acids allows a low rate of synthesis, only about 0.3g/day, but with large amounts being secreted into the intestine.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate certain catabolites (including [[bilirubin]]), emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, and aiding in motility and the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have metabolic actions in the body resembling those of [[hormones]], acting through two specific receptors, the [[farnesoid X receptor]] and [[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor]]/[[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor|TGR5]].<ref name=\"pmid19758712\"/><ref name=\"pmid25073467\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Chiang JY |title=Bile acid signaling in metabolic disease and drug therapy |journal=Pharmacol.

The D-ring is smaller by one carbon than the other three. The structure is commonly drawn with A at the left and D at the right.  The hydroxyl groups can be in either of two configurations: either up (or out), termed beta (\u03b2; often drawn by convention as a solid line), or down, termed alpha (\u03b1; displayed as a dashed line). All bile acids have a 3-hydroxyl group, derived from the parent molecule, cholesterol, in which the 3-hydroxyl is beta.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n[[Image:Steroid numbering.png|thumb|320px|[[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] recommended ring lettering (left) and atom numbering (right) of the steroid skeleton. The four rings A-D form a [[sterane]] core.]]\n\nThe initial step in the classical pathway of hepatic synthesis of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming [[7\u03b1-Hydroxycholesterol|7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol]]. This is then metabolised to [[7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one]]. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all.<ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/> These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the \u03b1 orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3\u03b1 and 7\u03b1.  This is 3\u03b1,7\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, [[chenodeoxycholic acid]]. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the \"[[Chen (genus)|cheno]]\" portion of the name was derived. The 5\u03b2 in the name denotes the orientation of the junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent). The term \"cholan\" denotes a particular steroid structure of 24 carbons, and the \"24-oic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid is found at position 24, at the end of the side-chain. Chenodeoxycholic acid is made by many species, and is the prototypic functional bile acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nAn alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis is initiated by [[mitochondrial]] sterol 27-hydroxylase ([[CYP27A1]]), expressed in liver, and also in macrophages and other tissues. CYP27A1 contributes significantly to total bile acid synthesis by catalyzing sterol side chain oxidation, after which cleavage of a three-carbon unit in the [[peroxisomes]] leads to formation of a C24 bile acid. Minor pathways initiated by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 24-hydroxylase in the brain also may contribute to bile acid synthesis. 7\u03b1-hydroxylase ([[CYP7B1]]) generates [[oxysterols]], which may be further converted in the liver to CDCA.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Cholic acid]], 3\u03b1,7\u03b1,12\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, the most abundant bile acid in humans and many other species, was discovered before chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a tri-hydroxy-bile acid with 3 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1, 7\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). In its synthesis in the liver, 12\u03b1 hydroxylation is performed by the additional action of [[CYP8B1]]. As this had already been described, the discovery of chenodeoxcholic acid (with 2 hydroxyl groups) made this new bile acid a \"deoxycholic acid\" in that it had one fewer hydroxyl group than cholic acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Deoxycholic acid]] is formed from cholic acid by 7-dehydroxylation, resulting in 2 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). This process with chenodeoxycholic acid results in a bile acid with only a 3\u03b1 hydroxyl group, termed [[lithocholic acid]] (litho = stone) having been identified first in a gallstone from a calf. It is poorly water-soluble and rather toxic to cells.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nDifferent vertebrate families have evolved to use modifications of most positions on the steroid nucleus and side-chain of the bile acid structure. To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most species add a third hydroxyl group to chenodeoxycholic acid. The subsequent removal of the 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will then result in a less toxic but still-functional dihydroxy bile acid. Over the course of vertebrate evolution, a number of positions have been chosen for placement of the third hydroxyl group. Initially, the 16\u03b1 position was favored, in particular in birds. Later, this position was superseded in a large number of species selecting the 12\u03b1 position. Primates (including humans) utilize 12\u03b1 for their third hydroxyl group position, producing cholic acid. In mice and other rodents, 6\u03b2 hydroxylation forms [[muricholic acid]]s (\u03b1 or \u03b2 depending on the 7 hydroxyl position). Pigs have 6\u03b1 hydroxylation in [[hyocholic acid]] (3\u03b1,6\u03b1,7\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholanoic acid), and other species have a hydroxyl group on position 23 of the side-chain.\n\n[[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] was first isolated from [[bear bile]], which has been used medicinally for centuries. Its structure resembles chenodeoxycholic acid but with the 7-hydroxyl group in the \u03b2 position.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n\n[[Obeticholic acid]], 6\u03b1-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, is a semi-synthetic bile acid with greater activity as FXR agonist which is undergoing investigation as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n==Hormonal actions==\nBile acids also act as steroid hormones, secreted from the liver, absorbed from the intestine and having various direct metabolic actions in the body through the nuclear receptor [[Farnesoid X receptor]] (FXR), also known by its gene name {{Gene|NR1H4}}.<ref name=\"pmid10334992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Makishima M, Okamoto AY, Repa JJ |title=Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1362\u20135 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334992 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1362|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10334993\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parks DJ, Blanchard SG, Bledsoe RK |title=Bile acids: natural ligands for an orphan nuclear receptor |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1365\u20138 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334993 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1365|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10360171\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Chen J, Hollister K, Sowers LC, Forman BM |title=Endogenous bile acids are ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR/BAR |journal=Mol.

The [[simulcast]] is presented live, originally from the [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] before moving to [[MediaCityUK]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/bbcbreakfast/|title=BBC Breakfast \u2013 About the BBC|accessdate=10 December 2018}}</ref> in 2012. The programme contains a mixture of news, sport, weather, business, and feature items and is broadcast 365 days a year.\n\n==Pre-''BBC Breakfast'' history==\n''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'' was the first [[BBC]] breakfast programme, with [[Ron Neil]] as producer. It was conceived in response to the plans of the [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] company [[TV-am]] to introduce a breakfast television show. ''Breakfast Time'''s first broadcast was on 17 January 1983<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05v9rk0|title=Breakfast Time 1983 \u2013 History of the BBC|accessdate=10 December 2018}}</ref> and was presented by [[Frank Bough]], [[Selina Scott]], [[Nick Ross]] and [[Russell Grant]]. The atmosphere of the set was intended to encourage a relaxed informality; a set that mimicked a living-room rather than a studio, with red leather sofas, and Bough and Ross wearing jumpers and open-necked shirts.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/apr/09/the-battle-for-britains-breakfast-the-call-centre-tv-review|title=''The Battle for Britain's Breakfast; The Call Centre \u2013 TV review'' \u2013 The Guardian Dowling.T p.9 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014|last1=Dowling|first1=Tim}}</ref> ''Breakfast Time'' lasted 150 minutes, initially being transmitted between 6.30 am and 9 am, before moving to a 6.50 am to 9.20 am slot on 18 February 1985.\n\nRon Neil, the programme's first editor,<ref>See for example: Ian Jones, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpQ_esoMKLMC&pg=PA17 Morning Glory: A history of British breakfast television]''.

The programme had been planned to start in September but was postponed due to delays with the set. The first edition was presented by [[Nicholas Witchell]] and [[Jill Dando]].<ref name=tvnewsroom>{{cite web|url=https://tvnewsroom.org/bbc-breakfast/bbc-breakfast-through-the-years-1986-2018-189681/|title=BBC Breakfast through the years \u2013 tvnewsroom|accessdate=10 December 2018|date=24 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1993, both programmes moved to the then sixth floor N2 studio in a set used for the One, Six and Nine o'clock news.<ref name=tvnewsroom/> Composer [[George Fenton]] reworked the theme tune for the Silicon Graphics CGI, title sequences were designed in-house by the BBC and the set was built by Television Production Design Ltd. The business news coverage extended to an hour-long programme in its own right, beginning at 6 am, while ''Breakfast News'' started at 7 am. A further revamp occurred in June 1997 when the programme was renamed as simply ''Breakfast News''.<ref name=tvnewsroom/>\n\n==''BBC Breakfast'' history==\n\nOn 2 October 2000 the merging of separate breakfast programmes of [[BBC One]] and [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] into one single simulcast called ''BBC Breakfast'' started, with the first show hosted by [[Sophie Raworth]] and [[Jeremy Bowen]].<ref name=tvnewsroom/> The studio was replaced with a new set in 2003.\n\nSince April 2006, the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] channel has returned to its traditional format from 8.30 am while ''Breakfast'' continues on BBC One until 9.15 am. In April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed \"BBC News\", as part of a \u00a3550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation.\n\nOn 2 May 2006, ''Breakfast'' moved into studio [[BBC Television Centre|N6 at Television Centre]] with other BBC One news programmes that required a larger set design that included walls of [[Barco video screen]]s. The original screen scenes of<ref name=tvnewsroom/> cirrus clouds on a blue sky were changed as a result of viewer comments that 'it looked too cold'\u2014their replacement was with orange squares of the same design as those appearing in the programme's new title sequence, which were designed to hide any joins or faults between the screens which had previously been obvious. The screens eventually displayed visuals needed for story content: different backgrounds, graphics and still photographs. More importantly, the set had a generic visual style that could be used for other programmes, such as the national news bulletins, without much additional physical change. The programme celebrated its 20th anniversary on 17 January 2003.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/2665859.stm 20 years of breakfast television] BBC News, 17 January 2003</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2008, ''Breakfast'' returned to the [[Television Centre, London|TC7 studios]], where ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'' had been based following its move from the BBC Lime Grove Studios. On 2 March 2009, ''Breakfast'' relaunched with a new set and studio background.<ref name=tvnewsroom/> The backdrop resembled that of the [[BBC News]] channel as did the new ''Breakfast'' titles.

[[Louise Minchin]] would, with the studio move to [[City of Salford|Salford]], join the other main presenters of BBC ''Breakfast'': [[Bill Turnbull]], [[Susanna Reid]] and [[Charlie Stayt]]. [[Carol Kirkwood]], on 26 March 2012, would remain in London presenting weather.

During the games, former presenters [[Sian Williams]] and [[Chris Hollins]] also returned to lead the morning programme, in addition to [[Bill Turnbull]] and [[BBC Sport]] presenter [[Hazel Irvine]]. The show ended its temporary London return with broadcasting from the BBC News Channel's studio on the morning following the closing ceremonies before rebroadcasting from Salford the next day.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, ''BBC Breakfast'' updated its \"lower thirds\" to match the graphics and fonts used by the rest of BBC News since the previous day. The clock was consequently moved to the lower right side of the screen.\n\nOn 23 July 2014, the show went on location again, this time to [[Glasgow]] to showcase highlights from the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]. In the hours leading up to the opening ceremony, [[Carol Kirkwood]] reported from [[Celtic Park]].\n\nFor the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] the programme was again renamed ''Olympic Breakfast'' and would be anchored from Salford and Rio.\n\n==Format==\nBetween 06:00 and 08:30 on weekdays, the programme is simulcast on [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]]. During the simulcast, the sports news is at 06:10, 06:35, 07:35 and 08:35. In addition, live sports bulletins are broadcast from sporting locations, such as [[Royal Ascot]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], with the presenter interviewing key sporting figures. Business updates are presented at 06:10, when the main business stories from the newspapers are also discussed, and then at 20 minutes and 50 minutes past the hour, either from the studio, or out on location. The United Kingdom weather forecast is at 15 minutes and 45 minutes past the hour throughout the programme, either from the BBC Weather Centre in [[Broadcasting House]], or out on location. Short (approximately four minutes) regional news, travel and weather bulletins are done just before the hour and the half-hour throughout the programme. Once the BBC News Channel breaks away for its own programming (starting from ''[[Business Live]]'') at 08:30, a brief check of the headlines, and sports are done then the show gradually shifts to reporting lifestyle and entertainment-oriented stories. The show occasionally ends with a musical performance from one of the guests.\n\nThe show is abbreviated during bank holidays to just three hours but still features regional news updates, and is completely simulcast on the BBC News Channel.\n\nDuring weekends, there are no updates from regional news bureaus. The first and/or second hour of the weekend edition may occasionally feature abbreviated versions of the BBC's other programmes such as ''Click'', ''Reporters'' (shown in full at 6:30 on Sundays), ''The Travel Show'' and the ''Film Review''. They also have a paper review with guests, and [[Paul Lewis (broadcaster)|Paul Lewis]] normally discusses business or personal finance news. The show is also simulcast on BBC One and the BBC News Channel but BBC One occasionally breaks away   on Sundays to show the previous night's edition of ''[[Match of the Day]]''.\n\n== Interactive ==\n''Breakfast'' encourages viewer response and interaction via [[e-mail]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/8772778.stm Contact us] BBC News, 29 June 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v5tb/faq Contact us] BBC News, 28 May 2010</ref> Video reports and interviews from the programme are made available on the ''Breakfast'' Facebook page after transmission.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Naga Munchetty, Trump comments ===\nIn September 2019, Munchetty was ruled to have breached the BBC's guidelines by criticising US President [[Donald Trump]] for [[Racial views of Donald Trump|perceived racism]]. That July, while presenting ''BBC Breakfast'', Munchetty had taken issue with Trump's comments telling his opponents to \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came\". Munchetty said: \"Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.

The programme had been planned to start in September but was postponed due to delays with the set. The first edition was presented by [[Nicholas Witchell]] and [[Jill Dando]].<ref name=tvnewsroom>{{cite web|url=https://tvnewsroom.org/bbc-breakfast/bbc-breakfast-through-the-years-1986-2018-189681/|title=BBC Breakfast through the years \u2013 tvnewsroom|accessdate=10 December 2018|date=24 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1993, both programmes moved to the then sixth floor N2 studio in a set used for the One, Six and Nine o'clock news.<ref name=tvnewsroom/> Composer [[George Fenton]] reworked the theme tune for the Silicon Graphics CGI, title sequences were designed in-house by the BBC and the set was built by Television Production Design Ltd. The business news coverage extended to an hour-long programme in its own right, beginning at 6 am, while ''Breakfast News'' started at 7 am. A further revamp occurred in June 1997 when the programme was renamed as simply ''Breakfast News''.<ref name=tvnewsroom/>\n\n==''BBC Breakfast'' history==\n\nOn 2 October 2000 the merging of separate breakfast programmes of [[BBC One]] and [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] into one single simulcast called ''BBC Breakfast'' started, with the first show hosted by [[Sophie Raworth]] and [[Jeremy Bowen]].<ref name=tvnewsroom/> The studio was replaced with a new set in 2003.\n\nSince April 2006, the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] channel has returned to its traditional format from 8.30 am while ''Breakfast'' continues on BBC One until 9.15 am. In April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed \"BBC News\", as part of a \u00a3550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation.\n\nOn 2 May 2006, ''Breakfast'' moved into studio [[BBC Television Centre|N6 at Television Centre]] with other BBC One news programmes that required a larger set design that included walls of [[Barco video screen]]s. The original screen scenes of<ref name=tvnewsroom/> cirrus clouds on a blue sky were changed as a result of viewer comments that 'it looked too cold'\u2014their replacement was with orange squares of the same design as those appearing in the programme's new title sequence, which were designed to hide any joins or faults between the screens which had previously been obvious. The screens eventually displayed visuals needed for story content: different backgrounds, graphics and still photographs. More importantly, the set had a generic visual style that could be used for other programmes, such as the national news bulletins, without much additional physical change. The programme celebrated its 20th anniversary on 17 January 2003.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/2665859.stm 20 years of breakfast television] BBC News, 17 January 2003</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2008, ''Breakfast'' returned to the [[Television Centre, London|TC7 studios]], where ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'' had been based following its move from the BBC Lime Grove Studios. On 2 March 2009, ''Breakfast'' relaunched with a new set and studio background.<ref name=tvnewsroom/> The backdrop resembled that of the [[BBC News]] channel as did the new ''Breakfast'' titles.

During the games, former presenters [[Sian Williams]] and [[Chris Hollins]] also returned to lead the morning programme, in addition to [[Bill Turnbull]] and [[BBC Sport]] presenter [[Hazel Irvine]]. The show ended its temporary London return with broadcasting from the BBC News Channel's studio on the morning following the closing ceremonies before rebroadcasting from Salford the next day.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, ''BBC Breakfast'' updated its \"lower thirds\" to match the graphics and fonts used by the rest of BBC News since the previous day. The clock was consequently moved to the lower right side of the screen.\n\nOn 23 July 2014, the show went on location again, this time to [[Glasgow]] to showcase highlights from the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]. In the hours leading up to the opening ceremony, [[Carol Kirkwood]] reported from [[Celtic Park]].\n\nFor the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] the programme was again renamed ''Olympic Breakfast'' and would be anchored from Salford and Rio.\n\n==Format==\nBetween 06:00 and 08:30 on weekdays, the programme is simulcast on [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]]. During the simulcast, the sports news is at 06:10, 06:35, 07:35 and 08:35. In addition, live sports bulletins are broadcast from sporting locations, such as [[Royal Ascot]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], with the presenter interviewing key sporting figures. Business updates are presented at 06:10, when the main business stories from the newspapers are also discussed, and then at 20 minutes and 50 minutes past the hour, either from the studio, or out on location. The United Kingdom weather forecast is at 15 minutes and 45 minutes past the hour throughout the programme, either from the BBC Weather Centre in [[Broadcasting House]], or out on location. Short (approximately four minutes) regional news, travel and weather bulletins are done just before the hour and the half-hour throughout the programme. Once the BBC News Channel breaks away for its own programming (starting from ''[[Business Live]]'') at 08:30, a brief check of the headlines, and sports are done then the show gradually shifts to reporting lifestyle and entertainment-oriented stories. The show occasionally ends with a musical performance from one of the guests.\n\nThe show is abbreviated during bank holidays to just three hours but still features regional news updates, and is completely simulcast on the BBC News Channel.\n\nDuring weekends, there are no updates from regional news bureaus. The first and/or second hour of the weekend edition may occasionally feature abbreviated versions of the BBC's other programmes such as ''Click'', ''Reporters'' (shown in full at 6:30 on Sundays), ''The Travel Show'' and the ''Film Review''. They also have a paper review with guests, and [[Paul Lewis (broadcaster)|Paul Lewis]] normally discusses business or personal finance news. The show is also simulcast on BBC One and the BBC News Channel but BBC One occasionally breaks away   on Sundays to show the previous night's edition of ''[[Match of the Day]]''.\n\n== Interactive ==\n''Breakfast'' encourages viewer response and interaction via [[e-mail]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/8772778.stm Contact us] BBC News, 29 June 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v5tb/faq Contact us] BBC News, 28 May 2010</ref> Video reports and interviews from the programme are made available on the ''Breakfast'' Facebook page after transmission.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Naga Munchetty, Trump comments ===\nIn September 2019, Munchetty was ruled to have breached the BBC's guidelines by criticising US President [[Donald Trump]] for [[Racial views of Donald Trump|perceived racism]].

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family. The Tichacek's temporarily lived in Mysl\u00edv where one of their sons Alois was born in 1857. Shortly afterwards, they also moved to St. Louis. Immigration slowed for a time in the 1860's because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]].\n\nMany of those who settled in Baltimore were participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

Then she graduated from the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague, majoring in the history of art. She was awarded the diploma of the candidate of sciences, for her dissertation Czech Engaged Graphics 1917 - 1927, in 1989. She is rich in her professional activities in the field of 20th century art (especially graphics and book illustrations). and documentation of the Union of Czechoslovakia. also as an editor of Evening Prague. From 1986 to 1991 she was a member of the jury of the Most Beautiful Book of Czechoslovakia. Since 1990 she has been a member of the Scientific Council of the Terez\u00edn Memorial. Her curatorial and publishing activities are also rich. She is also the author of numerous newspaper and magazine articles. In 1986 she was awarded the prize of the Union of Czech Artists for two contributions in the field of book and illustration, two commemorative medals of the Terez\u00edn Memorial and in 2007 she received the V\u00e1clav Hollar Medal.\n\nFranti\u0161ek Wawre\u010dka (1920) - soldier\n\nMr. Franti\u0161ek Wawre\u010dka was born on 3 April 1920 in Ostrava - Z\u00e1b\u0159eh as the third of five children. He spent his childhood in Z\u00e1b\u0159eh, and for many years he moved to V\u00edtkovice with his parents. He trained as a modeller and worked in V\u00edtkovice Ironworks.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, the war was coming and Mr. Franti\u0161ek Wawre\u010dka and his friend decided to go to Poland, where the military group of General Ludv\u00edk Svoboda was formed. Their journey led through Poland to the Soviet Union through Moscow and Odessa, the ship sailed through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and through Istanbul further to the Middle East to Palestine to General Klap\u00e1lek. As members of the Infantry Battalion, they were sent by the Western Desert to occupied Tobruk Fortress in Libya. Here he spent almost three years of war hardship with various movements along the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIn 1942 they were retrained to an anti-aircraft regiment and temporarily anchored in Palestinian Haifa as an airport defense. In 1943 they circumnavigated the African continent to England, where Mr. Wawre\u010dka took a course for drivers and became a member of the motorized battalion. In 1944 they besieged French Dunkirk and remained there until the end of the war. Mr. Wawre\u010dka returned to his native country - Czechoslovakia after a long six-year period.\n\nHe also met his future wife Helena Sporkov\u00e1 in Mysl\u00edva, whom he married in the autumn of 1945. They went to Ostrava for a short time, where their son Vladim\u00edr was born. Since Mrs. Helena Wawre\u010dkov\u00e1's father was left alone in Myself, everyone returned. From 1947, Mr. Wawre\u010dka began working in Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 \u0160koda as a wood-modeler with whom he was trained. He remained faithful to this job until 1970, when he retired.\n\nFor his courage and bravery, which Mr. Wawre\u010dka showed by going abroad, he received many awards and honors such as Czechoslovak War Cross, Polish War Cross, Medal of Valor, Medal for Defense of Poland, African Star of the Eighth Brigade, Award 1939-45, Star for Participation in war, Medal of Merit, for the fight against fascism, commemorative medals and many others. At the end of 2005, Mr. Wawre\u010dka was awarded the highest French Order of the Legion of Honor and was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 2006 he was solemnly named Honorary Citizen of Mysl\u00edv Municipality.\n\nStanislav Kub\u00edk (1930) - researcher\n\nProfessor, ing. Stanislav Kub\u00edk, doctor of technical sciences, full member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, was born November 15, 1930 in the family blacksmith village Mysl\u00edva. He attended elementary school in Mysl\u00edva, the Secondary School in Nepomuk and the Industrial School in Pilsen. He obtained his engineering degree at the University of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (V\u0160SE) in Pilsen, then he completed his scientific studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague. He is one of the founders of the field of technical cybernetics in Czechoslovakia and the main builder of this field at V\u0160SE in Pilsen. He worked as the head of the Department of Technical Cybernetics and was the Rector of the University of Economics in Pilsen. After leaving the University of Economics, he was the director of the Institute of Information Theory and Automation of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (\u010cSAV), the scientific secretary of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and then the vice-chairman of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe achieved the most important professional results in the field of analysis and synthesis of nonlinear dynamic systems. He is the author and co-author of many scientific and professional articles and treatises published in Czech and foreign journals and conferences, twelve monographs published in Czechoslovakia and abroad, and research reports resulting from cooperation with industrial and research organizations.\n\nMarta's wife is an electrical engineer.

A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.\n\nThe inherently philosophical idea has also become a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the \"disembodied\" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.\n\nNo such procedure in humans has ever been reported by a research paper in a scholarly journal, or other reliable source. Also, the ability to send external electric signals to the brain of a sort that the brain can interpret, and the ability to communicate thoughts or perceptions to any external entity by wire, is, except for very basic commands, well beyond current (2017) technology.\n\n== Grown ==\nIn 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf made an \"adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |title=Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'' |access-date=2009-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042943/http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily. 22 October 2004.</ref>\n\nTeams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body.

A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.\n\nThe inherently philosophical idea has also become a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the \"disembodied\" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.\n\nNo such procedure in humans has ever been reported by a research paper in a scholarly journal, or other reliable source. Also, the ability to send external electric signals to the brain of a sort that the brain can interpret, and the ability to communicate thoughts or perceptions to any external entity by wire, is, except for very basic commands, well beyond current (2017) technology.\n\n== Grown ==\nIn 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf made an \"adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |title=Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'' |access-date=2009-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042943/http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily. 22 October 2004.</ref>\n\nTeams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body.

After his death Dowell himself becomes a subject of such an experiment.\n*The [[Mi-go]] aliens in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], first appearing in the story \"[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]\" (1931), can transport humans from Earth to [[Pluto]] (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's brain and placing it into a \"brain cylinder\", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.\n*In [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s ''[[Captain Future]]'' novels series (1940), the character Prof. Simon Wright is a human brain living in a transparent case.\n*In ''[[Donovan's Brain]]'' (see term), the 1942 science fiction novel by [[Curt Siodmak]] (filmed three times in different versions: 1944, 1953 and 1962), the brain of a ruthless millionaire is kept alive in a tank where it grows to monstrous proportions and powers.\n*The final novel in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s \"[[Space Trilogy]]\", ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945), uses the isolated brain of Francois Alcasan, an Algerian radiologist guillotined for murder, as a plot device. At some point in the novel, it is revealed that Alcasan's artificially-perfused head is used to allow evil intelligence to communicate with humans directly.\n*In [[Roald Dahl]]'s short story \"[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]\" (1960), after William's death his brain is kept alive on an artificial heart.<ref name=vice1/>\n*In [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' (1963), the character [[A Wrinkle in Time#IT|IT]] is a disembodied telepathic brain that dominates the planet of Camazotz.\n*The [[Humans as Gods#Ruinators|Ruinators]], later known as the Demiurges, are the immensely cyborgized alien society in ''[[Humans as Gods]]'', the 1966\u20131977 sci-fi trilogy by [[Sergey Snegov]]. They use the isolated brains of the highly intelligent species [[Humans as Gods#Galaxians|Galaxians]] as the organic supercomputers in charge of the [[Humans as Gods#Metrics Stations|Metrics Stations]], the primary and most secret military defense structure of the Ruinators' Empire. The brains are being extracted from the prisoners' babies and grown artificially in the spheres filled with the nutrient liquid. Among the most important characters of the second and third novels comes the [[Humans as Gods#Vagrant|Brain of the Third Planet]], later known as [[Vagrant]] or Voice, who has somehow developed self-consciousness and later rebelled against the Ruinators. Due to the Vagrant's fervent desire for a life of those embodied, the Brain has been surgically put into a dragon's body, whose inherent brain was destroyed in a recent battle. Vagrant enjoyed a sentient dragon's life for a few decades after that, until the body grew too senile, and on the threshold of the dragon's death the brain was removed again to assume control over a starship.<ref name=vice1/>\n*In the 1971 novel ''[[Gray Matters (novel)|Gray Matters]]'' by [[William Hjortsberg]], the protagonist and his acquaintances are all disembodied brains, preserved underground after a nuclear war.\n*In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' prequel trilogy to the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[cymek]]s are disembodied brains that wear robotic bodies.\n*In [[P. C. Jersild]] novel ''[[A Living Soul]]'' a human brain is living in an aquarium, and is a subject of medical experiments\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:Brainthatwouldntdie film poster.jpg|thumb|A monstrous brain in a jar, in a poster for ''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'']]\n\n*Isolated brains also appeared in ''[[Star Trek]]''.  In the episode \"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]\", the Providers are disembodied brains that kidnap individuals in order to force them to fight against each other.  Later, in the episode \"[[Spock's Brain]]\", [[Spock|Mr. Spock's]] brain is removed by a native of the Sigma Draconis system in order to serve as the Eymorg Controller. Due to Vulcan physiology, Spock's body remains alive. The crew of the ''Enterprise'' follow an ion trail to Sigma Draconis VI where, using the knowledge of the Eymorg, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] is able to restore Spock's brain to his body.\n*Isolated brains also appear in ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''.  In the episode \"[[The Night of the Druid's Blood]]\", one of [[James West's]] old tutors is killed and West discovers that it is Dr Tristam who has removed the brains from the bodies and is forcing them to work for him.  Finally West manages to communicate to the isolated brains that if they all work together they can destroy Dr Tristam and have peace.\n*In the 1970s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', Solon, an authority on micro-surgical techniques, transplants Morbius's brain into an artificial translucent brain cylinder casing.  Additionally, in the modern ''Doctor Who'' series (2005\u2013present), the recurring antagonists known as the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] are presented as human brains (in [[The Pandorica Opens|one instance]], an entire human head) encased in mechanical exoskeletons, connected by an artificial nervous system; this is ostensibly done as an \"upgrade\" from the comparatively fragile human body to a far more durable and longer-lasting shell. Another group of modern ''Doctor Who'' foes, the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Toclafane|Toclafane]], were revealed to be human heads encased in flying, weaponized spheres, the final forms of humans from the far future who turned to desperate measures in order to survive the conditions of the impending [[heat death of the universe]].\n*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\" and \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\", [[Cassandra (Doctor Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is an isolated brain attached to a canvas of skin with a face.\n*The mad scientist in the French film ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' has a \"brain in a vat\" for a companion.\n*In ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', the brain, eyes, and much of the nervous system of the Detroit drug lord Cain is harvested by OCP officials to use in their plans for an upgraded \"RoboCop 2\" [[cyborg]]. These systems are stored in a vat shortly after the surgery, where the disembodied Cain can still see the remains of his former body being discarded before being placed into the fitted robotic skeleton.\n*[[Observer (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Observer]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' carries his brain in a [[Petri dish]].\n*In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in \"[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]\") and also apparently [[Dick Clark]] of [[Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve]] fame still doing the countdown in the year 2999, has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show. In \"[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]\" the Big Brain, an isolated brain and leader of the Brainspawn, is outwitted by Fry. The brain's disciples have been attempting to dumb down every lifeform they meet to enable them to steal all the universe's data and hoard it in the infosphere.<ref name=vice1/>\n* In the animated series ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', the main character Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach in two jars. Both of them are able to move and talk, even without jars. Hector's brain sometimes controls the bear Boskov while Hector's stomach digests parts of Boskov's food.\n*The [[science fantasy]] [[television series]] ''[[LEXX]]'' includes a robot head containing human brain tissue. Also whenever the current Divine Shadow body dies his brain is removed and placed in a device that allows him to speak and kept with rest of the Divine Predecessors.\n*In the movie ''[[Blood Diner]]'', two cannibal brothers bring their uncle's (isolated) brain back to life to help them in their quest to restore life to the five-million-year-old goddess Shitaar. Their uncle's brain instructs them to collect the required parts to resurrecting Shitaar \u2013 virgins, assorted body parts, and the ingredients for a \"blood buffet\".\n*In the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', the [[protagonist]], a pioneering [[neurosurgeon]], falls in love with a disembodied brain that was able to communicate with him [[Telepathy|telepathically]].\n*''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode \"[[The Brain of Colonel Barham]]\" details the story of a dying [[astronaut]], Colonel Barham. It is decided to separate his brain from his body and keep it alive, with neural implants connecting it to visual and audio input/output for the mission. But without a body, the brain becomes extremely powerful and megalomaniacal.\n* The 2011 web series ''[[The Mercury Men]]'' features a brain in a jar<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weprin|first1=Alex|title=Syfy Picks Up Original Web Series 'The Mercury Men'|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/syfy-picks-up-original-web-series-the-mercury-men/12549|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=21 January 2011}}</ref> (\"The Battery\") that can communicate telepathically and over a walkie-talkie-like devices and is revealed to control the \"mercury men\" for a catastrophic plan to destroy Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mercury Men Are Here|url=http://www.needcoffee.com/2011/09/12/mercury-men/|website=needcoffee.com|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=2011-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Randy|title=The Mercury Men|url=http://www.fanfilmfollies.com/featured/the-mercury-men|website=fanfilmfollies.com|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=2012-02-03}}</ref>\n*The [[List of Wonder Woman episodes#Season 3 (1978\u201379)|Wonder Woman]] episode \"Gault's Brain\" features the classic \"brain in a vat\".\n\n=== Comics ===\n* ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #62 (Dec. 1940) had the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] battle a human brain in a vat that had developed enormous powers and become mobile and sprouted an arm.\n* [[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] Annual #1 (1987) had the inhabitants of Trudeau, [[South Dakota]], reduced to disembodied brains by the [[Word-Bringer]].\n\n===Anime and manga===\n* Many people in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime franchise possess [[cyberbrain]]s, which can sustain a modified human brain within a cybernetic body indefinitely.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'']] series of games, isolated brains are used to control robots called \"Robobrains\".<ref name=vice1>{{cite web|title=The Top 5 Fictional Characters That Are Literally Just Brains|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-top-5-fictional-characters-that-are-literally-just-brains|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=2015-06-12}}</ref> In the ''Old World Blues'' downloadable content for the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' a group of scientists, dubbed the \"Think Tank\", have a more advanced version of the technology.\n* The video game ''[[Cortex Command]]'' revolves around the idea of brains being separated from physical bodies, and used to control units on a battlefield.\n* The Mother Brain from the game ''[[Metroid]]''.<ref name=vice1/>\n\n===Other===\n*A [[brainship]] is a fictional concept of an interstellar starship. A brainship is made by inserting the disembodied brain and nervous system or malformed body of a human being into a life-support system, and connecting it surgically to a series of computers via delicate synaptic connections (a [[brain\u2013computer interface]]). The brain \"feels\" the ship (or any other connected peripherals) as part of its own body. An example, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969) short story collection by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] is about the brainship ''Helva''. \"[[Mr. Spaceship]]\" (1959)  is an earlier story by Phillip K. Dick about a brainship. \n*The B'omarr Monks, of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Universe, would surgically remove their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment.

It was only with the opening up of previously concealed government records that followed the [[Die Wende|political collapse]] of the [[Peaceful Revolution|East German]] and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet dictatorships]] in 1989/90 that Margarete Forszpaniak, a former [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance comrade]], disclosed the truth about Pietzuch's death to the historian  [[:de:Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df|Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df]],<ref name=EPlautHDK/> having herself learned it two decades earlier from  [[:de:Heinz Wieland|Heinz Wieland]], the responsible [[East Germany|East German]] [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Central Committee]] official.<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200702\"/>\n\n==Life and activism==\n===Provenance and early years===\nEmil Pietzuch was born in [[:de:Kreis Neurode|Neurode]], near [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was known before)]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|1945)]]. He grew up in conditions of some poverty and trained as a carpenter-joiner. During the final part of the [[First World War]] he was conscripted for [[German Army (German Empire)|war service]]. [[Aftermath of World War I|After the war ended]] he settled in [[Berlin]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\n===International communist===\nIn August 1922 Pietzuch joined the recently launched [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]]. In 1924 he took over party duties as head of the \"Zersewtzungsapparet\" (''loosely, \"degradation aparatus\"''), targeting military and police personnel in [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|the Berlin-Brandenburg region]]. Towards the end of 1925 he was arrested in connection with this activity. He faced trial at the [[Reichsgericht|Supreme Court of Justice]] which determined that he had been disseminating \"anti-military propaganda among army and [[:de:Schutzpolizei (Weimarer Republik)|police]] personnel\" (''\"...antimilitaristische Propaganda unter der Reichswehr und der Schutzpolizei\"''), which supported a charge of \"preparing high treason\" (''\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\"''). Found guilty in June 1926, he was sentenced to a thirty-month jail term.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\nAfter a conditional early release in the middle part of 1927 Pitzuch made his way to [[Mannheim]] where he became a [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] organiser (''\"Orgleiter\"'') for the [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] region. He returned to [[Berlin]] in 1928.  He now worked with the Trades Union department of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Party]] [[Central Committee]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   Later that year he traveled to [[Moscow]] where he took part on the [[:de:Kommunistische Internationale#VI. Weltkongress 1928 \u2013 Sozialfaschismusthese|Sixth World Congress]] of the [[Communist International|Communist International (''\"Comintern\"'')]] and was elected to various committees and commissions.  Back in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], in 1929 he was accepted into to the national leadership of the party's recently established [[Revolution\u00e4re Gewerkschafts Opposition|Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (''\"Revolution\u00e4re Gewerkschafts Opposition\"'')]], intended as the basis for an alternative communist sponsored trades union movement.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\nIn April 1932, Pietzuch returned to [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] where he resumed his activities as [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] organiser (''\"Orgleiter\"'').   Later that year and during much of 1933 he was back in [[Moscow]], this time as an [[:de:Aspirantur|\"aspirant student\"]] at the secretive \"M-School\" ('''military training establishment'') surrounded by a large partially wooded area fenced about with barbed wire at [[Kuntsevo District|Bakovka (Kuntsevo)]], some 20 miles to the west of central Moscow.<ref name=M-SchgulelautAH>{{cite web|url=https://www.kommunismusgeschichte.de/fileadmin/user_upload/JHK/2008/30_JHK_2008_Herbst_JHK_final.pdf|title=Unteroffiziere der Revolution.

Sources are vague on the timelines of Pietzuch's actions over the next few years, but during or before the first part of 1934 he was back in Germany, with instructions from comrades to organise communist sabotage and terror activities.<ref name=EPlautGM/>  According to [[People's Court (Germany)|court]] documents prepared for a trial in 1940 (which would never take place because Pietzuch was by that time permanently abroad) over the next few years Pietzuch recruited a significant number of actists who were involved in courier work, passing messages and distributing political publications, or entrusted with \"special tasks\".<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\nIn 1936, with [[Gestapo]] surveillance becoming increasingly ubiquitous, Pietzuch left Germany and, like many resistance activists at this time, headed for [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\">{{cite book|author=[[:de:Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df|Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df]]|title=Attentats- und Sprengstoffpl\u00e4ne (Apparat Pietzuch)|work=Die \u00bbandere\u00ab Reichshauptstadt: Widerstand aus der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3scIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA419|date=26 January 2007|publisher=Lukas Verlag |isbn=978-3-936872-94-1|pages=414\u2013419|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>   Here he was arrested and detained on charges of espionage offences against [[First Czechoslovak Republic|the Czechoslovak state]].   Release soon followed, however, and he made his way back to [[Moscow]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/><ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of 1937 Pietzuch returned to [[Berlin]] where he participated with fellow activists in the preparation of violent measures targeting the [[Nazi Germany|state]].  By 2 April 1937 he was living secretly with Karl and Eleonore Bartel in their apartment at [[:de:Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe (Berlin-Tiergarten)|Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe 74]] in the city centre.   That morning he was at the [[Kitchen stove]] conducting experiments with explosives, with a view to the larger scale manufacture of bombs and detonators for use in sabotage actions.   Unexpectedly, his experiments triggered a large explosion.   The entire kitchen area was destroyed along with half of the living room.    Much of the detail surrounding the event comes from the prosecution documents prepared two years later for the trial of the (by that time) widow Eleonore Bartel (and others) dated 20 October 1939: the information must be presumed to have been obtained through interrogation of members and fringe associates of the \"Apparat Pietzuch\".   The explosion caused Pitzuch serious facial injuries.  His right hand was also badly damaged.<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/>\n\nWhile a local policeman came in to investigate, Pietzuch was able to hide successfully.   The policeman then went off to assemble some colleague for a more thorough search of the apartment:  by the time they all arrived Pietzuch had left the building.   The extent of Pietzuch's network of contacts now became apparent.   Eleonore Bartel bandaged up his injured arm with a dish cloth and he set off in a taxi to [[Sch\u00f6neberg|Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg]] where the dentistry practice Ingelath-Geerken provided a certain level of first aid and patched up his damaged face.   He then visited first one and then a second Jewish physician, Dr. Zuckermann and Dr. Silberstein.   For his own \"security reasons\", Pietzuch was unable to attend a public hospital and was therefore restricted to \"private\" doctors at this time of need.   After his most urgent medical needs had been attended to, he moved on to Schwinem\u00fcndestra\u00dfe 21 in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Berlin-Wedding]] another district of central Berlin, where he visited another trusted associate, the electrician Herbert Nicolai.   The electrician provided money and a set of false identity papers, armed with which Emil Pietzuch headed for the railway station.   Still on the day of that explosion, shortly before midnight, he caught a scheduled train to [[Prague]].   As far as is known he would never see Germany again.<ref name=EPlautHDK/><ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/>\n\n===Final exile===\nPrague at this time had become a third informal capital (along with Moscow and Paris) for the [[Communist Party of Germany|exiled German Communist Party]].   Pietzuch remained there for nearly two years, during which time the [[Sudetenland|German-speaking borderlands of Czechoslovakia (''\"Sudetenland\"'')]] were incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]] with [[Munich Agreement|French and English agreement]].   As far as can be determined Pietzuch held no formal position within the party during this period.   Party reports indicate that he was not trusted by party comrades as far back as 1936.   There is reference to his having made approaches to party members without liaising with party leaders, and there was indeed mention (which at this stage came to nothing) of quietly excluding him from party membership.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   It was only in March 1939, with the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German military taek-over]] of the rest of Czechoslovakia, that Pietzuch left [[Prague]], from where he now moved back to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   For reasons that remain unclear the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Gestapo|authorities]] became convinced that Pietzuch had made his way from [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] not to [[Russia]] but to [[England]].   In 1940 his name was included on the [[The Black Book|\"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B\"]] which listed British residents to be prioritized for discovery and arrest by [[Schutzstaffel|Nazi paramilitariers]] following a successful German invasion of the [[Great Britain|islands]].<ref name=Sonderfahndungsopfer>{{cite web|title=Hitler's Black Book - information for Emil Pietzuch|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/hitlers-black-book/person/892/emil-pietzuch|work=Forces War Record|publisher=Clever Digit Media - UK|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that the mistrust of comrades which had been apparent in [[Prague]] will have followed him to [[Moscow]] where he fell foul of the [[:de:Stalinsche S\u00e4uberungen|Stalin purges]] which were intensively focused on German political exiles in [[Moscow]] in response to the [[Operation Barbarossa|sudden invasion]] in June 1941 of the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in defiance of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] negotiated and concluded between the dictator-states two years earlier.

It was only with the opening up of previously concealed government records that followed the [[Die Wende|political collapse]] of the [[Peaceful Revolution |East German]] and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union |Soviet dictatorships]] in 1989/90 that Margarete Forszpaniak, a former [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance comrade]], disclosed the truth about Pietzuch's death to the historian  [[:de:Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df|Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df]],<ref name=EPlautHDK/> having herself learned it two decades earlier from  [[:de:Heinz Wieland|Heinz Wieland]], the responsible [[East Germany|East German]] [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Central Committee]] official.<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200702\"/> \n\n==Life and activism==\n===Provenance and early years===\nEmil Pietzuch was born in [[:de:Kreis Neurode|Neurode]], near [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was known before)]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|1945)]]. He grew up in conditions of some poverty and trained as a carpenter-joiner. During the final part of the [[First World War]] he was conscripted for [[German Army (German Empire) |war service]]. [[Aftermath of World War I|After the war ended]] he settled in [[Berlin]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\n===International communist===\nIn August 1922 Pietzuch joined the recently launched [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]]. In 1924 he took over party duties as head of the \"Zersewtzungsapparet\" (''loosely, \"degradation aparatus\"''), targetting military and police personnel in [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|the Berlin-Brandenburg region]]. Towards the end of 1925 he was arrested in connection with this activity. He faced trial at the [[Reichsgericht|Supreme Court of Justice]] which determined that he had been disseminating \"anti-military propaganda among army and [[:de:Schutzpolizei (Weimarer Republik)|police]] personnel\" (''\"...antimilitaristische Propaganda unter der Reichswehr und der Schutzpolizei\"''), which supported a charge of \"preparing high treason\" (''\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\"''). Found guilty in June 1926, he was sentenced to a thirty month jail term.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\nAfter a conditional early release in the middle part of 1927 Pitzuch made his way to [[Mannheim]] where he became a [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] organiser (''\"Orgleiter\"'') for the [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] region. He returned to [[Berlin]] in 1928.  He now worked with the Trades Union department of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Party]] [[Central Committee]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   Later that year he traveled to [[Moscow]] where he took part on the [[:de:Kommunistische Internationale#VI. Weltkongress 1928 \u2013 Sozialfaschismusthese|Sixth World Congress]] of the [[Communist International|Communist International (''\"Comintern\"'')]] and was elected to various committees and commissions.  Back in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], in 1929 he was accepted into to the national leadership of the party's recently established [[Revolution\u00e4re Gewerkschafts Opposition|Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (''\"Revolution\u00e4re Gewerkschafts Opposition\"'')]], intended as the basis for an alternative communist sponsored trades union movement.<ref name=EPlautHDK/> \n\nIn April 1932, Pietzuch returned to [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] where he resumed his activities as [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] organiser (''\"Orgleiter\"'').   Later that year and during much of 1933 he was back in [[Moscow]], this time as an [[:de:Aspirantur|\"aspirant student\"]] at the secretive \"M-School\" ('''military training establishment'') surrounded by a large partially wooded area fenced about with barbed wire at [[Kuntsevo District|Bakovka (Kuntsevo)]], some 20 miles to the west of central Moscow.<ref name=M-SchgulelautAH>{{cite web|url=https://www.kommunismusgeschichte.de/fileadmin/user_upload/JHK/2008/30_JHK_2008_Herbst_JHK_final.pdf|title=Unteroffiziere der Revolution.

Sources are vague on the timelines of Pietzuch's actions over the next few years, but during or before the first part of 1934 he was back in Germany, with instructions from comrades to organise communist sabotage and terror activities.<ref name=EPlautGM/>  According to [[People's Court (Germany) |court]] documents prepared for a trial in 1940 (which would never take place because Pietzuch was by that time permanently abroad) over the next few years Pietzuch recruited a significant number of actists who were involved in courier work, passing messages and distributing political publications, or entrusted with \"special tasks\".<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\nIn 1936, with [[Gestapo]] surveillance becoming increasingly ubiquitous, Pietzuch left Germany and, like many resistance activists at this time, headed for [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\">{{cite book|author=[[:de:Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df|Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df]]|title=Attentats- und Sprengstoffpl\u00e4ne (Apparat Pietzuch)|work=Die \u00bbandere\u00ab Reichshauptstadt: Widerstand aus der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3scIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA419|date=26 January 2007|publisher=Lukas Verlag |isbn=978-3-936872-94-1|pages=414\u2013419|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>   Here he was arrested and detained on charges of espionage offences against [[First Czechoslovak Republic|the Czechoslovak state]].   Release soon followed, however, and he made his way back to [[Moscow]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/><ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of 1937 Pietzuch returned to [[Berlin]] where he participated with fellow activists in the preparation of violent measures targeting the [[Nazi Germany|state]].  By 2 April 1937 he was living secretly with Karl and Eleonore Bartel in their apartment at [[:de:Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe (Berlin-Tiergarten)|Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe 74]] in the city centre.   That morning he was at the [[Kitchen stove]] conducting experiments with explosives, with a view to the larger scale manufacture of bombs and detonators for use in sabotage actions.   Unexpectedly, his experiments triggered a large explosion.   The entire kitchen area was destroyed along with half of the living room.    Much of the detail surrounding the event comes from the prosecution documents prepared two years later for the trial of the (by that time) widow Eleonore Bartel (and others) dated 20 October 1939: the information must be presumed to have been obtained through interrogation of members and fringe associates of the \"Apparat Pietzuch\".   The explosion caused Pitzuch serious facial injuries.  His right hand was also badly damaged.<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/> \n\nWhile a local policeman came in to investigate, Pietzuch was able to hide successfully.   The policeman then went off to assemble some colleague for a more thorough search of the apartment:  by the time they all arrived Pietzuch had left the building.   The extent of Pietzuch's network of contacts now became apparent.   Eleonore Bartel bandaged up his injured arm with a dish cloth and he set off in a taxi to [[Sch\u00f6neberg |Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg]] where the dentistry practice Ingelath-Geerken provided a certain level of first aid and patched up his damaged face.   He then visited first one and then a second Jewish physician, Dr. Zuckermann and Dr. Silberstein.   For his own \"security reasons\", Pietzuch was unable to attend a public hospital and was therefore restricted to \"private\" doctors at this time of need.   After his most urgent medical needs had been attended to, he moved on to Schwinem\u00fcndestra\u00dfe 21 in [[Wedding (Berlin) |Berlin-Wedding]] another district of central Berlin, where he visited another trusted associate, the electrician Herbert Nicolai.   The electrician provided money and a set of false identity papers, armed with which Emil Pietzuch headed for the railway station.   Still on the day of that explosion, shortly before midnight, he caught a scheduled train to [[Prague]].   As far as is known he would never see Germany again.<ref name=EPlautHDK/><ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200701\"/>\n\n===Final exile===\nPrague at this time had become a third informal capital (along with Moscow and Paris) for the [[Communist Party of Germany|exiled German Communist Party]].   Pietzuch remained there for nearly two years, during which time the [[Sudetenland |German-speaking borderlands of Czechoslovakia (''\"Sudetenland\"'')]] were incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]] with [[Munich Agreement |French and English agreement]].   As far as can be determined Pietzuch held no formal position within the party during this period.   Party reports indicate that he was not trusted by party comrades as far back as 1936.   There is reference to his having made approaches to party members without liaising with party leaders, and there was indeed mention (which at this stage came to nothing) of quietly excluding him from party membership.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   It was only in March 1939, with the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia |German military taek-over]] of the rest of Czechoslovakia, that Pietzuch left [[Prague]], from where he now moved back to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/>   For reasons that remain unclear the [[Nazi Germany |German]] [[Gestapo|authorities]] became convinced that Pietzuch had made his way from [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia |Czechoslovakia]] not to [[Russia]] but to [[England]].   In 1940 his name was included on the [[The Black Book|\"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B\"]] which listed British residents to be prioritized for discovery and arrest by [[Schutzstaffel |Nazi paramilitariers]] following a successful German invasion of the [[Great Britain |islands]].<ref name=Sonderfahndungsopfer>{{cite web|title=Hitler's Black Book - information for Emil Pietzuch|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/hitlers-black-book/person/892/emil-pietzuch|work=Forces War Record|publisher=Clever Digit Media - UK|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that the mistrust of comrades which had been apparent in [[Prague]] will have followed him to [[Moscow]] where he fell foul of the [[:de:Stalinsche S\u00e4uberungen |Stalin purges]] which were intensively focused on German political exiles in [[Moscow]] in response to the [[Operation Barbarossa|sudden invasion]] in June 1941 of the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in defiance of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] negotiated and concluded between the dictator-states two years earlier.   On 22 June 1941, Emil Pietzuch was arrested by the [[NKVD|homeland security services]].<ref name=EPlautHDK/><ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200702\">{{cite book|author=[[:de:Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df|Hans-Rainer Sandvo\u00df]]|title=Zerschlagung der Berliner Unterbezirke (1935-37)  |work=Die \u00bbandere\u00ab Reichshauptstadt: Widerstand aus der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3scIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA423|date=26 January 2007|publisher=Lukas Verlag |isbn=978-3-936872-94-1|pages=423\u2013433|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>   He faced trial on 4 December 1943 and was sentenced to five year's loss of liberty.<ref name=\"Sandvo\u00df200702\"/>   He did not survive his detention, and indeed probably died at the hands of the [[Gulag]] in 1943.<ref name=EPlautHDK/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pietzuch, Emil}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1943 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians]]\n[[Category:Great Purge victims from Germany]]\n[[Category:People who died in the Gulag]]\n]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: thirty month \u2192 thirty-month, targetting \u2192 targeting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Pietzuch"}

Donkey Kong's cage is guarded by [[Mario]], in his only appearance as an antagonist in a Nintendo video game.\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. must rescue his father by working his way through a series of four screens. Mario attempts to stop DK Jr. by releasing animals and putting obstacles in his way. When DK Jr. succeeds on the last screen, Donkey Kong is freed and kicks Mario into the distance, leaving him to run away and to an unknown fate; the game then begins again at a higher difficulty level.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. (arcade game).png|thumb|left|Donkey Kong Jr. trying to rescue his father from the cage next to Mario.]]\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' is a platform game. There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include \"Snapjaws,\" which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called \"Nitpickers,\" some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and \"Sparks\" which roam across the wiring in one of Mario's hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.\n\nTo pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father's cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing it off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player's score upon completion.\n\nDK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, or falls off the bottom of the screen. Additionally, he loses a life if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives.\n\n===Versions===\nThe order of the levels is different in different territories. In the Japanese version, the four levels appear in 1-2-3-4 sequence and then repeat, just as with the Japanese release of ''Donkey Kong''. In the US version, the order is 1-4. 1-2-4, 1-3-4, 1-2-3-4 and then 1-2-3-4 from then on.\n\n===Kill screen===\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' has a kill screen at level 22. Due to the level counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17\u201322. The kill screen occurs the same way as in Donkey Kong, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are taken.\n\n==Ports==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. Game&watch.jpg|thumb|New Wide Screen Game & Watch ''Donkey Kong Jr.'']]\n\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] (for which it was one of three Japanese [[launch game]]s<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|pages=56\u201361|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref>), [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Coleco Adam]], and [[Intellivision]].

Two black-and-white versions for the New Wide Screen and Multi Screen handheld series (the later under the model name ''[[Donkey Kong II]]''), and a color version for the Tabletop and Panorama series.\n\n==Reception==\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' received an award in the category of \"1984 Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects (16K or more ROM)\" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]], where the judges described it as \"great fun\", and noted that the game was successful as a sequel\u2013\"extend[ing] the theme and present[ing] a radically different play-action\" than its predecessor, ''Donkey Kong''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |date= January 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The Arcade Awards, Part 1 |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 10|pages= 40\u201342|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|42}}\n\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' is regarded as one of the ''Top 100 Video Games'' by the [[Killer List of Videogames]].

The game's title is written out as '''''Donkey Kong Junior''''' in the North American arcade version and various ports to non-Nintendo systems.\n\nThe game was principally designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and one of his coworkers.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/081403.shtml |title=Miyamoto Interview |journal=[[Nintendo Official Magazine UK]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |date=September 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210073052/http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/081403.shtml |archivedate=December 10, 2006 }}</ref> Miyamoto also created the graphics for the title along with [[Yoshio Sakamoto]].<ref name=\"artist\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/sakamoto/|title=Q&A: Metroid Creator's Early 8-Bit Days at Nintendo| first=Chris|last=Kohler|date=April 7, 2010|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired: GameLife]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the music for the game was composed by Yukio Kaneoka.<ref name=\"composer\">{{cite AV media notes|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/404|title=Famicom 20th Anniversary Original Sound Tracks Vol. 1|year=2004|publisher=Scitron Digital Contents}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's protagonist, Donkey Kong Junior, also called simply Junior<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various37_list.html |title=Sticker List |first=Masahiro |last=Sakurai |authorlink=Masahiro Sakurai |date=April 9, 2008 |work=Smash Bros.

Donkey Kong's cage is guarded by [[Mario]], in his only appearance as an antagonist in a Nintendo video game.\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. must rescue his father by working his way through a series of four screens. Mario attempts to stop DK Jr. by releasing animals and putting obstacles in his way. When DK Jr. succeeds on the last screen, Donkey Kong is freed and kicks Mario into the distance, leaving him to run away and to an unknown fate; the game then begins again at a higher difficulty level.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. (arcade game).png|thumb|left|Donkey Kong Jr. trying to rescue his father from the cage next to Mario.]]\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' is a platform game. There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include \"Snapjaws,\" which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called \"Nitpickers,\" some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and \"Sparks\" which roam across the wiring in one of Mario's hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.\n\nTo pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father's cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing it off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player's score upon completion.\n\nDK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, or falls off the bottom of the screen. Additionally, he loses a life if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives.\n\n===Versions===\nThe order of the levels is different in different territories. In the Japanese version, the four levels appear in 1-2-3-4 sequence and then repeat, just as with the Japanese release of ''Donkey Kong''. In the US version, the order is 1-4. 1-2-4, 1-3-4, 1-2-3-4 and then 1-2-3-4 from then on.\n\n===Kill screen===\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' has a kill screen at level 22. Due to the level counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17-22. The kill screen occurs the same way as in Donkey Kong, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are taken.\n\n==Ports==\n[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. Game&watch.jpg|thumb|New Wide Screen Game & Watch ''Donkey Kong Jr.'']]\n\n''Donkey Kong Jr.'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] (for which it was one of three Japanese [[launch game]]s<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|pages=56\u201361|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref>), [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Coleco Adam]], and [[Intellivision]].
