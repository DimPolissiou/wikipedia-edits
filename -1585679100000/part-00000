Because they gather together around [[wound]]s, mast cells may play a part in wound healing.

Researchers also think mast cells may have a role in the growth of [[blood vessel]]s ([[angiogenesis]]). No one with ''too few'' or no mast cells has been found, which indicates to some scientists we may not be able to survive with too few mast cells.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nMast cells express a [[cell surface receptor]], ''c-kit''<ref name=\"pmid17555444\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Orfao A, Garcia-Montero AC, Sanchez L, Escribano L |title=Recent advances in the understanding of mastocytosis: the role of KIT mutations |journal=Br.

Because they gather together around [[wound]]s, mast cells may play a part in wound healing. For example, the typical itching felt around a healing scab may be caused by [[histamine]] released by mast cells. Researchers also think mast cells may have a role in the growth of [[blood vessel]]s ([[angiogenesis]]). No one with ''too few'' or no mast cells has been found, which indicates to some scientists we may not be able to survive with too few mast cells.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nMast cells express a [[cell surface receptor]], ''c-kit''<ref name=\"pmid17555444\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Orfao A, Garcia-Montero AC, Sanchez L, Escribano L |title=Recent advances in the understanding of mastocytosis: the role of KIT mutations |journal=Br.

It initially was located in a building at the corner of King and Eby streets in the downtown area, and tuition cost five shillings per month.

With increasing numbers at the Central School, the school then moved to the former [[Swedenborgian Church]] on Church Street.\n\nIn 1874, land was purchased at a cost of $650 for the first permanent home for the school at its current location on King Street West, closer to the Waterloo border.  The building cost $5,804 and opened in 1876.  By this time it was called '''Berlin High School''' (Ontario legislation passed in 1871 renamed grammar schools \"high schools).\"\n\nIn 1876, teacher [[David Forsyth (soccer)|David Forsyth]] started laboratory experiments in science class.

On November 30, 1904, a Provincial-Order-in-Council raised the school to the status of a [[collegiate institute]], and the school became the '''Berlin Collegiate Institute'''.  By 1905 the new building was in use.  The school changed names along with the city in 1916 to '''Kitchener Collegiate Institute'''.\n\nBy 1919 the school was quite crowded, and the office and other unsuitable rooms were being used as classrooms.  As well, the Dominion and Provincial governments had recently announced a policy assisting municipalities in funding of schools.  Plans for an expansion were drawn, but were not approved by the municipality.  Two years later, however, a set of revised plans were approved.  These plans involved demolishing the 1876 building, modernizing the 1903&ndash;4 building, which still stands, and placing in front of it a new gymnasium, auditorium, front hall, and classrooms, as well as an east wing of classrooms in place of the 1876 building. Construction started on July 2, 1922.  The new school opened for classes on September 4, 1923.  The formal opening of the building took place on April 4, 1924, when the school was given its current name.\n[[File:Kci-1924.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Kitchener\u2013Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School shortly after the opening of the 1924 extension.]]\nIn 1924 there were 550 students, a figure that had increased to 1,418 students by 1932.  Due to cramped conditions, grade 9 classes were held in the downtown [[Victoria Public School]] and in [[King Edward Public School]] from 1933 to 1951, when the west-wing addition was completed.<ref>Boulden, 1980</ref>\n\nIn 1948, KCI introduced driver education, one of the first schools to do so.\n\nIn 1955, KCI celebrated its 100th anniversary.  For the previous hundred years, KCI had been the only public high school in Kitchener and Waterloo.  However, in 1956, [[Eastwood Collegiate Institute]] opened.  Less than 20 years later there were eight high schools in Kitchener and Waterloo.  Many of the new schools' principals were former teachers at KCI.\n\nIn 1969, the Kitchener and Waterloo High School Board, which had been the governing body of the school for over a century, came to an end.  KCI became part of the Waterloo County Board of Education (now the [[Waterloo Region District School Board]]).\n\nIn the 1970s, the City of Kitchener designated the front foyer of the school as a heritage structure under the provisions of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\nThe school's 125th anniversary celebrations took place on the weekend of May 16&ndash;18, 1980.  Over six thousand former students took part.\n\nIn 2003, considerable controversy arose when the Waterloo Region District School Board was selecting a high school to close, in order to open [[Huron Heights Secondary School (Kitchener)|a new school]] in the southwest end of Kitchener (this was required under the provincial funding model of the time). A large public outcry began when the staff report recommended the closure of KCI, along with [[Southwood Secondary School]]. Although the school was plagued with many heating, plumbing and electrical problems due to its age, sentimentality and emotions won the day and some repairs and renovations were decided upon. Critics of this proposal noted that KCI had a significant history and a unique culture among secondary schools in Kitchener and Waterloo, partly due to the wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds among its students.  Regardless of the enormous job and associated costs, further analysis of the financial situation by trustees, eliminated the need for a Kitchener school closure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/school_closings_mayor.pdf |title=Comm_schools presentation book<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165457/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/school_closings_mayor.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, football coach Ed Dietrich was selected runner-up \"NFL/CFL High School Coach of the Year\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.universitysport.ca/e/championships/vaniercup/2004/print_story.cfm?ID=3634 |title=Canadian University Sports<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927082247/http://www.universitysport.ca/e/championships/vaniercup/2004/print_story.cfm?ID=3634 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the school celebrated its 150th anniversary reunion from May 27\u201329.\n\nThe school underwent extensive renovations in 2006, with money from the provincial government.\nSome students are concerned that there is still no air conditioning.\n\n[[File:Kci bldg.JPG|thumb|400px|Building facade, 2005]]\n\nIn March 2017, KCI opened its renovated main office. The space now includes a new meeting room, staff mailbox area and unisex washrooms; the construction used wood reclaimed from the original office.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe school colours are red, yellow, and black (adopted from the [[flag of Germany]] because of the city's German heritage), and its motto is ''Veritas Vincat'' ([[Latin]], May Truth Prevail); until 1916 the motto was ''H\u00f6her Hinauf'' ([[German language|German]], To the Heights).  At various points since his introduction, there have been [[Native American mascot controversy|contentious debates]] about the propriety of the former school mascot, a [[First Nations]] raider named Rodney. Citing the issue of racism and pressure from special interest groups, the school reluctantly change the school mascot to a pirate while maintaining the raider name.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Wlmk.JPG|thumb|150px|Statue of W.L.M.

On November 30, 1904, a Provincial-Order-in-Council raised the school to the status of a [[collegiate institute]], and the school became the '''Berlin Collegiate Institute'''.  By 1905 the new building was in use.  The school changed names along with the city in 1916 to '''Kitchener Collegiate Institute'''.\n\nBy 1919 the school was quite crowded, and the office and other unsuitable rooms were being used as classrooms.  As well, the Dominion and Provincial governments had recently announced a policy assisting municipalities in funding of schools.  Plans for an expansion were drawn, but were not approved by the municipality.  Two years later, however, a set of revised plans were approved.  These plans involved demolishing the 1876 building, modernizing the 1903&ndash;4 building, which still stands, and placing in front of it a new gymnasium, auditorium, front hall, and classrooms, as well as an east wing of classrooms in place of the 1876 building. Construction started on July 2, 1922.  The new school opened for classes on September 4, 1923.  The formal opening of the building took place on April 4, 1924, when the school was given its current name.\n[[File:Kci-1924.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Kitchener\u2013Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School shortly after the opening of the 1924 extension.]]\nIn 1924 there were 550 students, a figure that had increased to 1,418 students by 1932.  Due to cramped conditions, grade 9 classes were held in the downtown [[Victoria Public School]] and in [[King Edward Public School]] from 1933 to 1951, when the west-wing addition was completed.<ref>Boulden, 1980</ref>\n\nIn 1948, KCI introduced driver education, one of the first schools to do so.\n\nIn 1955, KCI celebrated its 100th anniversary.  For the previous hundred years, KCI had been the only public high school in Kitchener and Waterloo.  However, in 1956, [[Eastwood Collegiate Institute]] opened.  Less than 20 years later there were eight high schools in Kitchener and Waterloo.  Many of the new schools' principals were former teachers at KCI.\n\nIn 1969, the Kitchener and Waterloo High School Board, which had been the governing body of the school for over a century, came to an end.  KCI became part of the Waterloo County Board of Education (now the [[Waterloo Region District School Board]]).\n\nIn the 1970s, the City of Kitchener designated the front foyer of the school as a heritage structure under the provisions of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\nThe school's 125th anniversary celebrations took place on the weekend of May 16&ndash;18, 1980.  Over six thousand former students took part.\n\nIn 2003, considerable controversy arose when the Waterloo Region District School Board was selecting a high school to close, in order to open [[Huron Heights Secondary School (Kitchener)|a new school]] in the southwest end of Kitchener (this was required under the provincial funding model of the time). A large public outcry began when the staff report recommended the closure of KCI, along with [[Southwood Secondary School]]. Although the school was plagued with many heating, plumbing and electrical problems due to its age, sentimentality and emotions won the day and some repairs and renovations were decided upon. Critics of this proposal noted that KCI had a significant history and a unique culture among secondary schools in Kitchener and Waterloo, partly due to the wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds among its students.  Regardless of the enormous job and associated costs, further analysis of the financial situation by trustees, eliminated the need for a Kitchener school closure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/school_closings_mayor.pdf |title=Comm_schools presentation book<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165457/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/school_closings_mayor.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, football coach Ed Dietrich was selected runner-up \"NFL/CFL High School Coach of the Year\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.universitysport.ca/e/championships/vaniercup/2004/print_story.cfm?ID=3634 |title=Canadian University Sports<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927082247/http://www.universitysport.ca/e/championships/vaniercup/2004/print_story.cfm?ID=3634 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the school celebrated its 150th anniversary reunion from May 27\u201329.\n\nThe school underwent extensive renovations in 2006, with money from the provincial government.\nSome students are concerned that there is still no air conditioning.\n\n[[File:Kci bldg.JPG|thumb|400px|Building facade, 2005]]\n\nIn March 2017, KCI opened its renovated main office. The space now includes a new meeting room, staff mailbox area and unisex washrooms; the construction used wood reclaimed from the original office.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe school colours are red, yellow, and black (adopted from the [[flag of Germany]] because of the city's German heritage), and its motto is ''Veritas Vincat'' ([[Latin]], May Truth Prevail); until 1916 the motto was ''H\u00f6her Hinauf'' ([[German language|German]], To the Heights).  At various points since his introduction, there have been [[Native American mascot controversy|contentious debates]] about the propriety of the former school mascot, a [[First Nations]] raider named Rodney. Citing the issue of racism and pressure from special interest groups, the school reluctantly change the school mascot to a pirate while maintaining the raider name.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Wlmk.JPG|thumb|150px|Statue of W.L.M. King, on the school's lawn]]The most famous alumnus of the school was [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]] for over 21 years, who was a student between 1887 and 1891.
