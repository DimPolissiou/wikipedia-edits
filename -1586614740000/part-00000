It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months. In February 640, an assault group, led by the prominent Huzaifah ibn Wala, successfully captured the fort and city.<ref>Al-Kamil, pp. 451\u2013452</ref><ref>Al-Gawzi, Al-Montazim, pp. 532\u2013534</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], History of the Kings, p. 862</ref><ref>[[Abu Salih the Armenian]], ''The churches and monasteries of Egypt and some neighbouring countries'', tr.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl. Willard Wood, (Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 10.</ref> The city boasted the Sun Temple of the [[Pharaohs]] and grandiose monuments and learning institutions.<ref name=\"Butler258\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=258}}</ref> There was the danger that forces from Heliopolis could attack the Muslims from the flank while they were engaged with the Roman army at Babylon.\n\nThere was a cavalry clash near the current neighbourhood of [[Abbaseya]]. The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule.

Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]]. The project was presented to 'Umar, who approved it. A canal was dug and, within a few months, was opened for merchants. It was named \"Nahar Amir ul-Mu'mineen\" (''the canal of the Commander of the Faithful''), after 'Umar's title.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nAmr proposed to dig another canal joining the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> but Umar rejected the plan on the basis that it would open a way for the Byzantine Navy to enter the Red Sea and pose a threat to [[Medina]] itself.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> The plan would not come to fruition until the [[Suez Canal]] was completed 1300 years later. Each year, the caliph earmarked a large amount of jizya, to be used on the building and repairing of canals and bridges.<ref name=\"Haykalch25\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 25}}</ref> The Arabs remained in control of the country from this point until 1250, when it fell under the control of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)]]\n*[[Muslim conquests]]\n*[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]\n*[[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]]\n*[[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Betts|first=Robert B.|title=Christians in the Arab East: A Political Study|year=1978|edition=2nd rev.|location=Athens|publisher=Lycabettus Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHstAQAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alfred |title=The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |url=https://archive.org/details/arabconquestofeg00butl |year=1902 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Charles|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert Charles (scholar)|title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text|year=2007|origyear=1916|location=Merchantville, NJ|publisher=Evolution Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZ-DOr77OQC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |author-link=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=Al Farooq, Umar |year=1944 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in |url=https://archive.org/details/greatarabconques00kenn_0 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81740-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ostrogorsky|first=George|authorlink=George Ostrogorsky|year=1956|title=History of the Byzantine State|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt0_AAAAYAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211753/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter51.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=51}}\n* {{citation |last=Nikiou |first=Bishop John |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu |chapter=CXVI\u2013CXXI}}\n\n{{Egypt topics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muslim Conquest Of Egypt}}\n[[Category:640s conflicts]]\n[[Category:7th century in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Islamization of Egypt}}\n{{short description|Invasion of Roman Egypt, then part of the Byzantine Empire, by the Rashidun Caliphate between 639 and 646}}\n{{Cleanup|date=January 2012}}\n{{story|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| image             = File:Roman Theater in the city of Alexandria .

It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months. In February 640, an assault group, led by the prominent Huzaifah ibn Wala, successfully captured the fort and city.<ref>Al-Kamil, pp. 451\u2013452</ref><ref>Al-Gawzi, Al-Montazim, pp. 532\u2013534</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], History of the Kings, p. 862</ref><ref>[[Abu Salih the Armenian]], ''The churches and monasteries of Egypt and some neighbouring countries'', tr.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl. Willard Wood, (Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 10.</ref> The city boasted the Sun Temple of the [[Pharaohs]] and grandiose monuments and learning institutions.<ref name=\"Butler258\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=258}}</ref> There was the danger that forces from Heliopolis could attack the Muslims from the flank while they were engaged with the Roman army at Babylon.\n\nThere was a cavalry clash near the current neighbourhood of [[Abbaseya]]. The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule. Even more remarkably, it has remained under Muslim rule ever since. Seldom in history can so massive a political change have happened so swiftly and been so long lasting.\"<ref name=\"Kennedy165\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=165}}</ref>\n\n[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] then used Egypt as a launch pad to move across North Africa, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"Kennedy212\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=212}}</ref> Kennedy wrote that when Uqba reached the Atlantic, he is said to have ridden his horse into the sea until the water was below his chest, and then shouted, 'O Lord, if the sea did not stop me, I would go through lands like Alexander the Great, defending your faith'. Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]]. The project was presented to 'Umar, who approved it. A canal was dug and, within a few months, was opened for merchants. It was named \"Nahar Amir ul-Mu'mineen\" (''the canal of the Commander of the Faithful''), after 'Umar's title.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nAmr proposed to dig another canal joining the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> but Umar rejected the plan on the basis that it would open a way for the Byzantine Navy to enter the Red Sea and pose a threat to [[Medina]] itself.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> The plan would not come to fruition until the [[Suez Canal]] was completed 1300 years later. Each year, the caliph earmarked a large amount of jizya, to be used on the building and repairing of canals and bridges.<ref name=\"Haykalch25\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 25}}</ref> The Arabs remained in control of the country from this point until 1250, when it fell under the control of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)]]\n*[[Muslim conquests]]\n*[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]\n*[[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]]\n*[[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Betts|first=Robert B.|title=Christians in the Arab East: A Political Study|year=1978|edition=2nd rev.|location=Athens|publisher=Lycabettus Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHstAQAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alfred |title=The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |url=https://archive.org/details/arabconquestofeg00butl |year=1902 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Charles|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert Charles (scholar)|title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text|year=2007|origyear=1916|location=Merchantville, NJ|publisher=Evolution Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZ-DOr77OQC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |author-link=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=Al Farooq, Umar |year=1944 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in |url=https://archive.org/details/greatarabconques00kenn_0 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81740-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ostrogorsky|first=George|authorlink=George Ostrogorsky|year=1956|title=History of the Byzantine State|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt0_AAAAYAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211753/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter51.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=51}}\n* {{citation |last=Nikiou |first=Bishop John |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu |chapter=CXVI\u2013CXXI}}\n\n{{Egypt topics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muslim Conquest Of Egypt}}\n[[Category:640s conflicts]]\n[[Category:7th century in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n", "name_user": "JimmyMJA", "label": "safe", "comment": "This is not a Territorial Change, this edit seems to be in bad faith.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt"}

[[King Abdullah II of Jordan]] has attended their show in Jordan and has conveyed his appreciation of their work.\n\n==Background==\nThe Axis of Evil [[Comedy]] Tour was founded by standup comedian [[Ahmed Ahmed]], in order to wield [[jokes]] as weapons and combat post 9/11 [[prejudice]] in the United States. Along with Ahmed, the featuring comedians ([[Maz Jobrani]] and [[Aron Kader]]) had their own personal accounts of racist experiences that they have undergone within the United States, and used these stories as material for the comedy tour. \n[[Ahmed Ahmed]], the [[Egyptian-American]] and founder of the group, believed that post 9/11 standup material should be tested in the [[Middle East]] before traveling anywhere else. Before the group had even been formed, [[Ahmed Ahmed]] had been hired to perform a private show in [[Dubai]], in order to fundraise and put Palestinian kids through medical school. This led to the tour he called \u201cThe Axis of Evil Tour,\u201d in which he featured comics [[Maz Jobrani]], [[Aron Kader]], and himself to travel the United States with the aim to stop stereotyping and [[prejudice]] towards Middle Easterners through a comedic approach.\n\n[[Jamil Abu-Wardeh]], the producer of the Axis of Evil, was the one who brought the tour back to its origin, [[The Middle East]]. It was there that the comedy tour gained two additional members, [[Nemr Abou Nassar]] and [[Wonho Chung]]. Wonho was known especially for his ability to present the material in [[Arabic]], despite having a Korean descent. His ability to speak in [[Arabic]] and other languages as well as his charisma made him a vital addition of the tour. As for Nemr, he performed in five sold out shows, during each of which his performance received a standing ovation. The tour featured performances in Kuwait, UAE, Lebanon, Bahrain as well as other Arab countries.\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the end result was a success, the selling out of numerous performances from the first one at [[Lisner Auditorium]] at [[George Washington University]].\n\n==Main members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!National origin!!Name!!Nationality

Along with Ahmed, the featuring comedians ([[Maz Jobrani]] and [[Aron Kader]]) had their own personal accounts of racist experiences that they have undergone within the United States, and used these stories as material for the comedy tour. \n[[Ahmed Ahmed]], the [[Egyptian-American]] and founder of the group, believed that post 9/11 standup material should be tested in the [[Middle East]] before traveling anywhere else. Before the group had even been formed, [[Ahmed Ahmed]] had been hired to perform a private show in [[Dubai]], in order to fundraise and put Palestinian kids through medical school. This led to the tour he called \u201cThe Axis of Evil Tour,\u201d in which he featured comics [[Maz Jobrani]], [[Aron Kader]], and himself to travel the United States with the aim to stop stereotyping and [[prejudice]] towards Middle Easterners through a comedic approach.\n\n[[Jamil Abu-Wardeh]], the producer of the Axis of Evil, was the one who brought the tour back to its origin, [[The Middle East]]. It was there that the comedy tour gained two additional members, [[Nemr Abou Nassar]] and [[Wonho Chung]]. Wonho was known especially for his ability to present the material in [[Arabic]], despite having a Korean descent. His ability to speak in [[Arabic]] and other languages as well as his charisma made him a vital addition of the tour. As for Nemr, he performed in five sold out shows, during each of which his performance received a standing ovation. \nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the end result was a success, the selling out of numerous performances from the first one at [[Lisner Auditorium]] at [[George Washington University]].\n\n==Main members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!National origin!!Name!!Nationality

In 1983 some nine alternatives for the A3 were investigated by the Department for Transport, but assessment showed that only one which went around the north and west side of the Punch Bowl (the \"Red Route\"), crossing the Smallbrook Valley was viable. A public consultation on the route met with opposition and two\nalternatives were suggested both of which drew less support than the proposed route which in 1988 became the preferred route. Subsequent environmental surveys showed that this route would have substantial adverse impacts resulting in the proposal to adapt an earlier scheme by including a tunnel to avoid the most sensitive parts of the route. The scheme entered the Government\u2019s targeted programme of improvements in 2001.<ref name=DfTPamphlet/>\n\nA public inquiry was held in September 2004 to hear objections and to consider alternatives to the proposal. Among the alternative proposals was one for a surface route following a more westerly line that would avoid building a tunnel (an adaptation of the \"Red Route\"). Despite being significantly more expensive than building a surface road, a tunnel was preferred after two alternative surface schemes were rejected on environmental grounds.<ref name=PublicInquiry/><ref name=DfTPamphlet>{{cite web\n|title=A3 Hindhead Scheme - Explanation of the May 2004 Scheme and Non-Technical Summary of the Environmental Statement\n|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/61_nts_may2004.pdf\n|date=May 2004\n|publisher=Highways Agency\n|accessdate=6 August 2011\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182247/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/61_nts_may2004.pdf\n|archive-date=7 October 2009\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc_20110627\"/> \nThe decision to put part of the road in a tunnel pushed the cost of the project to \u00a3371 million,<ref name=\"dft\">{{cite press release | title = \u00a3371 million A3 improvements will go ahead | publisher = [[Department for Transport]] | date = 27 October 2006 | url = http://www.wired-gov.net/wg/wg-news-1.nsf/0/066B5C0DA1399C58802572AB004BDC21?OpenDocument | accessdate =1 March 2011 }}</ref> with the underground section costing \u00a3155,000 per metre (\u00a3142,000 per yard) making that section of road the second most expensive road in the UK per unit distance, after the [[Limehouse Link tunnel]].<ref name=\"bbc_20110627\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13924687 |title=The UK's last, great, expensive, short roads |work=News Magazine |publisher=BBC |date=27 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[Image:Hindhead Tunnel Geology.svg|right|300px|thumb|Geology of the Hindhead Tunnel]]\nThe Hindhead tunnel runs through a sequence of fine grained strata of the [[Lower Greensand]] Group that were laid over Wealden Clay during (part of the [[Wealden Group]]) during the [[Cretaceous|Lower Cretaceous]] period (70{{ndash}}140 million years ago) on the margins of the subsiding [[Weald Basin]]. The Greensand group consists of the Hythe Beds, which overlay a  {{convert|10|to|20|m|abbr=on}} layer of Atherfield Clay. The Hythe beds themselves, which host the tunnel, consist of the Upper Hythe bed, which has a four substrata identified by the letters \"A\" to \"D\", and the Lower Hythe bed, which has two strata which are identified by the letters \"A\" and \"B\". Originally that whole area was covered by the Burgate Beds, but when the Weald was uplifted, the Burgate Beds were eroded away.<ref>{{cite map \n|publisher= Ordnance Survey\n|title= Haslemere\n|year= 1969\n|scale= 1:63360\n|series= Geological Survey of Great Britain}}</ref>\n\nMost of the tunnel passes through the Upper Hythe C and D layers and the Lower Hythe A layer which are described as \"Weak, locally very weak to moderately strong, slightly clayey fine to medium sandstone with occasional thin beds of clayey/silty fine sand\" and typically has [[Compressive strength|Uniaxial Compressive Strength]] (UCS) values of 2\u20135&nbsp;MPa.

In 1983 some nine alternatives for the A3 were investigated by the Department for Transport, but assessment showed that only one which went around the north and west side of the Punch Bowl (the \"Red Route\"), crossing the Smallbrook Valley was viable. A public consultation on the route met with opposition and two\nalternatives were suggested both of which drew less support than the proposed route which in 1988 became the preferred route. Subsequent environmental surveys showed that this route would have substantial adverse impacts resulting in the proposal to adapt an earlier scheme by including a tunnel to avoid the most sensitive parts of the route. The scheme entered the Government\u2019s targeted programme of improvements in 2001.<ref name=DfTPamphlet/>\n\nA public inquiry was held in September 2004 to hear objections and to consider alternatives to the proposal. Among the alternative proposals was one for a surface route following a more westerly line that would avoid building a tunnel (an adaptation of the \"Red Route\"). Despite being significantly more expensive than building a surface road, a tunnel was preferred after two alternative surface schemes were rejected on environmental grounds.<ref name=PublicInquiry/><ref name=DfTPamphlet>{{cite web\n|title=A3 Hindhead Scheme - Explanation of the May 2004 Scheme and Non-Technical Summary of the Environmental Statement\n|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/61_nts_may2004.pdf\n|date=May 2004\n|publisher=Highways Agency\n|accessdate=6 August 2011\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182247/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/61_nts_may2004.pdf\n|archive-date=7 October 2009\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc_20110627\"/> \nThe decision to put part of the road in a tunnel pushed the cost of the project to \u00a3371 million,<ref name=\"dft\">{{cite press release | title = \u00a3371 million A3 improvements will go ahead | publisher = [[Department for Transport]] | date = 27 October 2006 | url = http://www.wired-gov.net/wg/wg-news-1.nsf/0/066B5C0DA1399C58802572AB004BDC21?OpenDocument | accessdate =1 March 2011 }}</ref> with the underground section costing \u00a3155,000 per metre (\u00a3142,000 per yard) making that section of road the second most expensive road in the UK per unit distance, after the [[Limehouse Link tunnel]].<ref name=\"bbc_20110627\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13924687 |title=The UK's last, great, expensive, short roads |work=News Magazine |publisher=BBC |date=27 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[Image:Hindhead Tunnel Geology.svg|right|300px|thumb|Geology of the Hindhead Tunnel]]\nThe Hindhead tunnel runs through a sequence of fine grained strata of the [[Lower Greensand]] Group that were laid over Wealden Clay during (part of the [[Wealden Group]]) during the [[Cretaceous|Lower Cretaceous]] period (70{{ndash}}140 million years ago) on the margins of the subsiding [[Weald Basin]].

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On October 14 Tauranga played a match on the Waihi Recreation Ground and lost 6-19 in front of a large attendance, Iles again leading the Tauranga team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Waihi-Tauranga League Match\n| page =2\n| publisher =Waihi Daily Telegraph, Volume XX, Issue 6741\n| date = 1922-10-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WHDT19221016.2.23\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>. These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]]. He was also turning out for the Cadets Old Boys senior side in the club competition <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Football on Monday Next/Te Puke Representatives to Visit Tauranga\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8302\n| date = 1923-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19230531.2.14\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final. On August 2 [[Karl Ifwersen]] brought down a team from Auckland from the Grammar Old Boys, College Rifles and Ponsonby clubs to play against a Tauranga XV captained by George Iles.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final.

[[Jane Austen]] (1775\u20131817), the author of such works as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read [[novelist]]s in the English language.<ref>Clark, Robert. \"[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5167 Jane Austen]\". ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' (subscription only). 8 January 2001. Retrieved 24 August 2008.</ref> Her novels are the subject of intense [[Literary theory|scholarly study]] and the centre of a diverse [[fandom|fan culture]].\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable, but received only a few [[Literary criticism|reviews]], albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard [[Richard Bentley (publisher)#Standard Novels series|Bentley's Standard Novels series]], which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.<ref>Looser, Devoney. ''The Making of Jane Austen''. 19\u201322.</ref>\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen|Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality\u2014dear aunt Jane\u2014and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up\u2014some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"\u2014but all claiming to be the true [[Janeite]]s, or those who properly appreciated her. The \"teeming masses\", meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honouring Austen, including in [[Amateur theatre|amateur theatricals]] in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.<ref>Looser, Devoney. ''The Making of Jane Austen''. 83\u201397.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]] prepared a carefully edited collection of her works, which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted within academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical. With the growing professionalisation of university [[English studies|English departments]] in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works. As of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 film ''Pride and Prejudice'']] and evolved to include productions such as the 2004 [[Bollywood]]-style film ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]''.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''Pride and Prejudice'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Jane Austen}}\n[[File:Houghton EC8 Au747 811s (B) - Sense and Sensibility.jpg|thumb|left|Austen signed her first published novel \"By a Lady\".|alt=Title page reads \"Sense and Sensibility: A Novel.

During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the [[epistolary novel]] which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park (novel)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously.<ref>Fergus, 13\u201314.</ref> Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an [[open secret]] among the [[British nobility|aristocracy]].<ref>Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 225.</ref> During one of her visits to London, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] invited her, through his librarian, [[James Stanier Clarke]], to view his library at [[Carlton House]]; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\".<ref>Qtd. in Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 226; also see [http://www.janeausten.co.uk/james-stanier-clarke-librarian-to-the-prince-of-wales/ Jane Austen to J. S. Clarke], 11 December 1815, courtesy of janeausten.co.uk, 17 July 2011.</ref> Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, ''Emma'' was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.<ref>Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 227.</ref>\n\n[[File:JaneAustenCassandraWatercolour.jpg|thumb|upright|A watercolour sketch of [[Jane Austen]] by her sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]] (c.&nbsp;1804)|alt=A sketch of a woman from the back sitting beneath a tree and wearing early 19th-century clothing and a bonnet]]\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817), wrote ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see ''Northanger Abbey'' or ''Persuasion'' through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death, and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\".<ref>Le Faye, \"Memoirs and biographies\", 51.</ref> This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives&nbsp;...

[[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough|Lady Bessborough]], sister to the notorious [[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]], commented on ''Sense and Sensibility'' in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel. &nbsp;...&nbsp;tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\"<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 7.</ref> The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte Augusta]], compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in ''disposition'', that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 289\u201390; emphasis in original.</ref>\n\nAfter reading ''Pride and Prejudice'', playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read.<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 318.</ref> [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Anne Milbanke]], future wife of the [[Romantic Poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Lord Byron]], wrote: \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most ''probable'' fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\".<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 318\u201319; emphasis in original.</ref> The Dowager [[George Venables-Vernon, 2nd Baron Vernon|Lady Vernon]] told a friend that ''Mansfield Park'' was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"\u2014as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\"<ref name=\"Qtd347\">Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 347.</ref> Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist [[Maria Edgeworth]], that \"[''Mansfield Park''] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".<ref name=\"Qtd347\" />\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime:<ref>Fergus, 18.</ref> two for ''Sense and Sensibility'', three for ''Pride and Prejudice'', none for ''Mansfield Park'', and seven for ''Emma''. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious.<ref>Fergus, 18\u201319; Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 287\u201389, 316\u201317, 372\u201373; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 1.</ref> They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels.<ref>Waldron, 83\u201391.</ref> Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\".<ref>Southam, Vol. 1, 6.</ref> This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher [[John Murray (1778\u20131843)|John Murray]] to review ''Emma'', famed historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''. Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the {{nowrap|reader ... a}} correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\".<ref>Scott, 58; see also Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 110; Waldron, 85\u201386; Duffy, 94\u201396.</ref> Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\".<ref>Galperin, 96.</ref> Scott wrote in [[The Journal of Sir Walter Scott|his private journal]] in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n{{quote\n| Also read again, and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of ''Pride and Prejudice''.

The reviewer for the ''British Critic'' felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on [[Literary realism|realism]] was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the ''Edinburgh Review'' disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots.<ref>Waldron, 89.</ref> Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels\u2014for example, they misunderstood her use of [[irony]]. Reviewers reduced ''Sense and Sensibility'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.<ref>Waldron, 84\u201385, 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1821, the English writer and theologian [[Richard Whately]] published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waldron, 89\u201390; Duffy, 97; Watt, 4\u20135.</ref> Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's {{sic}} great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female {{nowrap|characters. ...}} Her heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\"<ref>Southam, \"Whately on Jane Austen\", Vol. 1, 100\u201301.</ref> No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the [[Victorian era]]'s view of Austen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== 1821\u20131870: Cultured few ==\n[[File:PSM V09 D668 George Henry Lewes.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Henry Lewes]], partner of [[George Eliot]], compared Austen to Shakespeare.|alt=Drawing of man, showing head and shoulders.

In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of {{nowrap|art ... the}} easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 152; see also, Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 20\u201321.</ref> Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment.

Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967.<ref name=\"CossySaglia169\">Cossy and Saglia, 169.</ref> Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the [[English novel]] tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected [[sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]] into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 170.</ref>\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in [[continental Europe]] than in Britain.<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 169\u201370.</ref>  In  Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique's ''Pride and Prejudice'', for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones.<ref name=\"CossySaglia171\">Cossy and Saglia, 171.</ref> Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\".<ref name=\"CossySaglia171\" /> Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 174.</ref> German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.<ref name=\"CossySaglia178\">Cossy and Saglia, 178.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isabelle de Montolieu.jpg|thumb|[[Isabelle de Montolieu]] translated Austen's works into French.|alt=Engraving of woman, showing her head and shoulders.

In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh.<ref>The ''Memoir'' was published in December 1869 and dated 1870.</ref> With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically.<ref>The ''Memoir'' was written by Austen-Leigh with the assistance and cooperation of his older sister, Anna, and his younger sister, Caroline, both of whom had known Austen and contributed written reminiscences.

James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] public.<ref>Kirkham, 76.</ref> The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of ''Memoir'' is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the ''Memoir'' spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883\u2014a cheap [[wikt:sixpence|sixpenny]] series published by [[Routledge]]. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 58\u201362.</ref> However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 102\u201303; see also Watt, 6; Johnson, 211; Trott, 92\u201394.</ref> Yet, after the publication of the ''Memoir'', more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters&nbsp;\u2013 A Family Record''. Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\".<ref>Honan, \"Biographies\", 19.</ref> Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the ''Memoir'', they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them.

He is looking off to the right.]]\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the ''Life of Jane Austen'', initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 34, 45; Trott, 92\u201393.</ref> According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\n{{quote\n| We see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface 'finish'; for the realism of their fictional world, the variety and vitality of their characters; for their pervasive humour; and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery. The novels are prized for their 'perfection'. Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection, achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 13\u201314.</ref>\n}}\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]], [[Margaret Oliphant]], and [[Leslie Stephen]]. In a review of the ''Memoir'', Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\n{{quote\n| began by being an ironical critic; she manifested her {{nowrap|judgment ... not}} by direct censure, but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her {{nowrap|models. ... Criticism}}, humour, irony, the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks, are her characteristics.<ref>Qtd. in Watt, 5\u20136.</ref>\n}}\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until [[Lionel Trilling]] quoted it in 1957.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 17.</ref> Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\".<ref>Qtd. in Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 102\u201303.</ref> This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of [[feminist literary criticism]].\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in [[bowdlerised]] editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 49\u201350.</ref> As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\".<ref name=\"Southam52\">Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 52.</ref> Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the [[frontier]] themes that had come to define American literature.<ref name=\"Southam52\" /> By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic [[William Dean Howells]] and the writer and humourist [[Mark Twain]]. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]] tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 74.</ref> In his book ''Following the Equator'', Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's {{nowrap|books ... are}} absent from this library.

The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\".<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 33.</ref> Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 69\u201370.</ref> The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the ''Memoir'' and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', that of \"dear aunt Jane\".<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 25\u201330, 72; Fergus, 13.</ref> Author and critic [[Leslie Stephen]] described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 47.</ref>\u2014it was only after the publication of the ''Memoir'' that readers developed a personal connection with Austen.<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 112.</ref> However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as ''[[Janeite]]s'' to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.<ref>Trott, 94; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 46; Johnson, 213.</ref>\n\nAmerican novelist [[Henry James]], one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], and [[Henry Fielding]] as among \"the fine painters of life\".<ref>Watt, 7.</ref> But James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\".<ref>Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 103.</ref> In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the {{nowrap|commercial, ... the}} special bookselling {{nowrap|spirits. ... the}} body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear', our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"<ref>Watt, 7\u20138; see also Southam, \"Janeites and Anti-Janeites\", 240.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer [[Reginald Farrer]] published a lengthy essay in the ''Quarterly Review'' which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction.<ref>Litz, ''Jane Austen'', 39.</ref> Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 92\u201393.</ref> Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\".<ref>Qtd. in Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 107.</ref> Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism 1870\u20131940\", 106\u201307; Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 112.</ref>\n\n== 1930\u20132000: Modern scholarship ==\n[[File:ChapmanAustenTitlePage.jpg|left|thumb|Austen was the first English novelist whose works were published in a scholarly edition.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 99\u2013100.</ref>|alt=Title page reads \"The Novels of Jane Austen, The Text based on Collation of the Early Editions by R. W. Chapman, With Notes Indexes and Illustrations from Contemporary Sources, In Five Volumes, Volume I, Oxford, At the Clarendon Press, 1923]]\n\nSeveral important early works\u2014glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship\u2014paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Shakespearean scholar [[Andrew Cecil Bradley|A. C. Bradley's]] 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\".<ref>Brian Southam, quoted in Trott, 92; see also, Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79.</ref> Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer [[Samuel Johnson]], arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79; see also Watt, 10; Trott, 93.</ref> Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79.</ref> The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]], whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 99\u2013100; see also Watt, 10\u201311; Gilson, 149\u201350; Johnson, 218.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist [[E. M. Forster]] primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of [[Mary Lascelles (literary scholar)|Mary Lascelles']] ''Jane Austen and Her Art''\u2014\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen\u2014that the academic study of her works matured.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Trott, 93; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 107\u201309, 124.</ref> Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\".<ref>Lascelles, vii.</ref> She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class.<ref name=\"Irvine, 94\">Irvine, 94.</ref>  Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric\u2014a debate that continued into the 21st century.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism 1870\u20131940\", 108; Watt, 10\u201311; Stovel, 233; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 127; Todd, 20.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dr-Johnson.jpg|thumb|Modern scholars emphasised Austen's intellectual and artistic ties to important 18th-century figures such as [[Samuel Johnson]].|alt=Half-length portrait of man wearing white wig and brown 18th-century suit. He is rotund and holding his left arm in front of him.]]\n\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the ''status quo'' but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected.<ref name=\"LitzCriticism\">Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 112; Stovel, 233.</ref> In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked\".<ref>Irvine, 92.</ref> Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that in its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single women is seen as a problem.<ref name=\"Irvine, 93\">Irvine, 93.</ref> Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works.<ref name=\"Irvine, 93\"/> Almost simultaneously, influential critic [[Q. D. Leavis]] argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'' in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 129\u201331.</ref> Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in ''Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery'' (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be.<ref name=\"LitzCriticism\" /> These revisionist views, together with prominent critic [[F. R. Leavis]]'s pronouncement in ''The Great Tradition'' (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by [[Ian Watt]], who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the [[genre]] of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics.<ref>Johnson, 219; Todd. 20.</ref> They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry Fielding]]'s and [[Samuel Richardson]]'s<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".<ref>Todd, 20.</ref>\n\nThe period after the [[Second World War]] saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without any study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in.<ref name=\"Irvine, 94\"/> The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literary skills at combining irony and paradox. But others said that New Criticism's focus on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored their message, and reduced Austen to merely the scribe of these books that they admired so much.<ref>Irvine, 94\u201395.</ref> More typical of the post-1945 scholarship is Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book ''Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery'', where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.<ref>Irvine, 97.</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his ''Introduction to the English Novel'' praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing that a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote.<ref>Irvine, 114.</ref> About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on ''Mansfield Park'' wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\".<ref>Irvine, 108\u201309.</ref> In his 1957 essay \"''Emma'' and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on an individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\", as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\".<ref>Irvine, 107\u201308.</ref> Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.<ref>Irvine, 108.</ref>\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book ''The Rise of the Novel'' argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse.<ref>Irvine, 97\u201398.</ref> Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book ''The Rhetoric of Fiction'', in which he offered a detailed study of ''Emma'', which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator.<ref name=\"Irvine, 95\">Irvine, 95</ref> Booth argued that Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader.<ref>Irvine, 95.</ref> Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since.<ref name=\"Irvine, 95\"/> Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in ''Emma'' is related to the diction of the characters, with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character.<ref>Irvine, 99</ref> A. Walton Ktiz argued that the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of ''Emma'' from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand Emma mind without becoming limited by it.<ref>Irvine, 99.</ref>\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the ''Bildungsroman'' (novel of education).<ref name=\"Irvine, 101\">Irvine, 101</ref> D. D. Devlin in ''Jane Austen and Education'' (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways ''Bildungsroman'', where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change.<ref name=\"Irvine, 101\"/> The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book ''The Way of the World''  called ''Pride and Prejudice'' a \"classic\" ''Bildungsroman'', where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that \"she does not err due to a lack of criticism, but due to an excess, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust ''a priori''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\">Irvine, 102</ref> Moretti argued that a typical ''Bildungsroman'' of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book ''The Historicity of Romantic Discourse'' argued that all of Austen's books were ''Bildungsroman'', where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel ''Joseph Andrews'', that a young man working as humble servant, goes through much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he was a baby.<ref name=\"Irvine, 103\">Irvine, 103</ref> By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable strokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict.<ref name=\"Irvine, 103\"/> Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of ''Bildungsroman'' are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories.<ref>Irvine, 104.</ref> For Susan Fraiman, ''Pride and Prejudice'' is both a ''Bildungsroman'' concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where she ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\">Irvine, 105.</ref> Critics are badly divided over the question of whether the marriages of Austen's heroines are meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth, or merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\"/> [[Stuart Tave]] wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\"/>\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book ''Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form'' challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\">Irvine, 115.</ref> Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was ''Persuasion'' where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry; only marriage to the [[self-made man]] Captain Wentworth can give her happiness.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> Brown argued that ''Persuasion'' was in many ways the darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Luk\u00e1cs, especially his 1920 book ''The Theory of the Novel''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/>\n\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious arguments has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of {{nowrap|patriarchy ... some}} critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\"<ref>Kelly, 156.</ref> In ''Jane Austen and the War of Ideas'' (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, [[Marilyn Butler]] argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in ''The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels'' (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"[[estate (house)|estate]]\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations.<ref>Todd, 34.</ref> Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work.<ref>Irvine, 116.</ref> Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character.<ref>Irvine, 116\u201317.</ref> Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\">Irvine, 117.</ref> Butler argued that a novel like ''Sense and Sensibility'', where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\"/> Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\"/> Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative&nbsp;... is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole{{'\"}}.<ref>Irvine, 117</ref> Irvine wrote that a novel like ''Sense and Sensibility'' appears to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like ''Pride and Prejudice'' does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.<ref>Irvine, 118</ref>\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 ''After Virtue'' offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society.<ref name=\"Irvine, 106\">Irvine, 106</ref> In this regard, MacIntyre used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous, with the English country estate playing the same role that the ''polis'' did for Aristotle.<ref name=\"Irvine, 106\"/> By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book ''Jane Austen and the State'' depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Irvine, 121\">Irvine, 121</ref> In her 1987 book ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'', Nancy Armstrong, in a study much influenced by the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Michel Foucault]], argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not.<ref>Irvine, 122</ref> The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book ''Between Self and the World'' likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 121\"/> By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's ''Emma''\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role.<ref>Irvine, 119.</ref> David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of [[Adam Smith]], who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather than in the public sphere of politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 120\">Irvine, 120</ref> Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by [[Edmund Burke]], arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical.<ref name=\"Irvine, 120\"/> Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of ''Sense and Sensibility'' was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money.<ref>Irvine, 120.</ref>  As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".<ref>Rajan, 101.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 24em\n| align = left\n| quote = [I]n all her novels Austen examines the female powerlessness that underlies monetary pressure to marry, the injustice of inheritance laws, the ignorance of women denied formal education, the psychological vulnerability of the heiress or widow, the exploited dependency of the spinster, the boredom of the lady provided with no vocation.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2013 [[Sandra Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar|Gubar]], ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'' (1979)<ref>Gilbert and Gubar, 136.</ref>\n| style = padding:2.0em\n| fontsize=95%\n}}\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]]'s seminal ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'' (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other [[feminist literary criticism|feminist criticism]] of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a ''woman'' writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in ''Mansfield Park'', Lady Catherine de Bourgh in ''Pride and Prejudice'' and Mrs. Churchill in ''Emma'' were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, who are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels, while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society.<ref>Irvine, 125.</ref> The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's writings, though most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did.<ref name=\"Irvine, 126\">Irvine, 126.</ref> Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed.<ref name=\"Irvine, 126\"/> The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time.<ref>Rajan, 102.</ref> Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's ''Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form'' (1979), Margaret Kirkham's ''Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction'' (1983), and [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia L. Johnson's]] ''Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel'' (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative{{'\"}}.<ref>Rajan, 103.</ref> Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing that women were just as capable of being rational as men, that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft.<ref>Irvine 128.</ref> Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.<ref>Todd, 33; Rajan, 102\u201303.</ref>\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as [[Jane West]], [[Hannah More]], and [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]] to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by [[conduct book]]s, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French.<ref>Irvine 34\u201335.</ref> Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony.<ref>Irvine 130.</ref> In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in ''Sense and Sensibility'' that the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in ''Mansfield Park'' the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and ''Northanger Abbey'' where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man.<ref>Irvine 130\u201331.</ref> Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in ''Mansfield Park'' is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers.<ref>Irvine 131.</ref> Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy.<ref>Irvine 132.</ref> Irvine, in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham, argued that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society, with her villains failing to live up to the standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system.<ref>Irvine 129.</ref> Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote that for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whether this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power.<ref name=\"Irvine, 133\">Irvine, 133.</ref> Irvine argued it was just as possible to see ''Emma'' as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 133\"/> Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivine used to argue that while ''Pride and Prejudice'' does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.<ref>Irvine, 134.</ref>\n\nMany scholars have noted \"modesty\" in the \"conduct books\" that were very popular for setting out the proper rules for young ladies. In Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\">Irvine 126.</ref> Modesty meant that a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet; modesty also meant that a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\"/> This double meaning meant that a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she was attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\"/> Jan Fergus argued that for this reason,  Austen's books were subversive, engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\">Irvine 127.</ref> In the same way, Kirkham used ''Mansfield Park'' as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books, while, at the same time, rejecting the enfantisisation of women promoted by the conduct books, she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit.<ref>Irvine, 128\u201329.</ref> Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while, at the same time, undercutting such expectations.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\"/> Devoney Looser in the 1995 book ''Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism'' argued in her introduction that there were a number of ways in which Austen could be placed, not merely within a feminist tradition, but as herself a feminist.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\"/>\n\nUsing the theories of [[Michel Foucault]] as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay, {{\"'}}The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in ''Emma''\", argued that the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Foucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation.<ref>Irvine, 99\u2013100</ref> Finch and Bowen argued that the voice of the omnipresent narrator, together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in ''Emma,'' were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character. Seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind, persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment, all the while fooling her into thinking she was in love.<ref>Irvine, 100</ref> By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in ''Sense and Sensibility'' was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between \"psychology\" and \"character\" since Dashwood must be the observer of her character, and used what she has learned to grow.<ref>Irvine, 104</ref>\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic [[Tony Tanner (scholar)|Tony Tanner]]'s \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place.<ref>Irvine 111.</ref> Sedgwick argued that the way the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate, and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\">Irvine 111\u201312.</ref> Sedgwick says that the way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\"/> Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone.<ref name=\"Irvine 112\">Irvine 112.</ref> Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"[[culture war]]\" between liberals and conservatives.<ref name=\"Irvine 112\"/>\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England.<ref>Irvine pp. 145\u201346</ref> Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\".<ref>Irvine pp. 146\u201347</ref> According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance&nbsp;... the ''feel'' of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated from her language is still&nbsp;... peculiarly English\".<ref>Irvine p.146</ref> Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 ''Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity'' is full of historical errors such as his claim that Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\">Irvine p. 147</ref> Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed, or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time.<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\"/> Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\"/>\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist criticism]] dominated Austen studies.<ref>Todd, 34\u201335.</ref> Generating heated debate, [[Edward Said]] devoted a chapter of his book ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993) to ''Mansfield Park'', arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether ''Mansfield Park'' justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial.<ref>Irvine pp. 135\u201337</ref> The debate about ''Mansfield Park'' and slavery is the one issue in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention.<ref>Irvine p.135</ref> Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and take up Said's thesis about ''Mansfield Park'' reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire.<ref>Irvine pp. 135\u201336</ref> Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay {{\"'}}What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' ''Mansfield Park'''s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the [[Haitian revolution]], which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, and was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\">Irvine p. 137</ref> Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based on a set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book ''Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions'' argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time, with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Stewart linked these concerns to ''Mansfield Park'', writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/>\n\nOther critics have seen the message of ''Mansfield Park'' as abolitionist.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford was \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in ''Mansfield Park'' and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous to his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park that he finds after he returns to England.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in ''Mansfield Park'' \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather is used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which led to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies.<ref name=\"Irvine p.138\">Irvine p. 138</ref> Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that the much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chose to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"Irvine p.138\"/> Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel, that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park came from the plantation in Antigua.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\">Irvine p. 139</ref> John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that the parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric, not as literal, and that Sir Thomas' willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean, suggested that he be understood as a good master.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\"/> In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in ''Mansfield Park''.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\"/>\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off on adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\">Irvine p. 142</ref> Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in ''Persuasion''; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in ''Mansfield Park''; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in ''Sense and Sensibility''.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domesticate otherwise scarred men, noting for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793\u201398, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood, by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne, is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British Empire; arguing instead in Austen's works that the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/>\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France.<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\">Irvine, 143.</ref> Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of England defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\"/> Mee suggested that in ''Emma'', the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France.<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\"/> Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book ''British Fiction and the Production of Social Order'' argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England.<ref>Irvine, 144\u201345.</ref> In this regard, Janet Sorenson in ''The Grammar of Empire'' noted that in Austen's books, no characters speak in [[Nonstandard dialect|dialect]], and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.<ref>Irvine, 145.</ref>\n\nIn ''Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health{{'}}'', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body.<ref>Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 113\u201317; Stovel, 234\u201338; Rajan, 101\u201309.</ref> There has also been a return to considerations of [[aesthetics]] with [[D. A. Miller]]'s ''Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style'' (2003), which connects artistic concerns with [[queer theory]].<ref>Todd, 35.</ref> Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, when he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\"/> Miller answered that it was because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.<ref>Irvine 110</ref>\n\n== Modern popular culture ==\n{{see also|Jane Austen in popular culture}}\n\n=== Modern Janeites ===\n[[File:Jane Austen Centre.jpg|thumb|The [[Jane Austen Centre]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], a place of [[pilgrimage]] for [[Janeite]]s<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 116.</ref>|alt=Photograph of a building decorated with Jane Austen posters and paraphernalia, including a mannequin dressed in early 19th-century clothing.]]\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\".<ref name=\"Johnson, 211\" /> Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs.<ref>Johnson, 223.</ref> Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious [[pilgrim]]s with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\".<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 113\u201317.</ref> The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to [[Trekkie]]s, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while ''Star Trek'' can only claim to be a part of popular culture.<ref>Johnson, 224.</ref>\n\n=== Adaptations ===\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel ''Virtues and Vices'' (1981) and fantasy novel ''Resolve and Resistance'' (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works.<ref name=\"Lynch160\">Lynch, \"Sequels\", 160.</ref> According to Lynch, \"her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist\".<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 162.</ref> Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\".<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 163.</ref> The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\".<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 164\u201365.</ref> Those that emphasise [[nostalgia]] are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of [[postmodern]] playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:Greer Garson in Pride and Prejudice.JPG|left|thumb|[[Greer Garson]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]] in the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 ''Pride and Prejudice'']], the first feature film adaptation of the novel|alt=Black-and-white still of a woman gazing upwards, wearing an off-the shoulder dress, a prominent necklace, and a bow in her dark hair.]]\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared.<ref name=\"troogree2\">Troost and Greenfield, \"Introduction\", 2.</ref> The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] production of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]].

[[Jane Austen]] (1775\u20131817), the author of such works as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read [[novelist]]s in the English language.<ref>Clark, Robert. \"[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5167 Jane Austen]\". ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' (subscription only). 8 January 2001. Retrieved 24 August 2008.</ref> Her novels are the subject of intense [[Literary theory|scholarly study]] and the centre of a diverse [[fandom|fan culture]].\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable, but received only a few [[Literary criticism|reviews]], albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard [[Richard Bentley (publisher)#Standard Novels series|Bentley's Standard Novels series]], which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.<ref>Looser, Devoney. ''The Making of Jane Austen''. 19\u201322.</ref>\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen|Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality\u2014dear aunt Jane\u2014and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up\u2014some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"\u2014but all claiming to be the true [[Janeite]]s, or those who properly appreciated her. The \"teeming masses\", meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honouring Austen, including in [[Amateur theatre|amateur theatricals]] in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.<ref>Looser, Devoney. ''The Making of Jane Austen''. 83\u201397.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]] prepared a carefully edited collection of her works, which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted within academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical. With the growing professionalisation of university [[English studies|English departments]] in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works. As of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 film ''Pride and Prejudice'']] and evolved to include productions such as the 2004 [[Bollywood]]-style film ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]''.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''Pride and Prejudice'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Jane Austen}}\n[[File:Houghton EC8 Au747 811s (B) - Sense and Sensibility.jpg|thumb|left|Austen signed her first published novel \"By a Lady\".|alt=Title page reads \"Sense and Sensibility: A Novel.

During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the [[epistolary novel]] which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park (novel)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously.<ref>Fergus, 13\u201314.</ref> Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an [[open secret]] among the [[British nobility|aristocracy]].<ref>Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 225.</ref> During one of her visits to London, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] invited her, through his librarian, [[James Stanier Clarke]], to view his library at [[Carlton House]]; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\".<ref>Qtd. in Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 226; also see [http://www.janeausten.co.uk/james-stanier-clarke-librarian-to-the-prince-of-wales/ Jane Austen to J. S.

Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.<ref>Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 227.</ref>\n\n[[File:JaneAustenCassandraWatercolour.jpg|thumb|upright|A watercolour sketch of [[Jane Austen]] by her sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]] (c.&nbsp;1804)|alt=A sketch of a woman from the back sitting beneath a tree and wearing early 19th-century clothing and a bonnet]]\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817), wrote ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see ''Northanger Abbey'' or ''Persuasion'' through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death, and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\".<ref>Le Faye, \"Memoirs and biographies\", 51.</ref> This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives&nbsp;...

[[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough|Lady Bessborough]], sister to the notorious [[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]], commented on ''Sense and Sensibility'' in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel. &nbsp;...&nbsp;tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\"<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 7.</ref> The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte Augusta]], compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in ''disposition'', that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 289\u201390; emphasis in original.</ref>\n\nAfter reading ''Pride and Prejudice'', playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read.<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 318.</ref> [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Anne Milbanke]], future wife of the [[Romantic Poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Lord Byron]], wrote: \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most ''probable'' fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\".<ref>Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 318\u201319; emphasis in original.</ref> The Dowager [[George Venables-Vernon, 2nd Baron Vernon|Lady Vernon]] told a friend that ''Mansfield Park'' was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"\u2014as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\"<ref name=\"Qtd347\">Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 347.</ref> Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist [[Maria Edgeworth]], that \"[''Mansfield Park''] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".<ref name=\"Qtd347\" />\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime:<ref>Fergus, 18.</ref> two for ''Sense and Sensibility'', three for ''Pride and Prejudice'', none for ''Mansfield Park'', and seven for ''Emma''. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious.<ref>Fergus, 18\u201319; Honan, ''Jane Austen'', 287\u201389, 316\u201317, 372\u201373; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 1.</ref> They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels.<ref>Waldron, 83\u201391.</ref> Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\".<ref>Southam, Vol. 1, 6.</ref> This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher [[John Murray (1778\u20131843)|John Murray]] to review ''Emma'', famed historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''. Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the {{nowrap|reader ... a}} correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\".<ref>Scott, 58; see also Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 110; Waldron, 85\u201386; Duffy, 94\u201396.</ref> Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\".<ref>Galperin, 96.</ref> Scott wrote in [[The Journal of Sir Walter Scott|his private journal]] in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n{{quote\n| Also read again, and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of ''Pride and Prejudice''.

The reviewer for the ''British Critic'' felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on [[Literary realism|realism]] was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the ''Edinburgh Review'' disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots.<ref>Waldron, 89.</ref> Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels\u2014for example, they misunderstood her use of [[irony]]. Reviewers reduced ''Sense and Sensibility'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.<ref>Waldron, 84\u201385, 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1821, the English writer and theologian [[Richard Whately]] published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waldron, 89\u201390; Duffy, 97; Watt, 4\u20135.</ref> Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's {{sic}} great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female {{nowrap|characters. ...}} Her heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\"<ref>Southam, \"Whately on Jane Austen\", Vol. 1, 100\u201301.</ref> No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the [[Victorian era]]'s view of Austen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== 1821\u20131870: Cultured few ==\n[[File:PSM V09 D668 George Henry Lewes.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Henry Lewes]], partner of [[George Eliot]], compared Austen to Shakespeare.|alt=Drawing of man, showing head and shoulders.

This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Duffy, 98\u201399.</ref> Philosopher and literary critic [[George Henry Lewes]] articulated this theme in a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of {{nowrap|art ... the}} easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 152; see also, Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 20\u201321.</ref> Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama.\"<ref>Lewes, 158.</ref>\n\nReacting against Lewes's essays and his personal communications with her, novelist [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] admired Austen's fidelity to everyday life but described her as \"only shrewd and observant\" and criticised the absence of visible passion in her work.<ref>Bront\u00eb, 128.</ref> To Bront\u00eb, Austen's work appeared formal and constrained, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".<ref>Bront\u00eb, 126.</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== 19th-century European translations ==\nAusten's novels appeared in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of ''Pride and Prejudice'' in the journal ''[[Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique]]'', quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967.<ref name=\"CossySaglia169\">Cossy and Saglia, 169.</ref> Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the [[English novel]] tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected [[sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]] into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 170.</ref>\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in [[continental Europe]] than in Britain.<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 169\u201370.</ref>  In  Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique's ''Pride and Prejudice'', for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones.<ref name=\"CossySaglia171\">Cossy and Saglia, 171.</ref> Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\".<ref name=\"CossySaglia171\" /> Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].<ref>Cossy and Saglia, 174.</ref> German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.<ref name=\"CossySaglia178\">Cossy and Saglia, 178.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isabelle de Montolieu.jpg|thumb|[[Isabelle de Montolieu]] translated Austen's works into French.|alt=Engraving of woman, showing her head and shoulders.

In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh.<ref>The ''Memoir'' was published in December 1869 and dated 1870.</ref> With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically.<ref>The ''Memoir'' was written by Austen-Leigh with the assistance and cooperation of his older sister, Anna, and his younger sister, Caroline, both of whom had known Austen and contributed written reminiscences. Le Faye, \"Memoirs and biographies\", 52\u201354; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 1\u20132.</ref> Readers of the ''Memoir'' were presented with the myth of the amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces: the ''Memoir'' fixed in the public mind a sentimental picture of Austen as a quiet, middle-aged maiden aunt and reassured them that her work was suitable for a respectable [[Victorian era|Victorian]] family. James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] public.<ref>Kirkham, 76.</ref> The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of ''Memoir'' is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the ''Memoir'' spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883\u2014a cheap [[wikt:sixpence|sixpenny]] series published by [[Routledge]]. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 58\u201362.</ref> However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 102\u201303; see also Watt, 6; Johnson, 211; Trott, 92\u201394.</ref> Yet, after the publication of the ''Memoir'', more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters&nbsp;\u2013 A Family Record''. Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\".<ref>Honan, \"Biographies\", 19.</ref> Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the ''Memoir'', they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them.

He is looking off to the right.]]\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the ''Life of Jane Austen'', initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 34, 45; Trott, 92\u201393.</ref> According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\n{{quote\n| We see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface 'finish'; for the realism of their fictional world, the variety and vitality of their characters; for their pervasive humour; and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery. The novels are prized for their 'perfection'. Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection, achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 13\u201314.</ref>\n}}\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]], [[Margaret Oliphant]], and [[Leslie Stephen]]. In a review of the ''Memoir'', Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\n{{quote\n| began by being an ironical critic; she manifested her {{nowrap|judgment ... not}} by direct censure, but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her {{nowrap|models. ... Criticism}}, humour, irony, the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks, are her characteristics.<ref>Qtd. in Watt, 5\u20136.</ref>\n}}\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until [[Lionel Trilling]] quoted it in 1957.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 17.</ref> Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\".<ref>Qtd. in Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 102\u201303.</ref> This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of [[feminist literary criticism]].\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in [[bowdlerised]] editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 49\u201350.</ref> As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\".<ref name=\"Southam52\">Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 52.</ref> Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the [[frontier]] themes that had come to define American literature.<ref name=\"Southam52\" /> By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic [[William Dean Howells]] and the writer and humourist [[Mark Twain]]. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]] tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 74.</ref> In his book ''Following the Equator'', Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's {{nowrap|books ... are}} absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"<ref>Twain, 232.</ref>\n\n=== Janeites ===\n{{quote box\n| width = 24em\n| quote = Might we {{nowrap|not ... borrow}} from Miss Austen's biographer the title which the affection of a nephew bestows upon her, and recognise her officially as 'dear aunt Jane'?\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2013 [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]]<ref>Simpson, 265.</ref>\n| style = padding:2.0em\n| fontsize=95%\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'s'' changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\".<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 33.</ref> Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 69\u201370.</ref> The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the ''Memoir'' and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', that of \"dear aunt Jane\".<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 25\u201330, 72; Fergus, 13.</ref> Author and critic [[Leslie Stephen]] described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 47.</ref>\u2014it was only after the publication of the ''Memoir'' that readers developed a personal connection with Austen.<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 112.</ref> However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as ''[[Janeite]]s'' to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.<ref>Trott, 94; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 46; Johnson, 213.</ref>\n\nAmerican novelist [[Henry James]], one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], and [[Henry Fielding]] as among \"the fine painters of life\".<ref>Watt, 7.</ref> But James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\".<ref>Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 103.</ref> In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the {{nowrap|commercial, ... the}} special bookselling {{nowrap|spirits. ... the}} body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear', our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"<ref>Watt, 7\u20138; see also Southam, \"Janeites and Anti-Janeites\", 240.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer [[Reginald Farrer]] published a lengthy essay in the ''Quarterly Review'' which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction.<ref>Litz, ''Jane Austen'', 39.</ref> Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 92\u201393.</ref> Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\".<ref>Qtd. in Southam, \"Criticism, 1870\u20131940\", 107.</ref> Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism 1870\u20131940\", 106\u201307; Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 112.</ref>\n\n== 1930\u20132000: Modern scholarship ==\n[[File:ChapmanAustenTitlePage.jpg|left|thumb|Austen was the first English novelist whose works were published in a scholarly edition.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 99\u2013100.</ref>|alt=Title page reads \"The Novels of Jane Austen, The Text based on Collation of the Early Editions by R. W. Chapman, With Notes Indexes and Illustrations from Contemporary Sources, In Five Volumes, Volume I, Oxford, At the Clarendon Press, 1923]]\n\nSeveral important early works\u2014glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship\u2014paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Shakespearean scholar [[Andrew Cecil Bradley|A. C. Bradley's]] 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\".<ref>Brian Southam, quoted in Trott, 92; see also, Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79.</ref> Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer [[Samuel Johnson]], arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79; see also Watt, 10; Trott, 93.</ref> Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 79.</ref> The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]], whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 99\u2013100; see also Watt, 10\u201311; Gilson, 149\u201350; Johnson, 218.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist [[E. M. Forster]] primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of [[Mary Lascelles (literary scholar)|Mary Lascelles']] ''Jane Austen and Her Art''\u2014\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen\u2014that the academic study of her works matured.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Trott, 93; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 107\u201309, 124.</ref> Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\".<ref>Lascelles, vii.</ref> She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class.<ref name=\"Irvine, 94\">Irvine, 94.</ref>  Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric\u2014a debate that continued into the 21st century.<ref>Southam, \"Criticism 1870\u20131940\", 108; Watt, 10\u201311; Stovel, 233; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 127; Todd, 20.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dr-Johnson.jpg|thumb|Modern scholars emphasised Austen's intellectual and artistic ties to important 18th-century figures such as [[Samuel Johnson]].|alt=Half-length portrait of man wearing white wig and brown 18th-century suit. He is rotund and holding his left arm in front of him.]]\n\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the ''status quo'' but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected.<ref name=\"LitzCriticism\">Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 112; Stovel, 233.</ref> In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked\".<ref>Irvine, 92.</ref> Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that in its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single women is seen as a problem.<ref name=\"Irvine, 93\">Irvine, 93.</ref> Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works.<ref name=\"Irvine, 93\"/> Almost simultaneously, influential critic [[Q. D. Leavis]] argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'' in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer.<ref>Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 129\u201331.</ref> Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in ''Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery'' (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be.<ref name=\"LitzCriticism\" /> These revisionist views, together with prominent critic [[F. R. Leavis]]'s pronouncement in ''The Great Tradition'' (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by [[Ian Watt]], who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the [[genre]] of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics.<ref>Johnson, 219; Todd. 20.</ref> They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry Fielding]]'s and [[Samuel Richardson]]'s<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".<ref>Todd, 20.</ref>\n\nThe period after the [[Second World War]] saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without any study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in.<ref name=\"Irvine, 94\"/> The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literary skills at combining irony and paradox. But others said that New Criticism's focus on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored their message, and reduced Austen to merely the scribe of these books that they admired so much.<ref>Irvine, 94\u201395.</ref> More typical of the post-1945 scholarship is Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book ''Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery'', where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.<ref>Irvine, 97.</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his ''Introduction to the English Novel'' praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing that a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote.<ref>Irvine, 114.</ref> About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on ''Mansfield Park'' wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\".<ref>Irvine, 108\u201309.</ref> In his 1957 essay \"''Emma'' and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on an individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\", as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\".<ref>Irvine, 107\u201308.</ref> Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.<ref>Irvine, 108.</ref>\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book ''The Rise of the Novel'' argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse.<ref>Irvine, 97\u201398.</ref> Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book ''The Rhetoric of Fiction'', in which he offered a detailed study of ''Emma'', which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator.<ref name=\"Irvine, 95\">Irvine, 95</ref> Booth argued that Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader.<ref>Irvine, 95.</ref> Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since.<ref name=\"Irvine, 95\"/> Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in ''Emma'' is related to the diction of the characters, with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character.<ref>Irvine, 99</ref> A. Walton Ktiz argued that the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of ''Emma'' from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand Emma mind without becoming limited by it.<ref>Irvine, 99.</ref>\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the ''Bildungsroman'' (novel of education).<ref name=\"Irvine, 101\">Irvine, 101</ref> D. D. Devlin in ''Jane Austen and Education'' (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways ''Bildungsroman'', where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change.<ref name=\"Irvine, 101\"/> The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book ''The Way of the World''  called ''Pride and Prejudice'' a \"classic\" ''Bildungsroman'', where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that \"she does not err due to a lack of criticism, but due to an excess, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust ''a priori''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\">Irvine, 102</ref> Moretti argued that a typical ''Bildungsroman'' of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book ''The Historicity of Romantic Discourse'' argued that all of Austen's books were ''Bildungsroman'', where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 102\"/> Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel ''Joseph Andrews'', that a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he was a baby.<ref name=\"Irvine, 103\">Irvine, 103</ref> By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable strokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict.<ref name=\"Irvine, 103\"/> Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of ''Bildungsroman'' are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories.<ref>Irvine, 104.</ref> For Susan Fraiman, ''Pride and Prejudice'' is both a ''Bildungsroman'' concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where she ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\">Irvine, 105.</ref> Critics are badly divided over the question of whether the marriages of Austen's heroines are meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth, or merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\"/> [[Stuart Tave]] wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.<ref name=\"Irvine, 105\"/>\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book ''Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form'' challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\">Irvine, 115.</ref> Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was ''Persuasion'' where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry; only marriage to the [[self-made man]] Captain Wentworth can give her happiness.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> Brown argued that ''Persuasion'' was in many ways the darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/> Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Luk\u00e1cs, especially his 1920 book ''The Theory of the Novel''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 115\"/>\n\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious arguments has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of {{nowrap|patriarchy ... some}} critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\"<ref>Kelly, 156.</ref> In ''Jane Austen and the War of Ideas'' (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, [[Marilyn Butler]] argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in ''The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels'' (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"[[estate (house)|estate]]\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations.<ref>Todd, 34.</ref> Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work.<ref>Irvine, 116.</ref> Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character.<ref>Irvine, 116\u201317.</ref> Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\">Irvine, 117.</ref> Butler argued that a novel like ''Sense and Sensibility'', where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\"/> Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 117\"/> Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative&nbsp;... is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole{{'\"}}.<ref>Irvine, 117</ref> Irvine wrote that a novel like ''Sense and Sensibility'' appears to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like ''Pride and Prejudice'' does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.<ref>Irvine, 118</ref>\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 ''After Virtue'' offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society.<ref name=\"Irvine, 106\">Irvine, 106</ref> In this regard, MacIntyre used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous, with the English country estate playing the same role that the ''polis'' did for Aristotle.<ref name=\"Irvine, 106\"/> By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book ''Jane Austen and the State'' depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Irvine, 121\">Irvine, 121</ref> In her 1987 book ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'', Nancy Armstrong, in a study much influenced by the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Michel Foucault]], argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not.<ref>Irvine, 122</ref> The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book ''Between Self and the World'' likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism.<ref name=\"Irvine, 121\"/> By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's ''Emma''\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role.<ref>Irvine, 119.</ref> David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of [[Adam Smith]], who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather than in the public sphere of politics.<ref name=\"Irvine, 120\">Irvine, 120</ref> Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by [[Edmund Burke]], arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical.<ref name=\"Irvine, 120\"/> Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of ''Sense and Sensibility'' was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money.<ref>Irvine, 120.</ref>  As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".<ref>Rajan, 101.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 24em\n| align = left\n| quote = [I]n all her novels Austen examines the female powerlessness that underlies monetary pressure to marry, the injustice of inheritance laws, the ignorance of women denied formal education, the psychological vulnerability of the heiress or widow, the exploited dependency of the spinster, the boredom of the lady provided with no vocation.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2013 [[Sandra Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar|Gubar]], ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'' (1979)<ref>Gilbert and Gubar, 136.</ref>\n| style = padding:2.0em\n| fontsize=95%\n}}\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]]'s seminal ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'' (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other [[feminist literary criticism|feminist criticism]] of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a ''woman'' writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in ''Mansfield Park'', Lady Catherine de Bourgh in ''Pride and Prejudice'' and Mrs. Churchill in ''Emma'' were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, who are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels, while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society.<ref>Irvine, 125.</ref> The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's writings, though most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did.<ref name=\"Irvine, 126\">Irvine, 126.</ref> Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed.<ref name=\"Irvine, 126\"/> The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time.<ref>Rajan, 102.</ref> Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's ''Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form'' (1979), Margaret Kirkham's ''Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction'' (1983), and [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia L. Johnson's]] ''Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel'' (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative{{'\"}}.<ref>Rajan, 103.</ref> Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing that women were just as capable of being rational as men, that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft.<ref>Irvine 128.</ref> Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.<ref>Todd, 33; Rajan, 102\u201303.</ref>\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as [[Jane West]], [[Hannah More]], and [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]] to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by [[conduct book]]s, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French.<ref>Irvine 34\u201335.</ref> Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony.<ref>Irvine 130.</ref> In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in ''Sense and Sensibility'' that the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in ''Mansfield Park'' the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and ''Northanger Abbey'' where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man.<ref>Irvine 130\u201331.</ref> Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in ''Mansfield Park'' is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers.<ref>Irvine 131.</ref> Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy.<ref>Irvine 132.</ref> Irvine, in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham, argued that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society, with her villains failing to live up to the standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system.<ref>Irvine 129.</ref> Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote that for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whether this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power.<ref name=\"Irvine, 133\">Irvine, 133.</ref> Irvine argued it was just as possible to see ''Emma'' as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 133\"/> Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivine used to argue that while ''Pride and Prejudice'' does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.<ref>Irvine, 134.</ref>\n\nMany scholars have noted \"modesty\" in the \"conduct books\" that were very popular for setting out the proper rules for young ladies. In Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\">Irvine 126.</ref> Modesty meant that a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet; modesty also meant that a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\"/> This double meaning meant that a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she was attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position.<ref name=\"Irvine 126\"/> Jan Fergus argued that for this reason,  Austen's books were subversive, engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\">Irvine 127.</ref> In the same way, Kirkham used ''Mansfield Park'' as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books, while, at the same time, rejecting the enfantisisation of women promoted by the conduct books, she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit.<ref>Irvine, 128\u201329.</ref> Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while, at the same time, undercutting such expectations.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\"/> Devoney Looser in the 1995 book ''Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism'' argued in her introduction that there were a number of ways in which Austen could be placed, not merely within a feminist tradition, but as herself a feminist.<ref name=\"Irvine 127\"/>\n\nUsing the theories of [[Michel Foucault]] as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay, {{\"'}}The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in ''Emma''\", argued that the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Foucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation.<ref>Irvine, 99\u2013100</ref> Finch and Bowen argued that the voice of the omnipresent narrator, together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in ''Emma,'' were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character. Seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind, persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment, all the while fooling her into thinking she was in love.<ref>Irvine, 100</ref> By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in ''Sense and Sensibility'' was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between \"psychology\" and \"character\" since Dashwood must be the observer of her character, and used what she has learned to grow.<ref>Irvine, 104</ref>\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic [[Tony Tanner (scholar)|Tony Tanner]]'s \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place.<ref>Irvine 111.</ref> Sedgwick argued that the way the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate, and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\">Irvine 111\u201312.</ref> Sedgwick says that the way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\"/> Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone.<ref name=\"Irvine 112\">Irvine 112.</ref> Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"[[culture war]]\" between liberals and conservatives.<ref name=\"Irvine 112\"/>\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England.<ref>Irvine pp. 145\u201346</ref> Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\".<ref>Irvine pp. 146\u201347</ref> According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance&nbsp;... the ''feel'' of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated from her language is still&nbsp;... peculiarly English\".<ref>Irvine p.146</ref> Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 ''Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity'' is full of historical errors such as his claim that Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\">Irvine p. 147</ref> Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed, or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time.<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\"/> Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.<ref name=\"Irvine p.147\"/>\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist criticism]] dominated Austen studies.<ref>Todd, 34\u201335.</ref> Generating heated debate, [[Edward Said]] devoted a chapter of his book ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993) to ''Mansfield Park'', arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether ''Mansfield Park'' justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial.<ref>Irvine pp. 135\u201337</ref> The debate about ''Mansfield Park'' and slavery is the one issue in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention.<ref>Irvine p.135</ref> Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and take up Said's thesis about ''Mansfield Park'' reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire.<ref>Irvine pp. 135\u201336</ref> Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay {{\"'}}What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' ''Mansfield Park'''s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the [[Haitian revolution]], which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, and was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\">Irvine p. 137</ref> Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based on a set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book ''Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions'' argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time, with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Stewart linked these concerns to ''Mansfield Park'', writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/>\n\nOther critics have seen the message of ''Mansfield Park'' as abolitionist.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford was \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in ''Mansfield Park'' and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous to his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park that he finds after he returns to England.<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in ''Mansfield Park'' \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather is used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.137\"/> Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which led to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies.<ref name=\"Irvine p.138\">Irvine p. 138</ref> Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that the much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chose to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"Irvine p.138\"/> Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel, that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park came from the plantation in Antigua.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\">Irvine p. 139</ref> John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that the parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric, not as literal, and that Sir Thomas' willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean, suggested that he be understood as a good master.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\"/> In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in ''Mansfield Park''.<ref name=\"Irvine p.139\"/>\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off on adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\">Irvine p. 142</ref> Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in ''Persuasion''; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in ''Mansfield Park''; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in ''Sense and Sensibility''.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domesticate otherwise scarred men, noting for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793\u201398, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood, by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne, is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue.<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/> Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British Empire; arguing instead in Austen's works that the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".<ref name=\"Irvine p.142\"/>\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France.<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\">Irvine, 143.</ref> Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of England defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\"/> Mee suggested that in ''Emma'', the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France.<ref name=\"Irvine, 143\"/> Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book ''British Fiction and the Production of Social Order'' argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England.<ref>Irvine, 144\u201345.</ref> In this regard, Janet Sorenson in ''The Grammar of Empire'' noted that in Austen's books, no characters speak in [[Nonstandard dialect|dialect]], and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.<ref>Irvine, 145.</ref>\n\nIn ''Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health{{'}}'', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body.<ref>Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 113\u201317; Stovel, 234\u201338; Rajan, 101\u201309.</ref> There has also been a return to considerations of [[aesthetics]] with [[D. A. Miller]]'s ''Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style'' (2003), which connects artistic concerns with [[queer theory]].<ref>Todd, 35.</ref> Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, when he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men.<ref name=\"Irvine 111-112\"/> Miller answered that it was because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.<ref>Irvine 110</ref>\n\n== Modern popular culture ==\n{{see also|Jane Austen in popular culture}}\n\n=== Modern Janeites ===\n[[File:Jane Austen Centre.jpg|thumb|The [[Jane Austen Centre]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], a place of [[pilgrimage]] for [[Janeite]]s<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 116.</ref>|alt=Photograph of a building decorated with Jane Austen posters and paraphernalia, including a mannequin dressed in early 19th-century clothing.]]\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\".<ref name=\"Johnson, 211\" /> Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs.<ref>Johnson, 223.</ref> Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious [[pilgrim]]s with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\".<ref>Lynch, \"Cult of Jane Austen\", 113\u201317.</ref> The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to [[Trekkie]]s, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while ''Star Trek'' can only claim to be a part of popular culture.<ref>Johnson, 224.</ref>\n\n=== Adaptations ===\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel ''Virtues and Vices'' (1981) and fantasy novel ''Resolve and Resistance'' (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels.

Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\".<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 163.</ref> The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\".<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 164\u201365.</ref> Those that emphasise [[nostalgia]] are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of [[postmodern]] playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.<ref>Lynch, \"Sequels\", 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:Greer Garson in Pride and Prejudice.JPG|left|thumb|[[Greer Garson]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]] in the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 ''Pride and Prejudice'']], the first feature film adaptation of the novel|alt=Black-and-white still of a woman gazing upwards, wearing an off-the shoulder dress, a prominent necklace, and a bow in her dark hair.]]\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared.<ref name=\"troogree2\">Troost and Greenfield, \"Introduction\", 2.</ref> The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] production of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]]. It has long been said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer [[Harpo Marx]], who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy.<ref>Looser, 127.</ref> Directed by [[Robert Z.

Often seen as the start of the \"[[Heritage film|heritage drama]]\" movement, this production was the first to be filmed largely on location.<ref>Troost, \"The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film\", 80.</ref> A push for \"fusion\" adaptations, or films that combined Hollywood style and British heritage style, began in the mid-1980s. The BBC's first fusion adaptation was the [[Northanger Abbey (1986 film)|1986 production of ''Northanger Abbey'']], which combined authentic style and 1980s punk, with characters often veering into the [[surrealism|surreal]].<ref name=\"troo82\">Troost, \"The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film\", 82.</ref>\n\nA wave of Austen adaptations began to appear around 1995, starting with [[Emma Thompson]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|adaptation of ''Sense and Sensibility'']] for [[Columbia Pictures]], a fusion production directed by [[Ang Lee]].<ref name=\"troo82\" /> This star-studded film departed from the novel in many ways, but it became a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for numerous awards, including seven [[Academy Award|Oscars]]. The BBC produced two adaptations in 1995: [[Persuasion (1995 film)|''Persuasion'']] and [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies's]] six-episode television drama, ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV serial)|Pride and Prejudice]]''. Starring [[Colin Firth]] and [[Jennifer Ehle]], Davies's production ignited \"Darcymania\" in Britain. Critics praised its smart departures from the novel as well as its sensual costuming, fast-paced editing, and original yet appropriate dialogue.<ref name=\"troo84\">Troost, \"The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film\", 84.</ref> The series sparked an explosion in the publication of printed Austen adaptations; in addition, 200,000 video copies of the serial were sold within a year of its airing, 50,000 within the first week alone.<ref name=\"troogree2\" /> Another [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|adaptation of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] was released in 2005. Starring [[Keira Knightley]], who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, [[Joe Wright]]'s film marked the first feature adaptation since 1940 that aspired to be faithful to the novel.<ref>Troost, \"The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film\", 86.</ref> Three more film adaptations appeared in 2007\u2014''[[Mansfield Park (2007 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (2007 film)|Persuasion]]''.<ref name=\"Glendinning\">Glendinning, Lee.

Gas Human Being No. 1}} is a Japanese [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]. The film is the story of a librarian ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]), his love for a dancer and his ability to change into a gaseous form.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{long plot|date=April 2016}}\nA high-speed pursuit between police and an escaping robber along Itsukaichi Highway is under way. The pursued car crashes and overturns down an embankment. Two policemen and Detective Okamoto ([[Tatsuya Mihashi]]) look to find the robber and are astonished to find nothing inside, not even blood.\n\nThe men hear the strains of music outside the property of a large nearby house. Okamoto directs one of the men to search the premises, while the other rings the buzzer at the front door. Investigating the music, Okamoto sees an outdoor stage upon which a dancer wearing a grotesque mask is rehearsing, accompanied by her servant Jiya. As the dancer ends her routine, the buzzer sounds. Jiya answers the door and informs the officer that he and his lady, Fujichiyo Kasuga ([[Kaoru Yachigusa]]), are alone and nobody has been by. The cop tries to take a peek inside, as Jiya informs him they do not have a car.\n\nThe next day, Okamoto shares lunch with his girlfriend, newspaper reporter Kyoko Kono ([[Keiko Sata]]). Kyoko questions him about the details of the robbery. Okamoto reveals there are no clues on how it was done or who did it. Kyoko feels she can find out as much information as Okamoto can, and perhaps even solve the case. Okamoto does not take her seriously.\n\nThe police officer who earlier had driven the squad car is thanked by the bank president for supplying extra guards. The bank president assures the cop that the bank's alarm is tested every day. The alarm suddenly goes off as a mysterious robber kills a bank employee and confronts the police officer. The cop opens fire on him, but the bullets have no effect on the robber. More cops from police headquarters arrive. They observe the dead employee behind the locked bars that protect the safe. The bank president, overwhelmed with grief, is led away.\n\nAt a meeting with the editor, lead employee Kawasaki ([[Kozo Nomura]]) suggests that Kyoko try to get information out of her boyfriend. Although she doubts Okamoto would keep any new developments from her, she gets a call from him, inviting her to lunch. They meet, and Okamoto asks Kyoko if she has ever heard of the dancer Fujichiyo. She cannot give much information, other than that the dancer comes from a distinguished family and was at one time wealthy, but has not danced in some time. Okamoto wonders why, and Kyoko tells him it is because of the dancer's parents and grandparents, but he does not believe her. Sensing trouble, Kyoko leaves the restaurant and calls her newspaper for more information on Fujichiyo.\n\nOkamoto's boss Tabata ([[Yoshifumi Tajima]]) informs him of the bank robbery and that an employee and a policeman have both died of suffocation by the mysterious robber. There are still no clues as to who did it. Okamoto tells his theory that the dancer Fujichiyo might be behind the robberies, but Tabata does not believe him.\n\nThe next day, Okamoto heads to Fujichiyo's house without official permission. Kyoko drives up and offers him a ride, but he lectures her and she drives off. Kyoko arrives at the dancer's house and sees a brand-new car being dusted by a chauffeur. She meets Fujichiyo and discovers that she will give a solo recital in a month, with a supporting company, and she requests that no word be given out yet, as things are not definite. Kyoko points out that the publicity would be helpful. The dancer insists that nothing official be released yet, and that there is no guarantee that any announcement will be made when and if the recital does take place.\n\nAs the car carrying Fujichiyo travels down the road, it passes Okamoto. Kyoko drives up and lets him get in, then they follow her. They find her at a public library and see her check out a book. The librarian Mizuno ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]) tells them the book she checked out contained ancient songs, and that she studies the library's ancient engravings.\n\nFujichiyo leaves and stops at the home of a respected chamber music tutor named Osaki ([[Kamayuki Tsubono]]). He informs her that he is too busy training to assist her at present. She then offers him 200,000&nbsp;yen if he will perform. Osaki is amazed at the amount and gladly takes it.\n\nUpon returning to his office, Okamoto discusses his research into Fujichiyo's affairs with his boss and her plans to stage a comeback. He believes she is getting the money from an unknown sponsor. Tabata suggests Okamoto continue his investigation.\n\nKyoko's newspaper office receives a call from a man claiming to be the bank robber, demanding to speak with the editor. The man states that at 3:00 the next day, he will rob the Kyodo bank in Shinjuku. He suggests the bank employees be given prior warning, so no one will get hurt. The man hangs up before insisting they make sure the story is printed correctly.\n\nThe next day, the Kyodo bank is infiltrated with police posing as bank employees, waiting for the robbery attempt. Some are positioned inside the vault. The hour of 3:00 is announced by the clock. A policeman named Hotta ([[Yukihiko Godo]]) tells Okamoto the time and that the robbery should have occurred by now. However, Inspector Inao ([[Yoshio Kosugi]]) comes inside the vault to tell them that they have caught the thief attempting to rob the bank. The captured man ([[Rem Yamamoto]]) is interrogated by the police and he tells him that he is the one who issued the warning on the phone. The police demand to know where the 56 million yen ended up, but he does not know where the money is.\n\nOkamoto and Kyoko meet at a restaurant where she congratulates him, but he does not believe the man's story, and still feels the answer lies with Fujichiyo. Kyoko admits the man's arrest does not answer the question of how the dancer got the money. She reasons that she might have gotten it from her family. Another detective enters the restaurant and tells Okamoto he is needed back at police headquarters. There, Tabata announces that a theater hired for the recital has received money with serial numbers matching those of the stolen money. The police arrive at Fujichiyo's house and search the premises. Okamoto finds the money, and the serial numbers match. She is taken to police headquarters and questioned by Okamoto and Inao. They ask who gave her the money, but she refuses to tell them.\n\nSome time later, the librarian Mizuno enters the police headquarters, where a group of journalists are in the press room. He then tells them that he was the one who robbed the banks to get Fujichiyo the money, but they are skeptical. He leaves and enters the conference room of the police station. Okamoto recognizes him and Mizuno offers to show the police the method used, on the condition they take him to the site of the second burglary. He is brought to the bank, where the circumstances will be recreated, with the bank president playing the part of the deceased employee. Mizuno walks up to the bars and to everybody's surprise he changes himself into a cloud of swirling vapor in front of everyone. The police fire at him, but the bullets have no effect. He then goes through the bars and suffocates the bank president, killing him. The Gas Man then opens the bars and takes a stack of money. Inao fires several bullets at the Gas Man, with no effect. The Gas Man throws the money at Inao's face and wraps around the man's neck, killing him. The gaseous form of Mizuno escapes through an overhead window before telling the police that Fujichiyo is not guilty and they must release her from custody.\n\nA meeting is held at police headquarters. Fujichiyo still refuses to cooperate with them capturing Mizuno. They keep her in custody so that they have a chance of catching Mizuno. However, Mizuno appears suddenly on the room and the police try to catch him. Okamoto shoots him at point-blank range, but he escapes in his gaseous form.\n\nMizuno then heads to the prison where Fujichiyo is being held. He kills two policemen and unlocks the dancer's cell. Fujichiyo tells him that if she escapes with him, she will be considered a criminal. Mizuno insists she come with him, but she still refuses. He listens to her, releases all of the prisoners and vanishes. A riot erupts between the police and the prisoners. While all of this is happening, Fujichiyo sits quietly in her cell alone.\n\nIn the newspaper office, Kyoko gets an idea of how to further his cause for Fujichiyo's freedom. She suggests contacting the Gas Man to her editor for an interview. The newspaper prints an invitation to him and an impromptu meeting is set up on the upper floors of an office building. The interview begins with Mizuno assuring the press that he is not from outer space, but is an Earthling as they are. He is asked how he became the Gas Man. Mizuno brings up the late professor of biology, Dr. Sano ([[Fuyuki Murakami]]).\n\nHis story begins as he was working at a college library. His successful career as a test pilot in the Japan Self Defense Force was cut short, due to the discovery of cancer in his lungs. He was visited by Dr. Sano, a professor at Johoku University and a medical doctor of Japan's space research program. It turns out that Mizuno was referred to the doctor by the Self Defense Force because the training he received made him a perfect candidate for their space pilot program.  Dr. Sano said that they were going to change the form of the human body, which would allow it to withstand the intense heat of the sun. Mizuno was offered 20,000 yen to undergo the experiment, but he admits the money was not important to him. He went to Dr. Sano's laboratory, where he was given an injection and lay down on a metal table, where he was secured by steel bars. Dr. Sano turned on the machine and Mizuno soon fell asleep. Later, Dr. Sano opened the chamber to find that Mizuno had become the Gas Man, with swirling mist where his body once was. Mizuno then regained his former shape with ease. He accused the doctor of deceiving him as to the true purpose of the experiment. Dr. Sano tried to leave, but Mizuno caught him. Dr. Sano accidentally reveals that Mizuno was not the first person he had experimented on. Realizing that the doctor might have killed them and feeling betrayed, Mizuno kills Dr. Sano.\n\nResuming his interviews, Mizuno admits that he feels indebted to the doctor. Because of his new-found powers, he can help Fujichiyo dance again. He also admits that he loved her before he became the Gas Man. The police suddenly barge in and fire rifle grenades loaded with poison gas, but to no avail, as Mizuno escapes again.\n\nThe police ask Fujichiyo to help them catch Mizuno, as Dr. Tamiya ([[Hisaya Ito]]) patronizes her, and says that he does not believe she knowingly received stolen money. Feeling the Gas Man is a threat to society, he and the other officials ask that she help them set a trap for him at her concert, but she does not go along with the plan. The police have no choice but to set Fujichiyo free.\n\nIn the newspaper office, it is revealed that an unspecified tragedy had affected Fujichiyo's life, forcing her to live her current existence.\n\nFujichiyo meets Osaki and is told that the musicians are too scared to perform the concert, fearing a confrontation between the Gas Man and the police. Fujichiyo tells him not to worry and that she can do the recital without them. Mizuno appears before her and he says that everything is ready for her recital, but he is upset that the money to make her recital was stolen, and upset at the taking of other people's lives. Mizuno is unperturbed by such trivialities. He tells her that what he did was all for her and that his love for her is now an obsession.\n\nDr. Tamiya meets with Okamoto and Tabata at Dr. Sano's laboratory. They devise a plan how to do in the Gas Man without harming Fujichiyo. They decide to use U.M. gas, which can be detonated in an enclosed area. The theater Mizuno chooses as the location for Fujichiyo is such a place.\n\nKyoko pleads with Fujichiyo to cancel the concert. The dancer resists the suggestion, seeing it as her destiny. Kyoko persists in her argument. Fujichiyo has been told by the police that they intend to trap Mizuno. In the process, many people may be injured or killed. Kyoko reckons the audience will be mostly thrill-seekers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Gas Man. She insists that Fujichiyo tell Mizuno not to attend, then help the police try to capture him later. Fujichiyo tells her that she must perform so that she can return the honor for his sake. Kyoko then asks her if she really loves him after all that has happened. Surprised at the question, Fujichiyo says that she does.\n\nOn the night of the recital, an unruly mob and a frenzied media gather outside the theater. The police try to keep both groups away from the theater. Fire engines are ready for when the gas detonates. Kyoko manages to break through the police barricade and runs for the theater. Okamoto follows her in. As Kyoko enters, she sees Fujichiyo and Jiya on stage as the dancer performs \"Daughter of Fuji\". Mizuno is seen sitting in the crowd, watching contentedly.\n\nIn Sano's laboratory, Tabata and Tamiya discuss the challenging task of trying to fill the theater with gas, getting everyone but Mizuno out, then setting the theater ablaze.\n\nAs the recital continues, the crowd begins to get restless, waiting for the Gas Man to appear. Mizuno stands up and informs them that he is the Gas Man, but the crowd is obdurate. Mizuno changes into his gaseous form, scaring all but one man out of the theater. During the disturbance, Kyoko runs to the stage pleading with Fujichiyo to leave, but she refuses to stop, saying that this is her final performance. Her servant also insists on staying with her. Mizuno alerts Okamoto to the fallen man.\n\nAt the laboratory, Tamiya suggests to Tabata that they wait until Mizuno is completely alone in the theater. Tabata is torn, for he does not quite have the opportunity he needs to set fire to the place. Having no choice, he orders the gas to be released.\n\nOkamoto and Kyoko take the fallen man out of the theater. They head for Sano's laboratory with news that Fujichiyo and Jiya have insisted on remaining with Mizuno. Tabata decides to throw the switch, but Kyoko pleads with him not to do it. Tabata says it is too late to stop now. The switch is thrown, but nothing happens. They find out that the detonating wires on the circuit board have been severed by Fujichiyo. As the recital ends, Fujichiyo bounds off the stage, embracing Mizuno. While savoring the moment with the man she loves, she reaches for a cigarette lighter to burn the theater down, along with Mizuno and Jiya.

Gas Human Being No. 1}} is a Japanese [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]. The film is the story of a librarian ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]), his love for a dancer and his ability to change into a gaseous form.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{long plot|date=April 2016}}\nA high-speed pursuit between police and an escaping robber along Itsukaichi Highway is under way. The pursued car crashes and overturns down an embankment. Two policemen and Detective Okamoto ([[Tatsuya Mihashi]]) look to find the robber and are astonished to find nothing inside, not even blood.\n\nThe men hear the strains of music outside the property of a large nearby house. Okamoto directs one of the men to search the premises, while the other rings the buzzer at the front door. Investigating the music, Okamoto sees an outdoor stage upon which a dancer wearing a grotesque mask is rehearsing, accompanied by her servant Jiya. As the dancer ends her routine, the buzzer sounds. Jiya answers the door and informs the officer that he and his lady, Fujichiyo Kasuga ([[Kaoru Yachigusa]]), are alone and nobody has been by. The cop tries to take a peek inside, as Jiya informs him they do not have a car.\n\nThe next day, Okamoto shares lunch with his girlfriend, newspaper reporter Kyoko Kono ([[Keiko Sata]]). Kyoko questions him about the details of the robbery. Okamoto reveals there are no clues on how it was done or who did it. Kyoko feels she can find out as much information as Okamoto can, and perhaps even solve the case. Okamoto does not take her seriously.\n\nThe police officer who earlier had driven the squad car is thanked by the bank president for supplying extra guards. The bank president assures the cop that the bank's alarm is tested every day. The alarm suddenly goes off as a mysterious robber kills a bank employee and confronts the police officer. The cop opens fire on him, but the bullets have no effect on the robber. More cops from police headquarters arrive. They observe the dead employee behind the locked bars that protect the safe. The bank president, overwhelmed with grief, is led away.\n\nAt a meeting with the editor, lead employee Kawasaki ([[Kozo Nomura]]) suggests that Kyoko try to get information out of her boyfriend. Although she doubts Okamoto would keep any new developments from her, she gets a call from him, inviting her to lunch. They meet, and Okamoto asks Kyoko if she has ever heard of the dancer Fujichiyo. She cannot give much information, other than that the dancer comes from a distinguished family and was at one time wealthy, but has not danced in some time. Okamoto wonders why, and Kyoko tells him it is because of the dancer's parents and grandparents, but he does not believe her. Sensing trouble, Kyoko leaves the restaurant and calls her newspaper for more information on Fujichiyo.\n\nOkamoto's boss Tabata ([[Yoshifumi Tajima]]) informs him of the bank robbery and that an employee and a policeman have both died of suffocation by the mysterious robber. There are still no clues as to who did it. Okamoto tells his theory that the dancer Fujichiyo might be behind the robberies, but Tabata does not believe him.\n\nThe next day, Okamoto heads to Fujichiyo's house without official permission. Kyoko drives up and offers him a ride, but he lectures her and she drives off. Kyoko arrives at the dancer's house and sees a brand-new car being dusted by a chauffeur. She meets Fujichiyo and discovers that she will give a solo recital in a month, with a supporting company, and she requests that no word be given out yet, as things are not definite. Kyoko points out that the publicity would be helpful. The dancer insists that nothing official be released yet, and that there is no guarantee that any announcement will be made when and if the recital does take place.\n\nAs the car carrying Fujichiyo travels down the road, it passes Okamoto. Kyoko drives up and lets him get in, then they follow her. They find her at a public library and see her check out a book. The librarian Mizuno ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]) tells them the book she checked out contained ancient songs, and that she studies the library's ancient engravings.\n\nFujichiyo leaves and stops at the home of a respected chamber music tutor named Osaki ([[Kamayuki Tsubono]]). He informs her that he is too busy training to assist her at present. She then offers him 200,000&nbsp;yen if he will perform. Osaki is amazed at the amount and gladly takes it.\n\nUpon returning to his office, Okamoto discusses his research into Fujichiyo's affairs with his boss and her plans to stage a comeback. He believes she is getting the money from an unknown sponsor. Tabata suggests Okamoto continue his investigation.\n\nKyoko's newspaper office receives a call from a man claiming to be the bank robber, demanding to speak with the editor. The man states that at 3:00 the next day, he will rob the Kyodo bank in Shinjuku. He suggests the bank employees be given prior warning, so no one will get hurt. The man hangs up before insisting they make sure the story is printed correctly.\n\nThe next day, the Kyodo bank is infiltrated with police posing as bank employees, waiting for the robbery attempt. Some are positioned inside the vault. The hour of 3:00 is announced by the clock. A policeman named Hotta ([[Yukihiko Godo]]) tells Okamoto the time and that the robbery should have occurred by now. However, Inspector Inao ([[Yoshio Kosugi]]) comes inside the vault to tell them that they have caught the thief attempting to rob the bank. The captured man ([[Rem Yamamoto]]) is interrogated by the police and he tells him that he is the one who issued the warning on the phone. The police demand to know where the 56 million yen ended up, but he does not know where the money is.\n\nOkamoto and Kyoko meet at a restaurant where she congratulates him, but he does not believe the man's story, and still feels the answer lies with Fujichiyo. Kyoko admits the man's arrest does not answer the question of how the dancer got the money. She reasons that she might have gotten it from her family. Another detective enters the restaurant and tells Okamoto he is needed back at police headquarters. There, Tabata announces that a theater hired for the recital has received money with serial numbers matching those of the stolen money. The police arrive at Fujichiyo's house and search the premises. Okamoto finds the money, and the serial numbers match. She is taken to police headquarters and questioned by Okamoto and Inao. They ask who gave her the money, but she refuses to tell them.\n\nSome time later, the librarian Mizuno enters the police headquarters, where a group of journalists are in the press room. He then tells them that he was the one who robbed the banks to get Fujichiyo the money, but they are skeptical. He leaves and enters the conference room of the police station. Okamoto recognizes him and Mizuno offers to show the police the method used, on the condition they take him to the site of the second burglary. He is brought to the bank, where the circumstances will be recreated, with the bank president playing the part of the deceased employee. Mizuno walks up to the bars and to everybody's surprise he changes himself into a cloud of swirling vapor in front of everyone. The police fire at him, but the bullets have no effect. He then goes though the bars and suffocates the bank president, killing him. The Gas Man then opens the bars and takes a stack of money. Inao fires several bullets at the Gas Man, with no effect. The Gas Man throws the money at Inao's face and wraps around the man's neck, killing him. The gaseous form of Mizuno escapes through an overhead window before telling the police that Fujichiyo is not guilty and they must release her from custody.\n\nA meeting is held at police headquarters. Fujichiyo still refuses to cooperate with them capturing Mizuno. They keep her in custody so that they have a chance of catching Mizuno. However, Mizuno appears suddenly on the room and the police try to catch him. Okamoto shoots him at point-blank range, but he escapes in his gaseous form.\n\nMizuno then heads to the prison where Fujichiyo is being held. He kills two policemen and unlocks the dancer's cell. Fujichiyo tells him that if she escapes with him, she will be considered a criminal. Mizuno insists she come with him, but she still refuses. He listens to her, releases all of the prisoners and vanishes. A riot erupts between the police and the prisoners. While all of this is happening, Fujichiyo sits quietly in her cell alone.\n\nIn the newspaper office, Kyoko gets an idea of how to further his cause for Fujichiyo's freedom. She suggests contacting the Gas Man to her editor for an interview. The newspaper prints an invitation to him and an impromptu meeting is set up on the upper floors of an office building. The interview begins with Mizuno assuring the press that he is not from outer space, but is an Earthling as they are. He is asked how he became the Gas Man. Mizuno brings up the late professor of biology, Dr. Sano ([[Fuyuki Murakami]]).\n\nHis story begins as he was working at a college library. His successful career as a test pilot in the Japan Self Defense Force was cut short, due to the discovery of cancer in his lungs. He was visited by Dr. Sano, a professor at Johoku University and a medical doctor of Japan's space research program. It turns out that Mizuno was referred to the doctor by the Self Defense Force because the training he received made him a perfect candidate for their space pilot program.  Dr. Sano said that they were going to change the form of the human body, which would allow it to withstand the intense heat of the sun. Mizuno was offered 20,000 yen to undergo the experiment, but he admits the money was not important to him. He went to Dr. Sano's laboratory, where he was given an injection and lay down on a metal table, where he was secured by steel bars. Dr. Sano turned on the machine and Mizuno soon fell asleep. Later, Dr. Sano opened the chamber to find that Mizuno had become the Gas Man, with swirling mist where his body once was. Mizuno then regained his former shape with ease. He accused the doctor of deceiving him as to the true purpose of the experiment. Dr. Sano tried to leave, but Mizuno caught him. Dr. Sano accidentally reveals that Mizuno was not the first person he had experimented on. Realizing that the doctor might have killed them and feeling betrayed, Mizuno kills Dr. Sano.\n\nResuming his interviews, Mizuno admits that he feels indebted to the doctor. Because of his new-found powers, he can help Fujichiyo dance again. He also admits that he loved her before he became the Gas Man. The police suddenly barge in and fire rifle grenades loaded with poison gas, but to no avail, as Mizuno escapes again.\n\nThe police ask Fujichiyo to help them catch Mizuno, as Dr. Tamiya ([[Hisaya Ito]]) patronizes her, and says that he does not believe she knowingly received stolen money. Feeling the Gas Man is a threat to society, he and the other officials ask that she help them set a trap for him at her concert, but she does not go along with the plan. The police have no choice but to set Fujichiyo free.\n\nIn the newspaper office, it is revealed that an unspecified tragedy had affected Fujichiyo's life, forcing her to live her current existence.\n\nFujichiyo meets Osaki and is told that the musicians are too scared to perform the concert, fearing a confrontation between the Gas Man and the police. Fujichiyo tells him not to worry and that she can do the recital without them. Mizuno appears before her and he says that everything is ready for her recital, but he is upset that the money to make her recital was stolen, and upset at the taking of other people's lives. Mizuno is unperturbed by such trivialities. He tells her that what he did was all for her and that his love for her is now an obsession.\n\nDr. Tamiya meets with Okamoto and Tabata at Dr. Sano's laboratory. They devise a plan how to do in the Gas Man without harming Fujichiyo. They decide to use U.M. gas, which can be detonated in an enclosed area. The theater Mizuno chooses as the location for Fujichiyo is such a place.\n\nKyoko pleads with Fujichiyo to cancel the concert. The dancer resists the suggestion, seeing it as her destiny. Kyoko persists in her argument. Fujichiyo has been told by the police that they intend to trap Mizuno. In the process, many people may be injured or killed. Kyoko reckons the audience will be mostly thrill-seekers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Gas Man. She insists that Fujichiyo tell Mizuno not to attend, then help the police try to capture him later. Fujichiyo tells her that she must perform so that she can return the honor for his sake. Kyoko then asks her if she really loves him after all that has happened. Surprised at the question, Fujichiyo says that she does.\n\nOn the night of the recital, an unruly mob and a frenzied media gather outside the theater. The police try to keep both groups away from the theater. Fire engines are ready for when the gas detonates. Kyoko manages to break through the police barricade and runs for the theater. Okamoto follows her in. As Kyoko enters, she sees Fujichiyo and Jiya on stage as the dancer performs \"Daughter of Fuji\". Mizuno is seen sitting in the crowd, watching contentedly.\n\nIn Sano's laboratory, Tabata and Tamiya discuss the challenging task of trying to fill the theater with gas, getting everyone but Mizuno out, then setting the theater ablaze.\n\nAs the recital continues, the crowd begins to get restless, waiting for the Gas Man to appear. Mizuno stands up and informs them that he is the Gas Man, but the crowd is obdurate. Mizuno changes into his gaseous form, scaring all but one man out of the theater. During the disturbance, Kyoko runs to the stage pleading with Fujichiyo to leave, but she refuses to stop, saying that this is her final performance. Her servant also insists on staying with her. Mizuno alerts Okamoto to the fallen man.\n\nAt the laboratory, Tamiya suggests to Tabata that they wait until Mizuno is completely alone in the theater. Tabata is torn, for he does not quite have the opportunity he needs to set fire to the place. Having no choice, he orders the gas to be released.\n\nOkamoto and Kyoko take the fallen man out of the theater. They head for Sano's laboratory with news that Fujichiyo and Jiya have insisted on remaining with Mizuno. Tabata decides to throw the switch, but Kyoko pleads with him not to do it. Tabata says it is too late to stop now. The switch is thrown, but nothing happens. They find out that the detonating wires on the circuit board have been severed by Fujichiyo. As the recital ends, Fujichiyo bounds off the stage, embracing Mizuno. While savoring the moment with the man she loves, she reaches for a cigarette lighter to burn the theater down, along with Mizuno and Jiya. Knowing that they can never live happily together as a normal couple, she ignites the lighter, causing the theater to go up in a maelstrom of flame, killing Fujichiyo and Jiya.\n\nWhile everyone outside gazes at the burning theater, they wonder if the Gas Man is dead. They then see the mangled, smoldering clothes of the Gas Man slowly crawling out of the theater, then returning to his original form, dead.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tatsuya Mihashi]] as Detective Okamoto\n* [[Keiko Sata]] as reporter Kyoko Kono \n* [[Kaoru Yachigusa]] as Fujichiyo, the dancer \n* [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as Mizuno the Vapor Man \n* [[Bokuzen Hidari]] as Fujichiyo's guardian\n* [[Hisaya Ito]] as Dr. Tamiya\n* [[Takamaru Sasaki]]\n* [[Tetsu Nakamura (actor)|Tetsu Nakamura]]\n* [[Murakami Fuyuki]]\n* [[Ren Yamamoto]]\n{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=176}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was distributed in Japan by [[Toho]] on December 11, 1960.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=176}} It was later released in the United States as ''The Human Vapor'' by Brenco Pictures with an English-language dub May 20, 1964.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=176}} The film was released as a  [[double feature]] with ''[[Gorath]]'', and was edited down to 79 minutes.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=176}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn a contemporary review, \"Whit.\" of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared the film plot superior to its companion double feature ''Gorath'' and that its special effects by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] were \"expert\", while the acting was \"competent\".{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=185}} The review concluded that the English-language dub they watched was \"far from gratifying\" and that when the lips did not match the English dialogue it \"decreased realism\".{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=185}}\n\n== References ==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |title=Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films |publisher=McFarland |date=1994 |isbn=0-89950-853-7 |ref=harv|authorlink=Stuart Galbraith IV}}\n* {{cite book |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |title=The Toho Studios Story: A History and Complete Filmography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7o8pq6G_dYC |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |location= |isbn=1461673747}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Willis|editor1-first=Donald|title=Variety's Complete Science Fiction Reviews|year=1985|ISBN=0-8240-6263-9|publisher=Garland|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0053853}}\n*{{tcmdb title|557548}}\n* Scheib, Richard.

Offspring stay in the family group until they are no longer dependent, usually at two or three years old. Bachelor stallions, and sometimes old stallions, join bachelor groups. Family groups can join together to form a herd that moves together.\n\nThe patterns of their daily lives exhibit [[horse behavior]] similar to that of [[feral horse]] herds. Stallions herd, drive, and defend all members of their family, while the mares often display leadership in the family. Stallions and mares stay with their preferred partners for years. While behavioral synchronization is high among mares, stallions other than the main harem stallion are generally less stable in this respect.\n\nHome range in the wild is little studied, but estimated as 1.2-24&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the Hustai National Park and 150-825&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the [[Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Przewalski's Horse (Equus ferus) Fact Sheet: Behavior & Ecology |url=http://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/przewalskishorse/behavior |publisher=San Diego Zoo Global Library |via=IELC}}</ref>\n\nHorses maintain visual contact with their family and herd at all times, and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, [[scent marking]], and a wide range of visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.<ref>{{cite book |author=Feh, C. |year=2005 |article=Relationships and communication in socially natural horse herds |title=The Domestic Horse: the evolution, development and management of its behaviour |editor1=Mills, Daniel |editor2=McDonnell, Sue |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\nPrzewalski horse's diet consists mostly of vegetation. Many plant species are in a typical Przewalski's horse environment, including: ''[[Elymus repens]]'', ''[[Carex]] ''spp., [[Fabaceae]], and [[Asteraceae]].<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf |title=Diet of the Przewalski's horse ''Equus przewalskii'' in the Chernobyl exclusion zone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185432/http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |author1=Kateryna Slivinska |author2=Grzegorz Kopij |journal=Polish Journal of Ecology |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=841\u2013847 |date=July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> While the horses eat a variety of different plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, Przewalski's horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, they favor ''Elymus repens'', ''[[Corynephorus canescens]]'', ''[[Festuca valesiaca]],'' and ''[[Chenopodium album]]''. In early summer, they favor ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'' and ''[[Trifolium]]'', and in late summer, they gravitate towards ''E.&nbsp;repens'' and ''[[Vicia cracca]]''.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/> In winter, for example, the horses eat ''[[Salix]] ''spp., ''[[Pyrus communis]]'', ''[[Malus]] sylvatica'', ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'', ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' spp., and ''[[Alnus]]'' spp. Additionally, Przewalski's horses may dig for ''[[Festuca]]'' spp., ''[[Bromus inermis]]'', and ''E.&nbsp;repens'' that grow beneath the ice and snow. Their winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/> In the wintertime, Przewalski's horses experience hypodermis, a condition in which one's metabolic rate slows down. They eat their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski's horses most often eat ''E.&nbsp;repens'', ''[[Trifolium pratense]]'', ''Vicia cracca'', ''[[Poa trivialis]]'', ''Dactylis glomerata'', and ''Bromus inermis''.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nMating occurs in late spring or early summer. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of \ufb01ve. Stallions assemble groups of mares or challenge the leader of another group for dominance. Females are able to give birth at the age of three and have a gestation period of 11-12&nbsp;months.

He was the explorer and naturalist who first described the horse in 1881, after having gone on an expedition to find it, based on rumors of its existence. Many of these horses were captured around 1900 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] and placed in zoos. As noted above, about 12-15 reproduced and formed today's population.\n[[File:Portrait of Przewalski's Horse.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Head shot, showing convex profile]]\nThe native population declined in the 20th century due to a combination of factors, with the wild population in Mongolia dying out in the 1960s. The last herd was sighted in 1967, and the last individual horse in 1969. Expeditions after this failed to locate any horses, and the species had been designated \"extinct in the wild\" for over 30&nbsp;years.\n\nAfter 1945, only two captive populations in zoos remained, in [[Tierpark Hellabrunn|Munich]] and in [[Prague Zoo|Prague]]. The most valuable group, in [[Askania Nova]], [[Ukraine]], was shot by German soldiers during [[World War&nbsp;II]] occupation, and the group in the United States had died out.  Competition with livestock, hunting, capture of foals for zoological collections, military activities, and harsh winters recorded in 1945, 1948, and 1956 are considered to be the main causes of the decline in Przewalski's horse population. By the end of the 1950s, only 12&nbsp;individual horses were left in the world.<ref name=Ryder1>O. A. Ryder et al, ibid</ref>\n\n[[File:Przewalski 26-9-2004-3.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Przewalski's horses.]]\n[[File:Equus ferus przewalskii 2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Vaska, a Przewalski's horse trained to be ridden.]]\nIn 1977, the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse was founded in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, by Jan and Inge Bouman. The foundation started a program of exchange between captive populations in zoos throughout the world to reduce [[inbreeding]], and later began a breeding program of its own. As a result of such efforts, the extant herd has retained a far greater genetic diversity than its [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] made likely.<ref name=Ryder1/>\n\nSince 1986, Chinese researchers have bred Przewalski's horses in captivity, with the program seeing over 20&nbsp;years of success.\n\nIn 1992, 16&nbsp;horses were released into the wild in Mongolia, followed by additional animals later on. One of the areas to which they were reintroduced became [[Khustain Nuruu National Park]] in 1998. Another reintroduction site is [[Great Gobi&nbsp;B Strictly Protected Area]], located at the fringes of the [[Gobi desert]]. Lastly, in 2004 and 2005, 22&nbsp;horses were released by the Association Takh to a third reintroduction site in the buffer zone of the [[Khar Us Nuur National Park]], in the northern edge of the Gobi ecoregion. In the winter of 2009\u20132010, one of the worst ''[[dzud]]'' or snowy winter conditions ever hit Mongolia. The population of  Prezewalski's horse in the Great Gobi B SPA was drastically affected, providing clear evidence of the risks associated with reintroducing small and sequestered species in unpredictable and unfamiliar environments.\n\nSince 2011, [[Prague Zoo]] has transported 35&nbsp;horses to Mongolia in eight rounds, in cooperation with partners (Czech Air Force, European Breeding Programme for Przewalski's Horses, Association pour de cheval du Przewalski: Takh, Czech Development Agency, Czech Embassy in Mongolia and others) and it plans to continue to return horses to the wild in the future. In the framework of the project [[Return of the Wild Horses]], it sustains its activities by supporting local inhabitants. The zoo has the longest uninterrupted history of breeding Przewalski's horses in the world and keeps the studbook of this species.\n\nThe reintroduced horses successfully reproduced, and the status of the animal was changed from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"endangered\" in 2005.<ref name=ZSL051219/> On the [[IUCN Red List]], they were reclassified from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"critically endangered\" after a reassessment in 2008<ref>{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41763/summ |title=Equus ferus (Asian Wild Horse, Mongolian Wild Horse, Przewalski's Horse) }}</ref> and from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" after a 2011 reassessment.<ref name=IUCN2011/>\n\n==Conservation efforts==\n[[File:Wintercoat.jpg|thumb|Winter coat]]\nWhile dozens of zoos worldwide have Przewalski's horses in small numbers,  specialized reserves are also dedicated primarily to the species. The world's largest captive-breeding program for Przewalski's horses is at the [[Askania Nova]] preserve in Ukraine. Thirty one horses were also released in the area evacuated after the [[Chernobyl accident]], which now serves as a deserted ''[[de facto]]'' nature reserve.<ref name=bbc060420/> In Chernobyl, the population reached 65&nbsp;individuals in 2003, but poachers decreased their number to an estimated 30\u201340&nbsp;individuals by 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Victoria |date=27 July 2011 |title=Chernobyl's Przewalski's horses are poached for meat |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058 |website=[[BBC|BBC Nature]] |access-date=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427213925/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058 |archive-date=27 April 2018 }}</ref> An intensely researched population of free-ranging animals was also introduced to the [[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]]'' [[puszta]]'' in Hungary; data on social structure, behavior, and diseases gathered from these animals are used to improve the Mongolian conservation effort.\n\nSeveral American zoos also collaborated in breeding ''E.&nbsp;f.&nbsp;przewalskii'' from 1979 to 1982.<ref name=BC8204/> Recent advances in equine reproductive science in the United States also have potential to further preserve and expand the gene pool. In October 2007, scientists at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] successfully reversed a [[vasectomy]] on a Przewalski's horse \u2014 the first operation of its kind on this species and possibly the first ever on any endangered species. While normally a vasectomy may be performed on an endangered animal under limited circumstances, particularly if an individual has already produced many offspring and its genes are overrepresented in the population, scientists realized the animal in question was one of the most genetically valuable Przewalski's horses in the North American breeding program.<ref name=AP080617/> The first birth by [[artificial insemination]] occurred on 27 July 2013, at the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]].<ref name=PHAI/><ref>{{cite magazine |title=First Przewalski's Horse Born Via Artificial Insemination |date=5 August 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130805-przewalski-horse-born-artificial-insemination-animal-science/ |magazine=National Geographic |accessdate=14 August 2013 |last=Shenk |first=Emily |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLe Villaret, located in the Cevennes National Park in southern France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski's horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski's horse behaviors. Eleven zoo-born horses were brought to Le&nbsp;Villaret in 1993. Horses born there are adapted to life in the wild; they are free to choose their own mates and must forage on their own. Such a unique breeding site was necessary to produce the individuals that were reintroduced to Mongolia in 2004 and 2005. In 2012, 39&nbsp;individuals were at Le Villaret.<ref name=takhleaflet/>\n\nThe Przewalski's Horse Reintroduction Project of China was initiated in 1985 when 11&nbsp;wild horses were imported from overseas. After more than two decades of effort, the [[Xinjiang]] Wild Horse Breeding Centre has bred a large number of the horses,  55 of which were released into the [[Kalamely Mountain]] area. The animals quickly adapted to their new environment. In 1988, six foals were born and survived, and by 2001, over 100&nbsp;horses were at the centre.  {{As of|2013}}, the center hosted 127 horses divided into 13&nbsp;breeding herds and three bachelor herds.\n\nReintroductions organized by Western European countries started in the 1990s. These were later stopped, mostly for financial reasons. In 2011, [[Prague Zoo]] started a new project, [[Return of the Wild Horses]]. With the support of public and many strategic partners, these yearly transports of captive-bred horses into the [[Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area]] continue today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Return of the Przewalski's Horse to Mongolia |url=https://www.zoopraha.cz/en/animals/we-help-them-to-survive/projects/7678-return-of-the-przewalski-s-horse-to-mongolia |website=Zoo Praha |access-date=2019-06-27 |df=dmy-all |lang=en}}</ref> Since 2004, there is also a program to reintroduce Przewalski's horses that were bred in France into Mongolia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/Claudia-Feh-explorer-moments-reintroducing-endangered-Przewalski-horses-into-the-wild/ |title=A Wild Horse on the Comeback Trail |first=Gary |last=Strauss |work=National Geographic |date=2016-11-17 |accessdate=2019-04-14 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{Portal|Mammals|Horses}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe historical fiction novel ''The Winter Horses'' by [[Philip Kerr]] tells the story of two people at [[Askaniya-Nova]] biosphere reserve in Ukraine who attempt to save Przewalski's horses from the dinner tables of Nazi soldiers during World War II.<ref>{{cite book|title=The winter horses|last=Kerr|first=Philip|publisher=Walker Books|location=London|year=2014|oclc = 904260670}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', Eliza Thornberry unsuccessfully tries to tame and ride a Przewalski's horse in the Season 3 episode \"Horse Sense\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mongolian horse]] (domestic)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=IUCN2011>{{cite news | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/red_list/?8548/Another-leap-towards-the-Barometer-of-Life | title = Another leap towards the Barometer of Life | work = International Union for the Conservation of Nature | date = 10 November 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111115014738/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/red_list/?8548%2FAnother-leap-towards-the-Barometer-of-Life | archivedate = 15 November 2011 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ZSL051219>{{cite news | url = http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html | title = An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse | work = ZSL Living Conservation | date = 19 December 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120212234213/http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html | archivedate = 12 February 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=boyd94>{{cite chapter | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Bvg99Qq54nUC | title = The History of Przewalski's Horse| work=Przewalski's Horse | last1=Bouman | first1=Inge | last2=Bouman | first2=Jan | editor-first = Lee | editor-last = Boyd | editor-first2=Katherine A. | editor-last2=Houpt | year = 1994 | pages = 5\u201338 | isbn = 9780791418895 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gaddy6>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1Rqfio1iov8C&pg=PA6&dq=giant+squid+chromosomes#v=snippet&q=66%20chromosones&f=false | title = Biodiversity: Przewalski's Horse, Edna's Trillium, the Giant Squid, and Over 1.5 Million Other Species | first = L.

Offspring stay in the family group until they are no longer dependent, usually at two or three years old. Bachelor stallions, and sometimes old stallions, join bachelor groups. Family groups can join together to form a herd that moves together.\n\nThe patterns of their daily lives exhibit [[horse behavior]] similar to that of [[feral horse]] herds. Stallions herd, drive, and defend all members of their family, while the mares often display leadership in the family. Stallions and mares stay with their preferred partners for years. While behavioral synchronization is high among mares, stallions other than the main harem stallion are generally less stable in this respect.\n\nHome range in the wild is little studied, but estimated as 1.2-24&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the Hustai National Park and 150-825&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the [[Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Przewalski's Horse (Equus ferus) Fact Sheet: Behavior & Ecology |url=http://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/przewalskishorse/behavior |publisher=San Diego Zoo Global Library |via=IELC}}</ref>\n\nHorses maintain visual contact with their family and herd at all times, and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, [[scent marking]], and a wide range of visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.<ref>{{cite book |author=Feh, C. |year=2005 |article=Relationships and communication in socially natural horse herds |title=The Domestic Horse: the evolution, development and management of its behaviour |editor1=Mills, Daniel |editor2=McDonnell, Sue |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\nPrzewalski horse's diet consists mostly of vegetation. Many plant species are in a typical Przewalski's horse environment, including: ''[[Elymus repens]]'', ''[[Carex]] ''spp., [[Fabaceae]], and [[Asteraceae]].<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf |title=Diet of the Przewalski's horse ''Equus przewalskii'' in the Chernobyl exclusion zone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185432/http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |author1=Kateryna Slivinska |author2=Grzegorz Kopij |journal=Polish Journal of Ecology |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=841\u2013847 |date=July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> While the horses eat a variety of different plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, Przewalski's horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, they favor ''Elymus repens'', ''[[Corynephorus canescens]]'', ''[[Festuca valesiaca]],'' and ''[[Chenopodium album]]''. In early summer, they favor ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'' and ''[[Trifolium]]'', and in late summer, they gravitate towards ''E.&nbsp;repens'' and ''[[Vicia cracca]]''.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/> In winter, for example, the horses eat ''[[Salix]] ''spp., ''[[Pyrus communis]]'', ''[[Malus]] sylvatica'', ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'', ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' spp., and ''[[Alnus]]'' spp. Additionally, Przewalski's horses may dig for ''[[Festuca]]'' spp., ''[[Bromus inermis]]'', and ''E.&nbsp;repens'' that grow beneath the ice and snow. Their winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/> In the wintertime, Przewalski's horses experience hypodermis, a condition in which one's metabolic rate slows down. They eat their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski's horses most often eat ''E.&nbsp;repens'', ''[[Trifolium pratense]]'', ''Vicia cracca'', ''[[Poa trivialis]]'', ''Dactylis glomerata'', and ''Bromus inermis''.<ref name=\"pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nMating occurs in late spring or early summer. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of \ufb01ve. Stallions assemble groups of mares or challenge the leader of another group for dominance. Females are able to give birth at the age of three and have a gestation period of 11-12&nbsp;months.

He was the explorer and naturalist who first described the horse in 1881, after having gone on an expedition to find it, based on rumors of its existence. Many of these horses were captured around 1900 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] and placed in zoos. As noted above, about 12-15 reproduced and formed today's population.\n[[File:Portrait of Przewalski's Horse.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Head shot, showing convex profile]]\nThe native population declined in the 20th century due to a combination of factors, with the wild population in Mongolia dying out in the 1960s. The last herd was sighted in 1967, and the last individual horse in 1969. Expeditions after this failed to locate any horses, and the species had been designated \"extinct in the wild\" for over 30&nbsp;years.\n\nAfter 1945, only two captive populations in zoos remained, in [[Tierpark Hellabrunn|Munich]] and in [[Prague Zoo|Prague]]. The most valuable group, in [[Askania Nova]], [[Ukraine]], was shot by German soldiers during [[World War&nbsp;II]] occupation, and the group in the United States had died out.  Competition with livestock, hunting, capture of foals for zoological collections, military activities, and harsh winters recorded in 1945, 1948, and 1956 are considered to be the main causes of the decline in Przewalski's horse population. By the end of the 1950s, only 12&nbsp;individual horses were left in the world.<ref name=Ryder1>O. A. Ryder et al, ibid</ref>\n\n[[File:Przewalski 26-9-2004-3.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Przewalski's horses.]]\n[[File:Equus ferus przewalskii 2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Vaska, a Przewalski's horse trained to be ridden.]]\nIn 1977, the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse was founded in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, by Jan and Inge Bouman. The foundation started a program of exchange between captive populations in zoos throughout the world to reduce [[inbreeding]], and later began a breeding program of its own. As a result of such efforts, the extant herd has retained a far greater genetic diversity than its [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] made likely.<ref name=Ryder1/>\n\nSince 1986, Chinese researchers have bred Przewalski's horses in captivity, with the program seeing over 20&nbsp;years of success.\n\nIn 1992, 16&nbsp;horses were released into the wild in Mongolia, followed by additional animals later on. One of the areas to which they were reintroduced became [[Khustain Nuruu National Park]] in 1998. Another reintroduction site is [[Great Gobi&nbsp;B Strictly Protected Area]], located at the fringes of the [[Gobi desert]]. Lastly, in 2004 and 2005, 22&nbsp;horses were released by the Association Takh to a third reintroduction site in the buffer zone of the [[Khar Us Nuur National Park]], in the northern edge of the Gobi ecoregion. In the winter of 2009\u20132010, one of the worst ''[[dzud]]'' or snowy winter conditions ever hit Mongolia. The population of  Prezewalski's horse in the Great Gobi B SPA was drastically affected, providing clear evidence of the risks associated with reintroducing small and sequestered species in unpredictable and unfamiliar environments.\n\nSince 2011, [[Prague Zoo]] has transported 35&nbsp;horses to Mongolia in eight rounds, in cooperation with partners (Czech Air Force, European Breeding Programme for Przewalski's Horses, Association pour de cheval du Przewalski: Takh, Czech Development Agency, Czech Embassy in Mongolia and others) and it plans to continue to return horses to the wild in the future. In the framework of the project [[Return of the Wild Horses]], it sustains its activities by supporting local inhabitants. The zoo has the longest uninterrupted history of breeding Przewalski's horses in the world and keeps the studbook of this species.\n\nThe reintroduced horses successfully reproduced, and the status of the animal was changed from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"endangered\" in 2005.<ref name=ZSL051219/> On the [[IUCN Red List]], they were reclassified from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"critically endangered\" after a reassessment in 2008<ref>{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41763/summ |title=Equus ferus (Asian Wild Horse, Mongolian Wild Horse, Przewalski's Horse) }}</ref> and from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" after a 2011 reassessment.<ref name=IUCN2011/>\n\n==Conservation efforts==\n[[File:Wintercoat.jpg|thumb|Winter coat]]\nWhile dozens of zoos worldwide have Przewalski's horses in small numbers,  specialized reserves are also dedicated primarily to the species. The world's largest captive-breeding program for Przewalski's horses is at the [[Askania Nova]] preserve in Ukraine. Thirty one horses were also released in the area evacuated after the [[Chernobyl accident]], which now serves as a deserted ''[[de facto]]'' nature reserve.<ref name=bbc060420/> In Chernobyl, the population reached 65&nbsp;individuals in 2003, but poachers decreased their number to an estimated 30\u201340&nbsp;individuals by 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Victoria |date=27 July 2011 |title=Chernobyl's Przewalski's horses are poached for meat |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058 |website=[[BBC|BBC Nature]] |access-date=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427213925/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058 |archive-date=27 April 2018 }}</ref> An intensely researched population of free-ranging animals was also introduced to the [[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]]'' [[puszta]]'' in Hungary; data on social structure, behavior, and diseases gathered from these animals are used to improve the Mongolian conservation effort.\n\nSeveral American zoos also collaborated in breeding ''E.&nbsp;f.&nbsp;przewalskii'' from 1979 to 1982.<ref name=BC8204/> Recent advances in equine reproductive science in the United States also have potential to further preserve and expand the gene pool. In October 2007, scientists at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] successfully reversed a [[vasectomy]] on a Przewalski's horse \u2014 the first operation of its kind on this species and possibly the first ever on any endangered species. While normally a vasectomy may be performed on an endangered animal under limited circumstances, particularly if an individual has already produced many offspring and its genes are overrepresented in the population, scientists realized the animal in question was one of the most genetically valuable Przewalski's horses in the North American breeding program.<ref name=AP080617/> The first birth by [[artificial insemination]] occurred on 27 July 2013, at the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]].<ref name=PHAI/><ref>{{cite magazine |title=First Przewalski's Horse Born Via Artificial Insemination |date=5 August 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130805-przewalski-horse-born-artificial-insemination-animal-science/ |magazine=National Geographic |accessdate=14 August 2013 |last=Shenk |first=Emily |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLe Villaret, located in the Cevennes National Park in southern France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski's horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski's horse behaviors. Eleven zoo-born horses were brought to Le&nbsp;Villaret in 1993. Horses born there are adapted to life in the wild; they are free to choose their own mates and must forage on their own. Such a unique breeding site was necessary to produce the individuals that were reintroduced to Mongolia in 2004 and 2005. In 2012, 39&nbsp;individuals were at Le Villaret.<ref name=takhleaflet/>\n\nThe Przewalski's Horse Reintroduction Project of China was initiated in 1985 when 11&nbsp;wild horses were imported from overseas. After more than two decades of effort, the [[Xinjiang]] Wild Horse Breeding Centre has bred a large number of the horses,  55 of which were released into the [[Kalamely Mountain]] area. The animals quickly adapted to their new environment. In 1988, six foals were born and survived, and by 2001, over 100&nbsp;horses were at the centre.  {{As of|2013}}, the center hosted 127 horses divided into 13&nbsp;breeding herds and three bachelor herds.\n\nReintroductions organized by Western European countries started in the 1990s. These were later stopped, mostly for financial reasons. In 2011, [[Prague Zoo]] started a new project, [[Return of the Wild Horses]]. With the support of public and many strategic partners, these yearly transports of captive-bred horses into the [[Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area]] continue today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Return of the Przewalski's Horse to Mongolia |url=https://www.zoopraha.cz/en/animals/we-help-them-to-survive/projects/7678-return-of-the-przewalski-s-horse-to-mongolia |website=Zoo Praha |access-date=2019-06-27 |df=dmy-all |lang=en}}</ref> Since 2004, there is also a program to reintroduce Przewalski's horses that were bred in France into Mongolia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/Claudia-Feh-explorer-moments-reintroducing-endangered-Przewalski-horses-into-the-wild/ |title=A Wild Horse on the Comeback Trail |first=Gary |last=Strauss |work=National Geographic |date=2016-11-17 |accessdate=2019-04-14 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{Portal|Mammals|Horses}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe historical fiction novel ''The Winter Horses'' by [[Philip Kerr]] tells the story of two people at [[Askaniya-Nova]] biosphere reserve in Ukraine who attempt to save Przewalski's horses from the dinner tables of Nazi soldiers during World War II.<ref>{{cite book|title=The winter horses|last=Kerr|first=Philip|publisher=Walker Books|location=London|year=2014|oclc = 904260670}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', Eliza Thornberry unsuccessfully tries to tame and ride a Przewalski's horse in the Season 3 episode \"Horse Sense\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mongolian horse]] (domestic)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=IUCN2011>{{cite news | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/red_list/?8548/Another-leap-towards-the-Barometer-of-Life | title = Another leap towards the Barometer of Life | work = International Union for the Conservation of Nature | date = 10 November 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111115014738/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/red_list/?8548%2FAnother-leap-towards-the-Barometer-of-Life | archivedate = 15 November 2011 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ZSL051219>{{cite news | url = http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html | title = An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse | work = ZSL Living Conservation | date = 19 December 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120212234213/http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html | archivedate = 12 February 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=boyd94>{{cite chapter | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Bvg99Qq54nUC | title = The History of Przewalski's Horse| work=Przewalski's Horse | last1=Bouman | first1=Inge | last2=Bouman | first2=Jan | editor-first = Lee | editor-last = Boyd | editor-first2=Katherine A. | editor-last2=Houpt | year = 1994 | pages = 5\u201338 | isbn = 9780791418895 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gaddy6>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1Rqfio1iov8C&pg=PA6&dq=giant+squid+chromosomes#v=snippet&q=66%20chromosones&f=false | title = Biodiversity: Przewalski's Horse, Edna's Trillium, the Giant Squid, and Over 1.5 Million Other Species | first = L.
