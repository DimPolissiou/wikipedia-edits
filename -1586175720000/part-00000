The Scottish chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in 1847 noticed a natural [[petroleum]] seepage in the [[Riddings]] [[colliery]] at [[Alfreton]], [[Derbyshire]] from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. \nThe new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the [[sandstone]] roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.\n\nFollowing up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded, by distilling [[cannel coal]] at a low heat, a fluid resembling [[petroleum]], which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named \"paraffine oil\" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.<ref name=russell>{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}</ref>\n\nThe production of these oils and solid [[paraffin wax]] from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.\n[[File:West Lothian shale bing, Scotland.JPG|thumb|Shale bings near [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], 3 of a total of 19 in [[West Lothian]]]]\n\n[[Abraham Pineo Gesner]], a Canadian geologist developed a process to refine a liquid fuel from coal, bitumen and oil shale. His new discovery, which he named kerosene, burned more cleanly and was less expensive than competing products, such as whale oil. In 1850, Gesner created the Kerosene Gaslight Company and began installing lighting in the streets in Halifax and other cities. By 1854, he had expanded to the United States where he created the North American Kerosene Gas Light Company at Long Island, New York. Demand grew to where his company's capacity to produce became a problem, but the discovery of petroleum, from which kerosene could be more easily produced, solved the supply problem.\n\nIn 1846, what some consider the first modern oil well in the world was drilled in the South Caucasus region of Russian Empire, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku (in settlement Bibi-Heybat), by Russian Major Alekseev based on data of Russian scientist N. Voskoboynikov.<ref name=\"The History of the Oil Industry\">[http://www.sjvgeology.org/history/]</ref>\n\n[[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \"rock oil\" (\"petr-oleum\") [[Petroleum seep|seep]]s, in 1852, and the first rock oil mine was built in [[B\u00f3brka, Krosno County|B\u00f3brka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|central European Galicia]] ([[Poland]]) in 1854. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world, and [[Meerzoeff]] built the first modern Russian [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in the mature oil fields at [[Baku]] in 1861. At that time Baku produced about 90% of the world's oil.\n\nThe question of what constituted the first commercial oil well is a difficult one to answer.

However, the first well ever drilled anywhere in the world, which produced oil, was drilled in 1857 to a depth of 280 feet by the American Merrimac Company in La Brea (Spanish for \u201cPitch\u201d) in southeast Trinidad in the Caribbean.<ref>Down A L \u201cHistory of Trinidad\u2019s Oil\u201d (Address to the 22nd Annual Dinner Geological Society of Trinidad and Tobago 1960)</ref> \n\nAdditionally, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century.

Built in 1856 and inaugurated in 1857 by the brothers Teodor and Marin Mehedin\u0163eanu, the Rafov Refinery, a refinery built at  Ploiesti, had a surface area of four hectares, and the daily production reached over seven tons, obtained in cylindrical iron and iron casts that were heated by fire from wood; it was then called \"the world's first systematic oil distillery,\" setting the record for being the world's first oil refinery, according to the Academy Of World Records.<ref>[http://www.worldrecordacademy.org/technology/worlds-first-oil-refinery-ploiesti-218277]</ref> \n\nThis refinery obtained, on the basis of a contract concluded in October 1856 between Teodor Mehedin\u0163eanu and the City Hall of Bucharest, the exclusive right to supply the illumination of the Wallachian capital with oil lamp. The contract began to be executed on April 1, 1857, when, by replacing the kidnapped oil with the products supplied by the Rafov refinery, \"Bucharest became the first city in the world illuminated entirely with distilled crude oil.\"\n\nIn 1857, the total production of Romania was amounted to 275 tons of crude oil. With this figure, Romania was registered as the first country in world oil production statistics, before other large oil producing states such as the United States of America (1860), Russia (1863), Mexico (1901) or Persia (1913 ).<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=3596 The History Of Romanian Oil Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603102058/http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=3596 |date=2009-06-03 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm PBS: World Events]</ref> \n\nIn 1875, crude oil was discovered by [[David Beaty (businessman)|David Beaty]] at his home in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]].

Later, following the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] energy crises, there was significant [[News media|media]] coverage on the subject of oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will [[peak oil|eventually run out]], at least as an economically viable energy source. Although at the time the most common and popular predictions were quite dire, a period of increased production and reduced demand in the following years caused an [[1980s oil glut|oil glut in the 1980s]].

The Scottish chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in 1847 noticed a natural [[petroleum]] seepage in the [[Riddings]] [[colliery]] at [[Alfreton]], [[Derbyshire]] from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. \nThe new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the [[sandstone]] roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.\n\nFollowing up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded, by distilling [[cannel coal]] at a low heat, a fluid resembling [[petroleum]], which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named \"paraffine oil\" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.<ref name=russell>{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}</ref>\n\nThe production of these oils and solid [[paraffin wax]] from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.\n[[File:West Lothian shale bing, Scotland.JPG|thumb|Shale bings near [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], 3 of a total of 19 in [[West Lothian]]]]\n\n[[Abraham Pineo Gesner]], a Canadian geologist developed a process to refine a liquid fuel from coal, bitumen and oil shale. His new discovery, which he named kerosene, burned more cleanly and was less expensive than competing products, such as whale oil. In 1850, Gesner created the Kerosene Gaslight Company and began installing lighting in the streets in Halifax and other cities. By 1854, he had expanded to the United States where he created the North American Kerosene Gas Light Company at Long Island, New York. Demand grew to where his company\u2019s capacity to produce became a problem, but the discovery of petroleum, from which kerosene could be more easily produced, solved the supply problem.\n\nIn 1846, what some consider the first modern oil well in the world was drilled in the South Caucasus region of Russian Empire, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku (in settlement Bibi-Heybat), by Russian Major Alekseev based on data of Russian scientist N. Voskoboynikov.<ref name=\"The History of the Oil Industry\">[http://www.sjvgeology.org/history/]</ref>\n\n[[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \"rock oil\" (\"petr-oleum\") [[Petroleum seep|seep]]s, in 1852, and the first rock oil mine was built in [[B\u00f3brka, Krosno County|B\u00f3brka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|central European Galicia]] ([[Poland]]) in 1854. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world, and [[Meerzoeff]] built the first modern Russian [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in the mature oil fields at [[Baku]] in 1861. At that time Baku produced about 90% of the world's oil.\n\nThe question of what constituted the first commercial oil well is a difficult one to answer.

However, the first well ever drilled anywhere in the world, which produced oil, was drilled in 1857 to a depth of 280 feet by the American Merrimac Company in La Brea (Spanish for \u201cPitch\u201d) in southeast Trinidad in the Caribbean.<ref>Down A L \u201cHistory of Trinidad\u2019s Oil\u201d (Address to the 22nd Annual Dinner Geological Society of Trinidad and Tobago 1960)</ref> \n\nAdditionally, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century.

Built in 1856 and inaugurated in 1857 by the brothers Teodor and Marin Mehedin\u0163eanu, the Rafov Refinery, a refinery built at  Ploiesti, had a surface area of four hectares, and the daily production reached over seven tons, obtained in cylindrical iron and iron casts that were heated by fire from wood; it was then called \"the world's first systematic oil distillery,\" setting the record for being the world's first oil refinery, according to the Academy Of World Records.<ref>[http://www.worldrecordacademy.org/technology/worlds-first-oil-refinery-ploiesti-218277]</ref> \n\nThis refinery obtained, on the basis of a contract concluded in October 1856 between Teodor Mehedin\u0163eanu and the City Hall of Bucharest, the exclusive right to supply the illumination of the Wallachian capital with oil lamp. The contract began to be executed on April 1, 1857, when, by replacing the kidnapped oil with the products supplied by the Rafov refinery, \"Bucharest became the first city in the world illuminated entirely with distilled crude oil.\"\n\nIn 1857, the total production of Romania was amounted to 275 tons of crude oil. With this figure, Romania was registered as the first country in world oil production statistics, before other large oil producing states such as the United States of America (1860), Russia (1863), Mexico (1901) or Persia (1913 ).<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=3596 The History Of Romanian Oil Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603102058/http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=3596 |date=2009-06-03 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm PBS: World Events]</ref> \n\nIn 1875, crude oil was discovered by [[David Beaty (businessman)|David Beaty]] at his home in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]].

Later, following the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] energy crises, there was significant [[News media|media]] coverage on the subject of oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will [[peak oil|eventually run out]], at least as an economically viable energy source.
