[[Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey|Minnesota-Duluth]] won their third WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament and the [[Broadmoor Trophy]] and received the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]'s automatic bid to the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].\n\n==Format==\nThe first round of the postseason tournament featured a best-of-three games format. All ten conference teams participated in the tournament. Teams were seeded No. 1 through No. 10 according to their final conference standing, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with an identical number of points accumulated. The top five seeded teams each earned home ice and host one of the lower seeded teams.\n\nThe winners of the first round series advanced to the [[Xcel Energy Center]] for the '''WCHA Final Five''', the collective name for the quarterfinal, semifinal, and championship rounds. The Final Five used a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] format. Teams were re-seeded No. 1 through No. 5 according to the final regular season conference standings, with the top three teams automatically advancing to the semifinals.\n\n===Conference Standings===\n''Note: GP = Games Played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; PTS = Points; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against''\n{{2008\u201309 WCHA standings (men)}}\n\n====Tiebreakers====\n*Wisconsin and Colorado College each finished the regular season with 31 points.
