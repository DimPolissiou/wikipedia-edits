These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P.

Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}.

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). Author Unknown: On the Trial of Anonymous. Henry Holt and Company</ref>\n\nIn most cases, author profiling in the context of forensic linguistics involves a single text problem, in which there is either no or few comparison texts available and no external evidence that points to the author.<ref name= \"Grant 2008\">Grant, T.

Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019.

With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]].

Different combinations of textual attributes belonging to the authors were identified and analyzed using author profiling, including [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] and [[syntactical]] features.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> Pioneering research in author profiling focused mostly on a single genre until the shift towards author profiling on [[social media]] and the [[Internet]].<ref name=\"CAPS\">Bilan, I. & Zhekova, D.

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

This is because of how a [[social network]] may be built, expanded, and used for social action in the site.<ref>Dam, J. W. V., & Velden, M. V. D. (2015).

In:Decision Support Systems, 70, 60\u201372. doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2014.12.001</ref> In such processes, users share personal content that may be used for author profiling studies.

Retrieved fromhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.03.005</ref> which may then be used for author profiling.\n\nIn the context of [[Facebook]], author profiling involves mainly [[English language|English]] textual data, but also involves Non-english languages that include: [[Roman Urdu]], [[Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=\"Fatima et al\"/><ref name=\" Rangel\"/> While author profiling studies on [[Facebook]] have been predominantly for [[gender]] and [[ageing|age]] -group identification, there have been attempts to derive attributes to predict [[religiosity]], the IT background of users, and even basic [[emotion]] defined by [[Paul Ekman]] among others.<ref name=\"Hsieh_et_al\"/><ref name=\"Rangel & Rosso\">Rangel, F., & Rosso, P. (2013). Use of Language and Author Profiling: Identification of Gender and Age. Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few [[social media]] platforms originating from [[asia]]n countries with predominantly [[asia]]n languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/>\n\n====Chat Logs====\n\nChat logs have been studied for author profiling as they include much textual [[discourse]], the analysis of which have contributed to applicational studies including social trends and [[forensic science]]. Sources of data for author profiling from [[chat log]]s include platforms such as [[Yahoo!]], [[AIM (software)]] and [[WhatsApp]].<ref>Lin, J. (2007). Automatic Author Profiling of Online Chat Logs.

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). Author Unknown: On the Trial of Anonymous. Henry Holt and Company</ref>\n\nIn most cases, author profiling in the context of forensic linguistics involves a single text problem, in which there is either no or few comparison texts available and no external evidence that points to the author.<ref name= \"Grant 2008\">Grant, T.

F. (2010). Author identification from opposing perspectives in forensic linguistics.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest and best-known examples of the use of author profiling is by [[Roger Shuy]], who was asked to examine a ransom note linked to a notorious kidnapping case in 1979. Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019.

With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]].

They were announced on September 16, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September\n21, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout  September 16, 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

They were announced on September 16, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September\n21, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout  September 16, 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

He was elevated to bishop in the [[Church of Uganda]] in 1974 and retired in 1998. In 2001, he was barred from performing services. Whilst it is widely claimed that this is because of his stance on gay rights, the church claims that it was because of his participation in the consecration of a man to be a bishop of a church with which the Church of Uganda is not in communion.<ref>Church of England Newspaper April 14th 2011</ref> He has since worked with the [[Charismatic Church of Uganda]] and the progressive [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States, and founded Integrity Uganda and the Saint Paul's Reconciliation and Equality Centre in Kampala.  In 2006 the Church of Uganda declared him \"no longer a bishop\" and revoked all remaining privileges for his involvement with the Charismatic denomination. For his stance Senyonjo has received several honours including the [[Clinton Global Citizen Award]], and has been invited to participate in documentaries and international speaking tours.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n=== Upbringing ===\nAccording to a biography in ''[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]'' of Uganda, Senyonjo was born to Maria Mukulu Abul'awawe and Erika Kapere on December 8, 1931, and was raised in the [[Mubende]] district (now [[Kiboga]]) of [[Singo]] sub-county.<ref name=Agiro>{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.ug/new/archives/2006arch/features/poso/may/poso200604271.php|title=Pro-gay Bishop has no apologies|author=Elizabeth Agiro|date=2006-03-09|publisher=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104907/http://www.observer.ug/new/archives/2006arch/features/poso/may/poso200604271.php|archivedate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nA good student, he attended [[Sinde Primary School]] until the age of 10, transferring to [[Bukomero Primary School]], residing with paternal uncle Douglas Kyeyune and wife Miriam.  An anecdote describes him walking 16&nbsp;km to [[Nalukolongo]] for a kilogram of meat, which Miriam craved during her pregnancy, when the local trading centre did not have any.<ref name=Agiro />\n\nHis father died in 1944, and Senyonjo went to live with his aunt in [[Kitii]], near [[Kasangati]].  He continued to do well at [[Wampewo Primary School]] and after P.6<!--- No, I have no idea, sorry ---> he attended [[King's College Budo]] in 1947.  On holidays he sold pancakes for his aunt, leading to him being jailed for a night at the age of 13 by an officer who thought he must have stolen money from a locked donation box.  He described being without blanket or shoes in a cell with people who were dirty and infected with lice.<ref name=Agiro />\n\nIn 1952 he entered [[Makerere University]] but failed to complete a course in medicine, which he attributes to spending too much time with friends because his upbringing had not prepared him for the freedom of the university.  In 1954 he taught English, mathematics and health science at [[Luwule Secondary School]].<ref name=Agiro />\n\n=== Marriage and children ===\nIn 1959 he married his first wife Ruth Nakanwagi, returning to work 17 days later; that same day she was killed by a poisonous snake in her garden.<ref name=Agiro />\n\nIn 1963 he met his second wife Mary while she was working as a schoolteacher at [[Ndejje Demonstration School]].  They were married in December of that year.<ref name=Agiro />  Mary later received cataract surgery in the United States while Senyonjo was speaking in Washington in 2011.<ref name=Chumbley />\n\nSenyonjo is the father of seven children, and has adopted three.

In 1960 he enrolled as a private candidate for the [[Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education]], majoring in divinity.  After consulting with his mother and his best friend, Hannington Kintu, he stated he had a dream of a candle that could not be extinguished, which he took as an affirmation of his [[religious calling|calling]] to religious service.  He began a three-year diploma course at [[Buwalasi Theological College]] in 1961, being ordained deacon two years later, after which he attended [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in the United States.  He was attached to an [[Episcopal Church of Epiphany]] and mentored by Hugh McCandlas for priest ordination, later performed by Bishop Donegan in 1964.<ref name=Agiro />  He was ordained in the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=boxturtle />\n\nAfter returning to Uganda in 1968, Senyonjo was assigned to [[Theological College Mukuno]].

Believing that \"one doesn't need to be converted first to another sexuality to be loved by God\", Senyonjo founded [[Integrity Uganda]] as a branch of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] LGBT outreach organization [[Integrity USA]].  He founded a community centre as a safe place for Ugandan gays, and worked to provide housing and employment for those denied them after being [[outed]].<ref name=boxturtle />\n\nIn June 2008, Senyonjo explained his beliefs for the film ''[[Voice of Witness|Voices of Witness Africa]]''. He said \"Jesus left us the most important cardinal rule: 'Love one another as I have loved you.'  And I cannot see how a person loves another by discriminating against that other person without going deep into what are the causes of this person to be what that person is.  Humbly, without intimidation.\"  He said that the Bible could be interpreted many ways, but that the real word of God was Jesus, the \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|Word made flesh]]\", and that in the [[Gospel of Saint John]], there were things that Jesus said he would not be able to reveal then, but that the [[Holy Spirit]] would reveal over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/10582664|title=Bishop Christopher Ssenyonjo|publisher=Voices of Witness (excerpts)}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 Senyonjo attended an anti-gay conference from March 5\u20137, 2009, titled \"Exposing the truth behind homosexuality and the homosexual agenda\", which featured the American activists [[Scott Lively]], [[Exodus International]] executive [[Don Schmierer]], and [[International Healing Foundation]] representative [[Caleb Lee Brundidge]]. Described by Lively as a \"nuclear bomb against the gay agenda in Uganda\", the conference associated gays with [[Nazism]], child molestation, AIDS and the [[Rwandan genocide]], and has been credited with bringing about unprecedented persecution culminating in the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014]].  Senyonjo described the interaction of conference participants with government officials as leading to the introduction of the bill, and the need for education regarding claims of [[homosexual recruitment]] in schools. Senyonjo said \"I was at one time accused that I was going to schools and trying to recruit, as it were, people into homosexuality, which is actually blackmail. And you can see, what are the intentions of these people to do this?&nbsp;...

campaigner for [[LGBT rights in Uganda]].  He was elevated to bishop in the [[Church of Uganda]] in 1974 and retired in 1998. In 2001, he was barred from performing services. Whilst it is widely claimed that this is because of his stance on gay rights, the church claims that it was because of his participation in the consecration of a man to be a bishop of a church with which the Church of Uganda is not in communion.<ref>Church of England Newspaper April 14th 2011</ref> He has since worked with the [[Charismatic Church of Uganda]] and the progressive [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States, and founded Integrity Uganda and the Saint Paul's Reconciliation and Equality Centre in Kampala.  In 2006 the Church of Uganda declared him \"no longer a bishop\" and revoked all remaining privileges for his involvement with the Charismatic denomination. For his stance Senyonjo has received several honours including the [[Clinton Global Citizen Award]], and has been invited to participate in documentaries and international speaking tours.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n=== Upbringing ===\nAccording to a biography in ''[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]'' of Uganda, Senyonjo was born to Maria Mukulu Abul'awawe and Erika Kapere on December 8, 1931, and was raised in the [[Mubende]] district (now [[Kiboga]]) of [[Singo]] sub-county.<ref name=Agiro>{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.ug/new/archives/2006arch/features/poso/may/poso200604271.php|title=Pro-gay Bishop has no apologies|author=Elizabeth Agiro|date=2006-03-09|publisher=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104907/http://www.observer.ug/new/archives/2006arch/features/poso/may/poso200604271.php|archivedate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nA good student, he attended [[Sinde Primary School]] until the age of 10, transferring to [[Bukomero Primary School]], residing with paternal uncle Douglas Kyeyune and wife Miriam.

In 1960 he enrolled as a private candidate for the [[Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education]], majoring in divinity.  After consulting with his mother and his best friend, Hannington Kintu, he stated he had a dream of a candle that could not be extinguished, which he took as an affirmation of his [[religious calling|calling]] to religious service.  He began a three-year diploma course at [[Buwalasi Theological College]] in 1961, being ordained deacon two years later, after which he attended [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in the United States.

Believing that \"one doesn't need to be converted first to another sexuality to be loved by God\", Senyonjo founded [[Integrity Uganda]] as a branch of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] LGBT outreach organization [[Integrity USA]].  He founded a community centre as a safe place for Ugandan gays, and worked to provide housing and employment for those denied them after being [[outed]].<ref name=boxturtle />\n\nIn June 2008, Senyonjo explained his beliefs for the film ''[[Voice of Witness|Voices of Witness Africa]]''. He said \"Jesus left us the most important cardinal rule: 'Love one another as I have loved you.'  And I cannot see how a person loves another by discriminating against that other person without going deep into what are the causes of this person to be what that person is.  Humbly, without intimidation.\"  He said that the Bible could be interpreted many ways, but that the real word of God was Jesus, the \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|Word made flesh]]\", and that in the [[Gospel of Saint John]], there were things that Jesus said he would not be able to reveal then, but that the [[Holy Spirit]] would reveal over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/10582664|title=Bishop Christopher Ssenyonjo|publisher=Voices of Witness (excerpts)}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 Senyonjo attended an anti-gay conference from March 5\u20137, 2009, titled \"Exposing the truth behind homosexuality and the homosexual agenda\", which featured the American activists [[Scott Lively]], [[Exodus International]] executive [[Don Schmierer]], and [[International Healing Foundation]] representative [[Caleb Lee Brundidge]]. Described by Lively as a \"nuclear bomb against the gay agenda in Uganda\", the conference associated gays with [[Nazism]], child molestation, AIDS and the [[Rwandan genocide]], and has been credited with bringing about unprecedented persecution culminating in the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014]].  Senyonjo described the interaction of conference participants with government officials as leading to the introduction of the bill, and the need for education regarding claims of [[homosexual recruitment]] in schools. Senyonjo said \"I was at one time accused that I was going to schools and trying to recruit, as it were, people into homosexuality, which is actually blackmail.
