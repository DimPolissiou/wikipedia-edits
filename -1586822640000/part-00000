There, struggling songwriter and composer [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|David Seville]] has his latest demo rejected by JETT Records' calm and nice chief executive, [[Ian Hawke]], his college roommate, who suggests that Dave give up writing songs. The Chipmunks hop into a [[basket]] of [[muffins]] that Dave stole from one of Ian's coworkers, and follow Dave home. Once there, Dave discovers the Chipmunks and kicks them out, only to hear them sing \"[[Only You (And You Alone)]].\" Dave then makes a deal with the Chipmunks to sing songs he writes in exchange for shelter. Unfortunately, when Dave tries to present the Chipmunks to Ian, they fail to sing due to [[stage fright]]. The day worsens as Dave is [[Involuntary termination of employment|dismissed]] from his advertising job due to the Chipmunks having ruined his presentation. While hosting dinner with former girlfriend Claire, Dave struggles to hide the Chipmunks after Alvin attempts to create a romantic atmosphere, making Claire uncomfortable and causing her to leave. To make it up to him, the Chipmunks sing Dave's song to Ian, prompting Ian to sign a record deal.\n\nThe Chipmunks quickly become an international success. When Dave expresses concern for their well-being and insists that the Chipmunks are simply kids, Ian convinces them that Dave is holding them back. After a misunderstanding, the Chipmunks choose to live with Ian, who was revealed to be an evil thief who wants to keep the Chipmunks forever. Once there, he spoils them with candy and toys. Once they set off on a nationwide coast-to-coast tour, Ian takes advantage of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 by overworking them constantly. Frustrated by what Ian has done to the Chipmunks, Dave decides to infiltrate their concert to reunite with them. Before their tour can begin, a veterinarian explains to Ian that the Chipmunks' voices have worn due to exhaustion and suggests that they take a long rest, but as Ian doesn't want to cancel the concert and give refunds, he advises the Chipmunks to lip-sync. With Claire's help, Dave is allowed into the concert; the Chipmunks see Dave and decide to ruin the show. Ian locks the Chipmunks in a cage and prepares to take them on their world tour, escaping in his limousine with Dave in pursuit, but the Chipmunks have already escaped to Dave's car; Dave happily admits that he loves them like his own family. Meanwhile, Ian is shocked to see that the Chipmunks have replaced themselves with their merchandising dolls and is now unemployed as punishment for his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[David Seville|David \"Dave\" Seville]], a struggling songwriter and father figure to Alvin, Simon and Theodore \n*[[David Cross]] as Ian Hawke, the chief executive at JETT Records\n*[[Cameron Richardson]] as Claire Wilson, Dave's ex-girlfriend\n*[[Jane Lynch]] as Gail, an advertising executive and Dave's former boss\n*[[Justin Long]] as Alvin Seville (voice)\n**[[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.]] as Alvin Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Simon Seville (voice)\n**[[Steve Vining]] as Simon Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Jesse McCartney]] as Theodore Seville (voice)\n**[[Janice Karman]] as Theodore Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Kevin Symons]] as Ted\n*[[Frank Maharajh]] as Barry\n*Veronica Alicino as Amy\n*[[Oliver Muirhead]] as Butler\n\n== Production ==\n[[Ross Bagdasarian Jr.]], the son of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] creator [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]] who revived the franchise after his father's death, dreamed of making a live-action ''Alvin'' film since 1997, \"and the dream has had many nightmare moments.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|title=A Chipmunk Interview \u2013 part 1|last=|first=|date=December 27, 2007|work=Channel 24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103210050/https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|archive-date=3 January 2020|accessdate=December 22, 2019}}</ref> On September 17, 2004, [[Fox 2000 Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox Animation]] and Bagdasarian Productions announced they would collaborate to create a live-action computer-generated film starring [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=September 14, 2004|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/alvin-to-squeak-again-1117910455/|title=\u2018Alvin\u2019 to squeak again|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On April 17, 2005, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' writer [[Jon Vitti]] was revealed to be writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=April 17, 2005|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/fox-animation-ups-cohen-1117921226/|title=Fox Animation ups Cohen|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On January 24, 2007, it was announced [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was in talks with Fox to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=LaPorte|first=Nicole|date=January 24, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/hill-to-direct-chipmunks-1117958050/|title=Hill to direct \u2018Chipmunks\u2019|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On March 7, 2007, [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] joined the project to play David Seville,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mcnary|first=Dave|date=March 7, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/news/chipmunks-befriend-earl-star-1117960746/?jwsource=cl|title=\u2018Chipmunks\u2019 befriend \u2018Earl\u2019 star|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> and [[Cameron Richardson]] signed on March 21.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodd|first=Stacy|date=March 21, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/cameron-richardson-2-1117961581/|title=Cameron Richardson|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> David was a more clean-cut character for Lee than his past roles, which he appreciated.<ref name = \"LAtimespro\"/>\n\nBagdasarian and his wife, [[Janice Karman]], had always voiced the chipmunks since they revived the franchise;

The second track on the album is \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", a remake version, without [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as the voice of Dave. However, the seventh track, the rock version of the song, features Lee as the voice of Dave. The soundtrack is the first album to be released in three years by Bagdasarian Productions, and is the group's 43rd album overall. Four songs from the album have charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe album has been certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments of over one million copies.\n\n===Reception===\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1217153}}</ref>\n}}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\nIn December 2007, the album debuted at #133 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In its second week of sales, however, the album jumped to #67 on the chart.\n\nThe album's highest peak was #5 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it the group's highest on the chart album since ''[[Chipmunks in Low Places]]'' (which peaked at #21). Following ''Alvin and the Chipmunk''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s DVD release, the soundtrack went back into the top ten from number 16 to number five with a 111% sales increase; it sold 51,000 copies of what was its 18th week on the chart,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hasty|first=Katie|date=April 9, 2008|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045912/strait-speeds-past-rem-to-debut-at-no-1|title=Strait Speeds Past R.E.M.

By doing this, the album has become the group's first RIAA-certified album since ''[[Chipmunks in Low Places]]'' (which also went Platinum). ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' has become the Chipmunks' third Platinum album and sixth RIAA-certified album total.\n\n===Songs===\nFour songs from the album managed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 during the month of December 2007. By doing this, it became the group's first charting songs in 47 years (\"[[Alvin for President]]\" became the last charting single for the group; it peaked at #95 in 1960). Despite this feat, none of the songs were released as singles or ever solicited to mainstream radio (although it is possible that kid-oriented radio stations, such as [[Radio Disney]], might have played them anyway) and charted solely because of high digital downloads caused by the anticipation of the group's film, ''Alvin and the Chipmunks''.\n\nThe four songs that charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 (and with the chart peaks included and the songs' Hot Digital Songs peaks) were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Song\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Witch Doctor (2007 Version)\" (featuring Chris Classic)\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|[[United States|US]] ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n!align=\"left\"|62\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) (2007 Version)\"\n!align=\"left\"|66\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Bad Day\"\n!align=\"left\"|67\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Funkytown\" \n!align=\"left\"|86\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Witch Doctor (2007 Version)\" (featuring Chris Classic)\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|US [[Hot Digital Songs]]\n!align=\"left\"|16\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) (2007 Version)\"\n!align=\"left\"|28\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Bad Day\"\n!align=\"left\"|51\n|}\n\n===Track listing===\nA soundtrack sampler was released along with the DVD of the film in a two pack sold exclusively at Walmart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.walmart.com/1336/9185976/alvin-and-the-chipmunks-2007-with-soundtrack-sampler-cd-full-frame-widescreen-reviews/reviews.htm|title=Customer Reviews|publisher=Walmart}}</ref> This features five songs produced exclusively for the soundtrack.\n{{tracklist\n| headline         = Track listing<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Alvin-Chipmunks-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000YK5BZU Alvin And The Chipmunks -

Plot summaries are usually between 400 and 700 words. -->\nA tree that three young chipmunk brothers [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|Alvin, Simon, and Theodore]] live in is cut down and driven to [[Los Angeles]] after JETT Records purchases it as a Christmas tree. There, struggling songwriter and composer [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|David Seville]] has his latest demo rejected by JETT Records' calm and nice chief executive, [[Ian Hawke]], his college roommate, who suggests that Dave give up writing songs. The Chipmunks hop into a [[basket]] of [[muffins]] that Dave stole from one of Ian's coworkers, and follow Dave home. Once there, Dave discovers the Chipmunks and kicks them out, only to hear them sing \"[[Only You (And You Alone)]].\" Dave then makes a deal with the Chipmunks to sing songs he writes in exchange for shelter. Unfortunately, when Dave tries to present the Chipmunks to Ian, they fail to sing due to [[stage fright]]. The day worsens as Dave is [[Involuntary termination of employment|dismissed]] from his advertising job due to the Chipmunks having ruined his presentation. While hosting dinner with former girlfriend Claire, Dave struggles to hide the Chipmunks after Alvin attempts to create a romantic atmosphere, making Claire uncomfortable and causing her to leave. To make it up to him, the Chipmunks sing Dave's song to Ian, prompting Ian to sign a record deal.\n\nThe Chipmunks quickly become an international success. When Dave expresses concern for their well-being and insists that the Chipmunks are simply kids, Ian convinces them that Dave is holding them back. After a misunderstanding, the Chipmunks choose to live with Ian, who was revealed to be an evil thief who wants to keep the Chipmunks forever. Once there, he spoils them with candy and toys. Once they set off on a nationwide coast-to-coast tour, Ian takes advantage of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 by overworking them constantly. Frustrated by what Ian has done to the Chipmunks, Dave decides to infiltrate their concert to reunite with them. Before their tour can begin, a veterinarian explains to Ian that the Chipmunks' voices have worn due to exhaustion and suggests that they take a long rest, but as Ian doesn't want to cancel the concert and give refunds, he advises the Chipmunks to lip-sync. With Claire's help, Dave is allowed into the concert; the Chipmunks see Dave and decide to ruin the show. Ian locks the Chipmunks in a cage and prepares to take them on their world tour, escaping in his limousine with Dave in pursuit, but the Chipmunks have already escaped to Dave's car; Dave happily admits that he loves them like his own family. Meanwhile, Ian is shocked to see that the Chipmunks have replaced themselves with their merchandising dolls and is now unemployed as punishment for his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Justin Long]] as Alvin Seville (voice)\n**[[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.]] as Alvin Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Simon Seville (voice)\n**[[Steve Vining]] as Simon Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Jesse McCartney]] as Theodore Seville (voice)\n**[[Janice Karman]] as Theodore Seville (singing voice)\n*[[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[David Seville|David \"Dave\" Seville]], a struggling songwriter and father figure to Alvin, Simon and Theodore \n*[[David Cross]] as Ian Hawke, the chief executive at JETT Records\n*[[Cameron Richardson]] as Claire Wilson, Dave's ex-girlfriend\n*[[Jane Lynch]] as Gail, an advertising executive and Dave's former boss\n*[[Kevin Symons]] as Ted\n*[[Frank Maharajh]] as Barry\n*Veronica Alicino as Amy\n\n== Production ==\n[[Ross Bagdasarian Jr.]], the son of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] creator [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]] who revived the franchise after his father's death, dreamed of making a live-action ''Alvin'' film since 1997, \"and the dream has had many nightmare moments.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|title=A Chipmunk Interview \u2013 part 1|last=|first=|date=December 27, 2007|work=Channel 24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103210050/https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|archive-date=3 January 2020|accessdate=December 22, 2019}}</ref> On September 17, 2004, [[Fox 2000 Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox Animation]] and Bagdasarian Productions announced they would collaborate to create a live-action computer-generated film starring [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=September 14, 2004|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/alvin-to-squeak-again-1117910455/|title=\u2018Alvin\u2019 to squeak again|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On April 17, 2005, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' writer [[Jon Vitti]] was revealed to be writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=April 17, 2005|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/fox-animation-ups-cohen-1117921226/|title=Fox Animation ups Cohen|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On January 24, 2007, it was announced [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was in talks with Fox to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=LaPorte|first=Nicole|date=January 24, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/hill-to-direct-chipmunks-1117958050/|title=Hill to direct \u2018Chipmunks\u2019|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On March 7, 2007, [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] joined the project to play David Seville,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mcnary|first=Dave|date=March 7, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/news/chipmunks-befriend-earl-star-1117960746/?jwsource=cl|title=\u2018Chipmunks\u2019 befriend \u2018Earl\u2019 star|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> and [[Cameron Richardson]] signed on March 21.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodd|first=Stacy|date=March 21, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/cameron-richardson-2-1117961581/|title=Cameron Richardson|work=Variety|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref> David was a more clean-cut character for Lee than his past roles, which he appreciated.<ref name = \"LAtimespro\"/>\n\nBagdasarian and his wife, [[Janice Karman]], had always voiced the chipmunks since they revived the franchise;

By doing this, the album has become the group's first RIAA-certified album since ''[[Chipmunks in Low Places]]'' (which also went Platinum). ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' has become the Chipmunks' third Platinum album and sixth RIAA-certified album total.\n\n===Songs===\nFour songs from the album managed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 during the month of December 2007. By doing this, it became the group's first charting songs in 47 years (\"[[Alvin for President]]\" became the last charting single for the group; it peaked at #95 in 1960). Despite this feat, none of the songs were released as singles or ever solicited to mainstream radio (although it is possible that kid-oriented radio stations, such as [[Radio Disney]], might have played them anyway) and charted solely because of high digital downloads caused by the anticipation of the group's film, ''Alvin and the Chipmunks''.\n\nThe four songs that charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 (and with the chart peaks included and the songs' Hot Digital Songs peaks) were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Song\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Witch Doctor (2007 Version)\" (featuring Chris Classic)\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|[[United States|US]] ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n!align=\"left\"|62\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) (2007 Version)\"\n!align=\"left\"|66\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Bad Day\"\n!align=\"left\"|67\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Funkytown\" \n!align=\"left\"|86\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Witch Doctor (2007 Version)\" (featuring Chris Classic)\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|US [[Hot Digital Songs]]\n!align=\"left\"|16\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) (2007 Version)\"\n!align=\"left\"|28\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"Bad Day\"\n!align=\"left\"|51\n|}\n\n===Track listing===\nA soundtrack sampler was released along with the DVD of the film in a two pack sold exclusively at Walmart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.walmart.com/1336/9185976/alvin-and-the-chipmunks-2007-with-soundtrack-sampler-cd-full-frame-widescreen-reviews/reviews.htm|title=Customer Reviews|publisher=Walmart}}</ref> This features five songs produced exclusively for the soundtrack.\n{{tracklist\n| headline         = Track listing<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Alvin-Chipmunks-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000YK5BZU Alvin And The Chipmunks -

Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process. In recent years, the villagers have supplemented the income earned from fishing by collecting 'toddy', or palm sap, which is used to brew [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]].<ref name=\"gv\" />\n\n==Zones and neighborhood==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Athgala\n*Basiyawatte\n*Bolawalana <ref>{{cite web|title=Bolawalana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Bolawalana,+Negombo/@7.2010284,79.8496734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eef72d6450d5:0x6c7b59d175d8a34b}}</ref> \n*Dalupotha \n*Daluwakotuwa\n*Dungalpitiya\n*Duwa\n*Duwane\n*Ethukala <ref>{{cite web|title= Ethukala |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Ethukala,+Negombo/@7.2320684,79.8402233,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb163654703:0x20a21aba22188162}}</ref>\n*Kadolkale\n*Kamachchodai <ref>{{cite web|title= Kamachchode |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kamachchode,+Negombo/@7.2139989,79.8259948,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee9f2f0cbe0f:0x73288c5878ca247b}}</ref>\n*[[Kandawala, Negombo|Kandawala]]\n*Kattuwa <ref>{{cite web|title= Kattuwa |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kattuwa,+Negombo/@7.2239664,79.8284387,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeba04148e07:0xbf6a9b4cf339268b}}</ref>\n*Katuwapitiya <ref>{{cite web|title=Katuwapitiya|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Katuwapitiya,+Negombo/@7.2115705,79.8615422,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eee6055fc955:0x738a691b89b342bc}}</ref>\n*Kimbulapitiya \n*Kochchikade\n*Kurana <ref>{{cite web|title= Kurana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kurana,+Negombo/@7.1904851,79.8507839,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee596f4df825:0x130028b2ec5135cb}}</ref> \n*Kudapadu\n*Mahahunupitiya, also known as Maha Hunupitiya, a predominantly Catholic neighborhood<ref>{{cite web|title= Mahunupitiya |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Mahunupitiya,+Negombo/@7.1892061,79.8617362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee50a347a401:0x638b5450d9c6331c}}</ref><ref name=22Apr>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/asia/sri-lanka-blast-victims.html|title=Why Kill the Innocents?|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019|first1=|last1=|first2=|last2=|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n*Munnakkarai \n*Muruthena\n*Nugawala\n*Palangathura\n*Pallansena\n*Periyamulla <ref>{{cite web|title= Periyamulla |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Periyamulla,+Negombo/@7.221981,79.8428607,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb94826a1e3:0x6e7016123f2b139c}}</ref> \n*Pitipana \n*Poruthota\n*Raheemanabad <ref>{{cite web|title= Raheemanabad |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Rahumanabath,+Negombo/@7.2200783,79.8478043,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eebf0f86fa7d:0x2ad2ba2874a4ec13}}</ref> \n*Sarakkuwa\n*Sellakanda\n*Thillanduwa\n*Thaladuwa\n*Thalahena\n*Udyar Thoppu <ref>{{cite web|title= Udayar Thoppuwa|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Udayar+Thoppuwa,+Negombo/@7.215488,79.8340627,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeea8f3c0335:0x6fc86e34b3c6fa0a}}</ref> \n*Wella veediya\n*Welihena\n*Kadirana\n*Akkarapanaha\n*Thimbirigaskatuwa\n*Katana\n{{div col end|3}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:SL Negombo asv2020-01 img02 Dutch canal.jpg|thumb|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fisherman to get to the sea, Dutch canal in Negombo]]\nThe [[E03 expressway (Sri Lanka)|Airport Expressway]] (E03) opened in 2013 links the capital [[Colombo]] through the Katunayake Interchange with Negombo city minimising travelling time to approximately 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n[[File:Negombo bus terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Negombo bus terminal]]\nThere are highway bus services running between from Negombo to Galle and Matara (the southern tip of the country)  using the Southern Expressway.\n\nThe [[A3 road (Sri Lanka)|A3]] main road from [[Colombo]], goes through Negombo, extends to [[Jaffna]], and [[Trincomalee]] via [[Anuradhapura]].

Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process. In recent years, the villagers have supplemented the income earned from fishing by collecting 'toddy', or palm sap, which is used to brew [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]].<ref name=\"gv\" />\n\n==Zones and neighborhood==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Athgala\n*Basiyawatte\n*Bolawalana <ref>{{cite web|title=Bolawalana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Bolawalana,+Negombo/@7.2010284,79.8496734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eef72d6450d5:0x6c7b59d175d8a34b}}</ref> \n*Dalupotha \n*Daluwakotuwa\n*Dungalpitiya\n*Duwa\n*Duwane\n*Ethukala <ref>{{cite web|title= Ethukala |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Ethukala,+Negombo/@7.2320684,79.8402233,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb163654703:0x20a21aba22188162}}</ref>\n*Kadolkale\n*Kamachchodai <ref>{{cite web|title= Kamachchode |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kamachchode,+Negombo/@7.2139989,79.8259948,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee9f2f0cbe0f:0x73288c5878ca247b}}</ref>\n*[[Kandawala, Negombo|Kandawala]]\n*Kattuwa <ref>{{cite web|title= Kattuwa |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kattuwa,+Negombo/@7.2239664,79.8284387,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeba04148e07:0xbf6a9b4cf339268b}}</ref>\n*Katuwapitiya <ref>{{cite web|title=Katuwapitiya|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Katuwapitiya,+Negombo/@7.2115705,79.8615422,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eee6055fc955:0x738a691b89b342bc}}</ref>\n*Kimbulapitiya \n*Kochchikade\n*Kurana <ref>{{cite web|title= Kurana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kurana,+Negombo/@7.1904851,79.8507839,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee596f4df825:0x130028b2ec5135cb}}</ref> \n*Kudapadu\n*Mahahunupitiya, also known as Maha Hunupitiya, a predominantly Catholic neighborhood<ref>{{cite web|title= Mahunupitiya |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Mahunupitiya,+Negombo/@7.1892061,79.8617362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee50a347a401:0x638b5450d9c6331c}}</ref><ref name=22Apr>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/asia/sri-lanka-blast-victims.html|title=Why Kill the Innocents?|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019|first1=|last1=|first2=|last2=|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n*Munnakkarai \n*Muruthena\n*Nugawala\n*Palangathura\n*Pallansena\n*Periyamulla <ref>{{cite web|title= Periyamulla |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Periyamulla,+Negombo/@7.221981,79.8428607,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb94826a1e3:0x6e7016123f2b139c}}</ref> \n*Pitipana \n*Poruthota\n*Raheemanabad <ref>{{cite web|title= Raheemanabad |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Rahumanabath,+Negombo/@7.2200783,79.8478043,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eebf0f86fa7d:0x2ad2ba2874a4ec13}}</ref> \n*Sarakkuwa\n*Sellakanda\n*Thillanduwa\n*Thaladuwa\n*Thalahena\n*Udyar Thoppu <ref>{{cite web|title= Udayar Thoppuwa|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Udayar+Thoppuwa,+Negombo/@7.215488,79.8340627,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeea8f3c0335:0x6fc86e34b3c6fa0a}}</ref> \n*Wella veediya\n*Welihena\n*Kadirana\n*Akkarapanaha\n*Thimbirigaskatuwa\n*Katana\n{{div col end|3}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:SL Negombo asv2020-01 img02 Dutch canal.jpg|thumb|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fisherman to get to the sea, Dutch canal in Negombo]]\nThe [[E03 expressway (Sri Lanka)|Airport Expressway]] (E03) opened in 2013 links the capital [[Colombo]] through the Katunayake Interchange with Negombo city minimising travelling time to approximately 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n[[File:Negombo bus terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Negombo bus terminal]]\nThere are highway bus services running between from Negombo to Galle and Matara (the southern tip of the country)  using the Southern Expressway.\n\nThe [[A3 road (Sri Lanka)|A3]] main road from [[Colombo]], goes through Negombo, extends to [[Jaffna]], and [[Trincomalee]] via [[Anuradhapura]].

{"title_page": "List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of alternative ''Dungeons & Dragons'' classes}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2008}}\nThis is a list of alternative base [[character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]] to the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' role-playing game. As base classes rather than [[prestige class]]es, they can be taken by newly created characters without need for any prerequisites.\n\nMany of these classes have been repeatedly added after the core rules books were released, including the [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|shaman]], [[Artificer (Dungeons & Dragons)|artificer]], and [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|runecaster or runepriest]].\n\n==Original ''Dungeons & Dragons''==\nTwo new classes were introduced after the release of the original D&D boxed set: Thieves in Supplement I - Greyhawk and Bards in The Strategic Review. New subclasses were introduced in Supplement I - [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]], Supplement II - [[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]], Supplement III - [[Eldritch Wizardry]] and the Strategic Review.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Sourcebook || New classes and subclasses\n|-\n| Supplement I - [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] || Thief, Paladin (Fighting Man)\n|-\n| Supplement II - [[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]] || Assassin (Thief), Monk (Cleric)\n|-\n| Supplement III - [[Eldritch Wizardry]] || Druid (Cleric)\n|-\n| The Strategic Review - Volume 1, Number 2 || Ranger (Fighting Man)\n|-\n| The Strategic Review - Volume 1, Number 4 || Illusionist (Magic-user)\n|-\n| The Strategic Review - Volume 2, Number 1 || Bard\n|}\n\n==''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 1st edition==\nFive standard base classes and five subclasses were offered in the ''Player's Handbook'', with an optional 6th base class, the Bard, presented in an appendix. Additionally, various alternative base classes, subclasses and rule changes were offered in the magazine ''Dragon'' and elsewhere, such as the Mystic and the Witch. Eventually, some of these alternative rules came to be compiled in 1985 in the volume ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]''. Among other changes, it included the [[thief-acrobat]], a Thief subclass, and the [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]], a Fighter subclass which had abilities such as summoning a horde of fellow barbarians to any location. ''Unearthed Arcana'' also included the [[Cavalier (Dungeons & Dragons)|cavalier]] class as \"alignment champions\" and reworked Paladins to be a subclass of Cavalier. The thief-acrobat, barbarian, and cavalier had previously appeared in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine. Many existing classes were also drastically reworked and given different abilities. The Barbarian and Cavalier both had revised treatment in ''Dragon'' Magazine #148.<ref>{{cite journal|title=none|last=Howery|first=David|journal=Dragon Magazine|date=August 1989|volume=148}}</ref>  The other major book that offered new base classes was the 1985 version of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]''; it included the Bushi, Kensai, Ninja, Samurai, Shukenja, Sohei, [[Wu jen|Wu Jen]], and Yakuza. Dragonlance Adventures presented alternative classes for Knights of Solamnia (Knight of the Crown, Knight of the Sword and Knight of the Rose) and Wizards of High Sorcery, as well as the Tinker class, which is exclusive to [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|Gnomes]].\n\n===NPCs===\nMost NPCs did not technically have a class in 1st and 2nd edition; they were, instead, \"0th level characters\" or \"hirelings.\" Most classes gained the ability to attract and recruit hirelings at 9th level and later; others could be hired for a fee. Their abilities were not normally laid out very specifically, leaving more to the Dungeon Master's improvisation. First Edition did have a few \"quasi-classes\" which acted in a similar fashion. For example, humanoids could become shamans and witch doctors, which were functionally equivalent to clerics and cleric/magic-users except highly limited in terms of maximum level advancement.\n\n==Basic ''Dungeons & Dragons''==\nThe \"Basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' line introduced the Mystic, a counterpart to the ''AD&D'' [[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]], in the [[Dungeons & Dragons Master Set|''Master Set'']] as available from first level. Additionally, the [[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|''Companion Set'']] introduced a version of the Druid as an option for advancing a neutrally [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|aligned]] cleric of ninth level or higher, and the Paladin, Knight, and Avenger as specialized paths for Fighters above ninth level of lawful, neutral, or chaotic alignment respectively.\n\nOptional classes, both human and demi-human, were introduced in the [[Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteer|''Gazetteer'']] series of setting accessories, and include the Dervish (GAZ2), Elf Wizard (GAZ5), TreeKeeper (GAZ5), Dwarf-Cleric (GAZ6), Wise Woman (GAZ7), Master (GAZ8), Merchant-Prince (GAZ9), Kobold (GAZ10), Goblin (GAZ10), Orc (GAZ10), Hobgoblin (GAZ10), Gnoll (GAZ10), Bugbear (GAZ10), Ogre (GAZ10), Troll (GAZ10), Merchant (GAZ11), Shaman (GAZ12), Shadow Elf (GAZ13), Shadow Elf Shaman (GAZ13), and Shamani (GAZ14)\n\n==''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 2nd edition==\n''AD&D'' 2nd edition introduced a large number of alternative classes in various supplemental handbooks, which also introduced a variety of \"kits\" to customize each base class. These kits would grant certain new special abilities at the cost of various restrictions. On occasion the concept of class vs. kit seemed to blur, for example, the Sha'ir of [[Al-Qadim]] was introduced as a wizard kit, but it had very different abilities from other wizards, and an alternative system of spellcasting, which warranted it being a class, and not a mere kit. It was treated as its own class in the release of ''[[The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook]]''. As can be seen on the lists below, 2nd Edition had far more alternative classes than 1st Edition, and provided significant flexibility with dozens of kits.\n\nThe most common type of variant class was the specialty priest, which applied to almost all settings. Rules for specialty priests were in the 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook'', with the druid offered as an example, and many campaign settings offered detailed abilities and domains for specialty priests of their deities.\n\n===2nd edition alternative classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Sourcebook\n!Classes\n|-\n|[[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]] campaign setting\n|Magician (''[[Birthright Campaign Setting]]'' box set), Guilder ([[Havens of the Great Bay]] expansion)\n|-\n|[[Celts Campaign Sourcebook]]\n|Manteis\n|-\n|[[Chronomancer (accessory)|Chronomancer]]\n|Chronomancer, Temporal Champion, Temporal Raider\n|-\n|Cult of the Dragon\n|Incantatrix\n|-\n|Dark Sun Campaign Setting\n|Defiler, Elemental Cleric, Gladiator, Para-elemental Cleric, Templar, Trader\n|-\n|[[Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas|Defilers and Preservers - The Wizards of Athas]]\n|Dragon, Avangion\n|-\n|[[Domains of Dread]]\n|Anchorite, Arcanist, Avenger, Gypsy\n|-\n|Dragonlance Campaign Setting\n|Handler, Tinker, Commoner, Knight of Solamnia, Barbarian (Plains/Ice), Cavalier, Mariner, Wizard of High Sorcery, Holy Order of the Stars\n|-\n|[[Faiths & Avatars]]\n|Crusader, Monk, Mystic, Shaman\n|-\n|[[Legends & Lore]]\n|Ascetic, Pious Knight\n|-\n|[[Netheril: Empire of Magic]]\n|Arcanist\n|-\n|[[Sages & Specialists]]\n|Apothecary, Appraiser, Blacksmith, Cartographer, Engineer, Guide, Healer, Historian, Scribe, Seer\n|-\n|[[Shaman (accessory)|Shaman]]\n|Solitary Shaman, Spiritualist, Tribal Shaman\n|-\n|[[Skills & Powers]]\n|Alchemist, Geometer, Shadow Mage, Song Wizard\n|-\n|[[Spells & Magic]]\n|Artificer, Crusader, Dimensionalist, Force Mage, Mentalist, Monk, Shaman\n|-\n|[[The Complete Barbarian's Handbook]]\n|Barbarian Fighter, Shaman\n|-\n|[[The Complete Druid's Handbook]]\n|Arctic Druid, Desert Druid, Gray Druid, Forest Druid, Jungle Druid, Mountain Druid, Plains Druid, Swamp Druid\n|-\n|[[The Complete Ninja's Handbook]]\n|Ninja (Spy/Killer)\n|-\n|[[The Complete Psionics Handbook]]\n|Psionicist\n|-\n|[[Tome of Magic]]\n|Elementalist, Wild Mage\n|-\n|[[Vikings Campaign Sourcebook]]\n|Berserker, Runecaster\n|-\n|[[Giantcraft]]\n|Runecaster\n|-\n|[[Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales]]\n|Adept, Soldier, Mystic, Tradesman\n|-\n|[[Warriors and Priests of the Realms]]\n|Harper, Crusader\n|-\n|[[Wizards and Rogues of the Realms]]\n|Spellsinger, Shadow Walker\n|-\n|[[The Scarlet Brotherhood]]\n|Assassin, Monk\n|-\n|}\n\n===2nd edition kits===\nCharacter kits were conceived as a way for players to customize a class. A character kit is a collection of minor modifications to the standard rules (generally involving bonus languages, changes to forbidden/permissible weapons, bonus non-weapon proficiencies, et cetera). They tended to reflect culture, race, social class, or vocation.\n\nKit repetition was also not unheard of. Some kit names were used multiple times, occasionally with different descriptions, such as the diplomat. Kits and classes also sometimes duplicated themselves. For example, the shaman appeared in at least six products.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Sourcebook\n!Kits\n|-\n|Age of Heroes Campaign Sourcebook\n|Companion, Hero, Hoplite\n|-\n|A Mighty Fortress

systems could be seen as new character classes. The system of channeling seems to have been an exception, this was purely an alternative form of handling spell casting, and gives the example of a \"channeling invoker\". In other words, the class is invoker, but instead of using the normal method of spell casting, the character uses a different version, and for sake of clarity, is labeled a channeling invoker. The other alternative systems (Alienist/Summoner, Warlock/Wizard) lend themselves more readily to the concept of alternative classes in addition to an alternative form of spell casting (much as the Wild Mage and Defiler classes use modified means of casting spells). The book also introduced different spell systems for priests, but all of them were, like the wizardly form of channeling, of a nature that suggested a different way of handling spell casting (and acquisition) as opposed to outright classes.\n\n==3rd and 3.5 editions==\n{{excessive detail|section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===''Dungeon Master's Guide''===\nIn its ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', 3rd edition introduced five [[Non-player character|NPC]] classes not intended for player use. These were the first official alternative base classes, and still the only ones detailed in the core 3 books. All five of these classes were retained in the 3.5 edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Statistics\n|-\n|Adept\n|Adepts are practitioners of divine magic, similar to [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Clerics]], but are less formally trained. They typically arise in poorer or frontier areas, and are common among bestial humanoids as their link to their deity. Unlike Clerics, who possess decent physical combat ability, Adepts' physical combat capabilities are poor.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/adept.htm OGL stats]<br>\n[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/dmag_gallery/100212.jpg Image]\n|-\n|Aristocrat\n|The Aristocrat class reflects those of a wealthy and refined upbringing. While nobles commonly meet the description, rich and educated commoners can as well. Due to their extensive education, good diet, and reasonable medical care, Aristocrats possess a wide variety of skills, are reasonably tough, and possess familiarity with combat and martial weapons.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/aristocrat.htm OGL stats]<br>\n[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/sharn_gallery/84609.jpg Image]\n|-\n|Commoner\n|Commoners are unskilled average folk and comprise the bulk of the non-player characters of most settings, existing as peasants and laborers. They possess practically no skill at combat and have no special abilities.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/commoner.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|Expert\n|Experts are skilled common people, such as tradesmen, scholars, and educated merchants. They possess considerable acumen at their areas of expertise, and receive a large amount of skill points to reflect this. While more familiar with combat than Commoners, Experts are only familiar with the simplest of weapons.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/expert.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|Warrior\n|Warriors are trained for combat, similar to [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighters]]. However, they possess more casual training, similar to that given to a town guard or low-ranking army recruit. This is reflected in their lesser rate of hit point growth than fighters and their lack of special abilities.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/warrior.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|}\n\n===Other sourcebooks===\nThe following base classes were introduced in other sourcebooks.

Binders then fuse with the vestige, which affects their appearance (and possibly their personality) but grants them powers that can usually be used an unlimited number of times per day. This pact-making is despised by most clerics, because the gods were the ones who exiled most of the vestiges in the first place. Binder is the favored class of karsites, a new race introduced in ''Tome of Magic''.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Crusader\n|Crusader is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, and White Raven styles; Devoted Spirit is exclusive to Crusaders alone. Crusaders may only use a randomized selection of maneuvers at the start of battle; they gain the rest one round at a time.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon Shaman]]\n|Dragon Shamans earn their power by making a pact with a specific breed of dragon. Over time, they slowly begin to grow more like their chosen Totem dragon: they gain a draconic aura, can heal wounds similar to a Paladin's Lay on Hands ability, their skin becomes scales, they gain a dragon's breath, and lastly a dragon's wings. They must remain within one step of their chosen Dragon's alignment.\n|''[[Player's Handbook II]]''\n|-\n|Dragonfire Adept\n|Dragonfire Adepts receive spell-like invocations through some form of draconic tie, such as in-born talent, study, or from a deal with a dragon. This includes the ability to use a variety of elemental breath attacks. Despite not casting magic, their abilities are still hindered by armor.\n|''[[Dragon Magic]]''\n|-\n|[[Necromancer (Dungeons & Dragons)#Necromancer|Dread Necromancer]]\n|Dread Necromancers are focused students of undeath, fear-inducing magic, and evil-aligned spells. They cast spells spontaneously like a Sorcerer and do not have the breadth of a specialist wizard necromancer. Dread necromancers are also more combat-oriented than most arcane spellcasters, able to wear light armor without impacting their spells and possessing numerous abilities. Eventually, a Dread Necromancer can become a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]].\n|''[[Heroes of Horror]]''\n|-\n|Duskblade\n|Duskblades combine combat prowess with the ability to cast arcane magic while in light or medium armor. Their spell selection is limited and generally focused on a single target; however, their spells get a bonus against enemies whom they have struck in melee combat. They cast spells spontaneously, like a Sorcerer, but their spells are based on Intelligence, like a Wizard.<ref name=\"duskblade\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://archive.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/cwc/20060905a \n |title=Character Class: Duskblade -- Master of Sword and Spell \n |accessdate=2007-05-02 \n |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] \n |year=2006 \n |author=Williams, Skip \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110181650/http://archive.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2Fcwc%2F20060905a \n |archivedate=2014-11-10 \n}}</ref>\n|''[[Player's Handbook II]]''\n|-\n|Factotum\n|Factotums are jacks-of-all-trades and possess a variety of abilities. They can imitate other classes for a short time.\n|''[[Dungeonscape]]''\n|-\n|Favored Soul\n|The favored soul is similar to a cleric, but they may cast divine spells they know spontaneously, similar to a Sorcerer. They also acquire characteristics similar to their patron deity, such as expertise in their deity's favored weapons, and eventually grow wings. Favored Soul is one of the few classes with three good saves.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Miniatures Handbook]]'', ''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|Healer\n|Healers are divine spellcasters similar to clerics. Their spells focus on healing and removing conditions such as fatigue, fear, and paralysis. Healers also gain similar supernatural abilities and the services of a celestial companion, usually a unicorn. Like druids, healers are prohibited from wearing metal armor; healers are further prohibited from using shields. Healers must be of good alignment and may not refuse to heal an ally or good-aligned creature.\n|''[[Miniatures Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Hexblade\n|Hexblades are warriors who possess some arcane magic ability, which they may use while wearing armor and cast spontaneously. They may also curse their opponents and, at higher levels, inflict an aura of unluck upon them.\n|''[[Complete Warrior]]''\n|-\n|Incarnate\n|Incarnates are characters that have learned to form soulmelds, magical items made from Incarnum, the material of souls. They gain the ability to shape soulmelds and bind them to different chakras, or body regions. This binding grants them additional abilities based on the soulmeld and chakra combination. Incarnates must be either Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Good, or Neutral Evil, and some of their abilities change with alignment. It is the favored class of the Rilkan and Skarn race.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Knight\n|Knights are dedicated melee combatants based around protecting other characters, distracting enemies, and high resilience. Their main ability is the \"Knight's Challenge,\" which can boost the morale of allies, goad strong enemies into fighting him or her, and scare weak enemies.

They also use ''ki'' similar to a monk and can turn invisible.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Samurai (Dungeons & Dragons)|Samurai]]\n|Loosely based on the Japanese [[samurai]], the Samurai in ''Oriental Adventures'' are those who learn a particular martial style from their clan. They possess a number of bonus feats, which must be taken from styles favored by their clan. Samurai may also sacrifice and empower their ancestral [[daisho]], turning their family's weapons into magical ones in their hands. Samurai must be of lawful alignment.

They possess a skirmish ability that allows them to do extra damage when moving.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shaman]]\n|Shamans are divine spellcasters who draw their spells from the spirit world.\n|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)''\n|-\n|Shadowcaster\n|Shadowcasters are spellcasters that draw power from the [[Plane of Shadow]]. They learn \"mysteries\" which start out similar to spells, though over time simpler mysteries become spell-like abilities and can be used more often per day. Eventually shadowcasters become immune to poisons and disease and no longer need to eat, sleep, or breathe.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Shugenja\n|Shugenja are loosely based on [[List of Asian mythologies|Asian mythology]] and are mechanically similar to traditional Clerics. Typically members of the noble class, Shugenja are spontaneous casters of magic. Shugenja are attuned to one of the four [[classical element]]s in particular; they are barred from learning spells of the opposed element. Through concentration, they can sense any element nearby in a radius that grows with experience.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)'', ''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|[[Sohei (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sohei]]\n|Sohei are militant religious warriors; they usually act in groups and are primarily employed by large temples and monasteries. They can shrug off a certain amount of damage and deflect arrows, and may also enter a \"ki frenzy\" of focused fury. Soheis must be of lawful alignment.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #318\n|-\n|Soulborn\n|Soulborns utilize magic items called \"soulmelds\" to increase their own skills and abilities, though they have a more limited selection than Totemists or Incarnates.

Azurin have Soulborn as a favored class.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Spellthief\n|Spellthieves are a rogue-like class that acquires slightly fewer skills than rogues, but their sneak attack ability can steal spells or magical abilities from others. They also can detect magic and have a small chance of absorbing enemy magic harmlessly.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Spirit Shaman]]\n|Spirit Shamans are similar to druids in that they use the druidic spell list, but they cast spells spontaneously like a Sorcerer. Spirit Shamans have their own spirit guide and possess special abilities that affect spirits (such as incorporeal undead, fey, and elementals). Unlike Sorcerers, Spirit Shamans may change their spell selection whenever they meditate to regain their daily allotment of spells.\n|''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|Swashbuckler\n|Based on a 2nd edition kit for Fighters and Thieves, Swashbucklers are a combat-oriented class that emphasizes finesse, style, and flair. They are surprisingly tough and have a Fighter's rate of attack bonus advancement, but can only wear light armor. Swashbucklers also gain a fair number of skills.\n|''[[Complete Warrior]]''\n|-\n|Swordsage\n|Swordsage is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon and Tiger Claw styles.

They must spend a full round to recover one special maneuver.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|Totemist\n|Totemists revere magical beasts, such as worgs and unicorns, whom they see as the most powerful forces of nature. They shape incarnum, the material of souls, to make magical items based around magical beasts, such as Displacer Mantles. Totemist is the favored class of Dusklings.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Truenamer\n|Truenamers are a type of wizard whose magic revolves around a primordial language that describes the universe. As they learn the [[true name]] of entities, they become able to affect them by \"rewriting the universe.\" Mechanically, they are similar to sorcerers, except a Truenamer's skills affect the DC of their spell.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Warblade\n|Warblade is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw and White Raven styles. The Warblade focuses on melee combat and can utilize light and medium armors and shields. They may acquire fighter-exclusive feats as if they were a fighter two levels lower than their Warblade level and recover maneuvers with a simple attack or by spending a turn.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|[[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)|Warlock]]\n|Warlocks are users of spell-like abilities either in-born or granted through a pact with some unearthly being such as a demon or a fey. Since a warlock's invocations are not normal spells, they may be used while wearing light armor and any number of times.

They are a cross between rogues (for skills and dirty tricks) and fighters (attack bonus) who have developed at skills specific to those on board ships.\n|-\n|Master\n|Masters are Krynn's enhanced version of experts. More talented, with skills unmatched in their chosen fields, masters are on par with other PC classes. They must specialize in a set of broad skills (craft, knowledge, perform or profession).  They receive bonus skill-related feats and special talents akin to feats.\n|-\n|Mystic\n|Mystics are capable of casting divine spells without need of being a cleric; they are mechanically similar to a Sorcerer in that they cast spontaneously, but from a fixed spell list chosen from the spell list for clerics. This ability was important when Krynn was isolated from the gods for a time.\n|-\n|Nightstalker\n|Nightstalkers create magical effects, find traps, and see dead people.\n|-\n|Noble\n|Nobles are charismatic manipulators who leverage skills and connections to advance their goals. They are mechanically similar to rogues without the ability to sneak attack, and can call in favors they earn.\n|-\n|}\n\n;Eberron\nAlternative base classes presented in the 3.5 edition [[Eberron]] campaign setting include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Source\n|-\n|Artificer\n|Artificers are tinkerers and architects skilled at creating and modifying items. They cast \"infusions\" onto ordinary items and constructs so that they grant a bonus to themselves or their wielders. They also are familiar with security, able to tinker with traps and locks. [[Dragonmarked house#House Cannith|House Cannith]] is known for their skill in this class.\n|[[Eberron Campaign Setting]]\n|-\n|Magewright\n|Magewrights are crafters of magical items. They are familiar with some magic, especially that which would aid the creation of other items. The Magewright class is intended for [[non-player character]]s.\n|[[Eberron Campaign Setting]]\n|-\n|Psionic Artificer\n|Psionic variant of the artificer class.\n|''[[Magic of Eberron]]''\n|-\n|Urban Adept\n|Urban variant of the adept NPC class.\n|''[[Sharn: City of Towers]]''\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[Al-Qadim]] setting was not extensively supported in 3rd edition, but issue 315 of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'' includes an update to the [[Sha' ir]] base class from earlier editions.\n\nThe 3rd edition version of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' was set in [[Rokugan]], the setting of ''Legend of the Five Rings''. However, many of the classes in ''Oriental Adventures'' were used in other settings as well, and some were reprinted in other books independently. Alternative classes created for that book include the Samurai, Shaman, Shugenja, Sohei, and Wu-Jen; see above.\n\n====Generic classes====\nThe 2004 release of ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' for 3.5 edition included 3 \"generic\" base classes: Warrior, Spellcaster, and Expert (no relation to the DMG's Warrior and Expert). These classes cover three basic archetypes without any frills and are easily modified. However, these classes were not recommended for use with the standard base classes. The Warrior is similar to the Fighter, with hit points and a strong attack but few skills; the Expert has a large variety of skills but middling combat capabilities (similar to a Rogue); and the Spellcaster has little combat capabilities but the ability to cast spells (similar to a Wizard). Many class features from the core base classes, such as Familiar, Sneak Attack and Turn Undead, are available to the three generic base classes as bonus feats.\n\n====Psionics-related====\n{{main|Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n[[Psionics]] in 3rd edition were originally detailed in ''[[Psionics Handbook]]''. 2nd edition had only one character class, the psionicist; 3rd edition renamed it the psion and introduced various new alternative classes based on psionics usage. ''Psionics Handbook'' was later updated for version 3.5 with the ''Expanded Psionics Handbook'', and new material was added in the ''[[Complete Psionic]]'' book.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Source\n|-\n|Ardent\n|Ardents derive their powers from a focus on primal truths or concepts (\"mantles\"); different mantles offer different abilities to an Ardent. They possess a smaller selection of powers than the more versatile Psion, but enjoy greater martial abilities.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Divine Mind\n|The Divine Mind is a character who chooses to serve a deity using psionic powers; they are thus somewhat similar to Clerics. Like clerics, they may choose mantles a deity represents, similar to domains. They may also exude Attack, Defense, or Perception auras that grant bonuses to nearby allies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20060918 |title=Character class: Divine Mind|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110174718/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fcwc%2F20060918 |archivedate=2014-11-10 }}</ref>\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Erudite\n|Rather than learn powers upon level gain like Psions, Erudites may theoretically use any psionic ability by \"copying\" another person or a psionically-infused item.

Mechanically, they are thus somewhat similar to unspecialized wizards rather than Psions.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Lurk\n|Lurks are similar to rogues who call upon psionic powers to aid them. They may perceive the weaknesses of enemies and make sneak attacks, as well as use psionic augments to their abilities.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Psion\n|Psions are dedicated to the usage of psionic power. Mechanically, they are similar to Sorcerers; however, like Wizards, they can (and in fact must) choose a specialization of their school of psionics. In 3rd edition the various disciplines were each linked to a statistic; for instance, clairsentience is linked to Wisdom and Psions who specialize in it are known as Seers. This was changed in 3.5 so that all disciplines are linked to the Intelligence statistic. Psion is the favoured class of the elan race.\n|''[[Psionics Handbook]]'', ''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Psychic Rogue\n|Psychic Rogue is a Rogue with psionic abilities.\n|http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20040723b\n|-\n|Psychic Warrior\n|Psychic Warriors are a blend between Fighters and Psions. Like fighters, they gain bonus feats, and like psions, they wield psionic powers, though at a slower rate than either specialized class. Their attack bonus and hit point growth is similarly in the middle.\n|''[[Psionics Handbook]]'', ''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Soulknife\n|Soulknives are warriors who have learned to channel psionic power into \"Mindblades\", or swords composed of psionic energy. Their broad training allows them to take many occupations and be a \"jack of all trades.\" It is the favoured class of the Xeph race. Soulknives were a prestige class in the original ''Psionics Handbook'', but made into a base class with version 3.5.\n|''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Wilder\n|Wilders can use \"wild surges\", which allow them to augment their psionic powers to a greater extent than normal. Doing so is dangerous and there is a chance every time a wild surge is used that the wilder will suffer from \"psychic enervation\" causing them to become dazed and lose power points. They are slightly tougher than psions, but gain fewer abilities and slower. Wilder is the favored class of the [[maenad]] race.\n|''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|}\n\n==4th edition==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

As base classes rather than [[prestige class]]es, they can be taken by newly created characters without need for any prerequisites.\n\nMany of these classes have been repeatedly added after the core rules books were released, including the [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|shaman]], [[Artificer (Dungeons & Dragons)|artificer]], and [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|runecaster or runepriest]].\n\n==Original ''Dungeons & Dragons''==\nTwo new classes were introduced after the release of the original D&D boxed set: Thieves in Supplement I - Greyhawk and Bards in The Strategic Review. New subclasses were introduced in Supplement I - [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]], Supplement II - [[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]], Supplement III - [[Eldritch Wizardry]] and the Strategic Review.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Additionally, various alternative base classes, subclasses and rule changes were offered in the magazine ''Dragon'' and elsewhere, such as the Mystic and the Witch. Eventually, some of these alternative rules came to be compiled in 1985 in the volume ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]''. Among other changes, it included the [[thief-acrobat]], a Thief subclass, and the [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]], a Fighter subclass which had abilities such as summoning a horde of fellow barbarians to any location. ''Unearthed Arcana'' also included the [[Cavalier (Dungeons & Dragons)|cavalier]] class as \"alignment champions\" and reworked Paladins to be a subclass of Cavalier. The thief-acrobat, barbarian, and cavalier had previously appeared in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine. Many existing classes were also drastically reworked and given different abilities. The Barbarian and Cavalier both had revised treatment in ''Dragon'' Magazine #148.<ref>{{cite journal|title=none|last=Howery|first=David|journal=Dragon Magazine|date=August 1989|volume=148}}</ref>  The other major book that offered new base classes was the 1985 version of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]''; it included the Bushi, Kensai, Ninja, Samurai, Shukenja, Sohei, [[Wu jen|Wu Jen]], and Yakuza. Dragonlance Adventures presented alternative classes for Knights of Solamnia (Knight of the Crown, Knight of the Sword and Knight of the Rose) and Wizards of High Sorcery, as well as the Tinker class, which is exclusive to [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|Gnomes]].\n\n===NPCs===\nMost NPCs did not technically have a class in 1st and 2nd edition; they were, instead, \"0th level characters\" or \"hirelings.\" Most classes gained the ability to attract and recruit hirelings at 9th level and later; others could be hired for a fee. Their abilities were not normally laid out very specifically, leaving more to the Dungeon Master's improvisation. First Edition did have a few \"quasi-classes\" which acted in a similar fashion. For example, humanoids could become shamans and witch doctors, which were functionally equivalent to clerics and cleric/magic-users except highly limited in terms of maximum level advancement.\n\n==Basic ''Dungeons & Dragons''==\nThe \"Basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' line introduced the Mystic, a counterpart to the ''AD&D'' [[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]], in the [[Dungeons & Dragons Master Set|''Master Set'']] as available from first level. Additionally, the [[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|''Companion Set'']] introduced a version of the Druid as an option for advancing a neutrally [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|aligned]] cleric of ninth level or higher, and the Paladin, Knight, and Avenger as specialized paths for Fighters above ninth level of lawful, neutral, or chaotic alignment respectively.\n\nOptional classes, both human and demi-human, were introduced in the [[Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteer|''Gazetteer'']] series of setting accessories, and include the Dervish (GAZ2), Elf Wizard (GAZ5), TreeKeeper (GAZ5), Dwarf-Cleric (GAZ6), Wise Woman (GAZ7), Master (GAZ8), Merchant-Prince (GAZ9), Kobold (GAZ10), Goblin (GAZ10), Orc (GAZ10), Hobgoblin (GAZ10), Gnoll (GAZ10), Bugbear (GAZ10), Ogre (GAZ10), Troll (GAZ10), Merchant (GAZ11), Shaman (GAZ12), Shadow Elf (GAZ13), Shadow Elf Shaman (GAZ13), and Shamani (GAZ14)\n\n==''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 2nd edition==\n''AD&D'' 2nd edition introduced a large number of alternative classes in various supplemental handbooks, which also introduced a variety of \"kits\" to customize each base class. These kits would grant certain new special abilities at the cost of various restrictions. On occasion the concept of class vs. kit seemed to blur, for example, the Sha'ir of [[Al-Qadim]] was introduced as a wizard kit, but it had very different abilities from other wizards, and an alternative system of spellcasting, which warranted it being a class, and not a mere kit. It was treated as its own class in the release of ''[[The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook]]''. As can be seen on the lists below, 2nd Edition had far more alternative classes than 1st Edition, and provided significant flexibility with dozens of kits.\n\nThe most common type of variant class was the specialty priest, which applied to almost all settings. Rules for specialty priests were in the 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook'', with the druid offered as an example, and many campaign settings offered detailed abilities and domains for specialty priests of their deities.\n\n===2nd edition alternative classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Sourcebook\n!Classes\n|-\n|[[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]] campaign setting\n|Magician (''[[Birthright Campaign Setting]]'' box set), Guilder ([[Havens of the Great Bay]] expansion)\n|-\n|[[Celts Campaign Sourcebook]]\n|Manteis\n|-\n|[[Chronomancer (accessory)|Chronomancer]]\n|Chronomancer, Temporal Champion, Temporal Raider\n|-\n|Cult of the Dragon\n|Incantatrix\n|-\n|Dark Sun Campaign Setting\n|Defiler, Elemental Cleric, Gladiator, Para-elemental Cleric, Templar, Trader\n|-\n|[[Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas|Defilers and Preservers - The Wizards of Athas]]\n|Dragon, Avangion\n|-\n|[[Domains of Dread]]\n|Anchorite, Arcanist, Avenger, Gypsy\n|-\n|Dragonlance Campaign Setting\n|Handler, Tinker, Commoner, Knight of Solamnia, Barbarian (Plains/Ice), Cavalier, Mariner, Wizard of High Sorcery, Holy Order of the Stars\n|-\n|[[Faiths & Avatars]]\n|Crusader, Monk, Mystic, Shaman\n|-\n|[[Legends & Lore]]\n|Ascetic, Pious Knight\n|-\n|[[Netheril: Empire of Magic]]\n|Arcanist\n|-\n|[[Sages & Specialists]]\n|Apothecary, Appraiser, Blacksmith, Cartographer, Engineer, Guide, Healer, Historian, Scribe, Seer\n|-\n|[[Shaman (accessory)|Shaman]]\n|Solitary Shaman, Spiritualist, Tribal Shaman\n|-\n|[[Skills & Powers]]\n|Alchemist, Geometer, Shadow Mage, Song Wizard\n|-\n|[[Spells & Magic]]\n|Artificer, Crusader, Dimensionalist, Force Mage, Mentalist, Monk, Shaman\n|-\n|[[The Complete Barbarian's Handbook]]\n|Barbarian Fighter, Shaman\n|-\n|[[The Complete Druid's Handbook]]\n|Arctic Druid, Desert Druid, Gray Druid, Forest Druid, Jungle Druid, Mountain Druid, Plains Druid, Swamp Druid\n|-\n|[[The Complete Ninja's Handbook]]\n|Ninja (Spy/Killer)\n|-\n|[[The Complete Psionics Handbook]]\n|Psionicist\n|-\n|[[Tome of Magic]]\n|Elementalist, Wild Mage\n|-\n|[[Vikings Campaign Sourcebook]]\n|Berserker, Runecaster\n|-\n|[[Giantcraft]]\n|Runecaster\n|-\n|[[Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales]]\n|Adept, Soldier, Mystic, Tradesman\n|-\n|[[Warriors and Priests of the Realms]]\n|Harper, Crusader\n|-\n|[[Wizards and Rogues of the Realms]]\n|Spellsinger, Shadow Walker\n|-\n|[[The Scarlet Brotherhood]]\n|Assassin, Monk\n|-\n|}\n\n===2nd edition kits===\nCharacter kits were conceived as a way for players to customize a class. A character kit is a collection of minor modifications to the standard rules (generally involving bonus languages, changes to forbidden/permissible weapons, bonus non-weapon proficiencies, et cetera). They tended to reflect culture, race, social class, or vocation.\n\nKit repetition was also not unheard of. Some kit names were used multiple times, occasionally with different descriptions, such as the diplomat. Kits and classes also sometimes duplicated themselves. For example, the shaman appeared in at least six products.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Sourcebook\n!Kits\n|-\n|Age of Heroes Campaign Sourcebook\n|Companion, Hero, Hoplite\n|-\n|A Mighty Fortress

systems could be seen as new character classes. The system of channeling seems to have been an exception, this was purely an alternative form of handling spell casting, and gives the example of a \"channeling invoker\". In other words, the class is invoker, but instead of using the normal method of spell casting, the character uses a different version, and for sake of clarity, is labeled a channeling invoker. The other alternative systems (Alienist/Summoner, Warlock/Wizard) lend themselves more readily to the concept of alternative classes in addition to an alternative form of spell casting (much as the Wild Mage and Defiler classes use modified means of casting spells). The book also introduced different spell systems for priests, but all of them were, like the wizardly form of channeling, of a nature that suggested a different way of handling spell casting (and acquisition) as opposed to outright classes.\n\n==3rd and 3.5 editions==\n{{excessive detail|section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===''Dungeon Master's Guide''===\nIn its ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', 3rd edition introduced five [[Non-player character|NPC]] classes not intended for player use. These were the first official alternative base classes, and still the only ones detailed in the core 3 books. All five of these classes were retained in the 3.5 edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Statistics\n|-\n|Adept\n|Adepts are practitioners of divine magic, similar to [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Clerics]], but are less formally trained. They typically arise in poorer or frontier areas, and are common among bestial humanoids as their link to their deity. Unlike Clerics, who possess decent physical combat ability, Adepts' physical combat capabilities are poor.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/adept.htm OGL stats]<br>\n[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/dmag_gallery/100212.jpg Image]\n|-\n|Aristocrat\n|The Aristocrat class reflects those of a wealthy and refined upbringing. While nobles commonly meet the description, rich and educated commoners can as well. Due to their extensive education, good diet, and reasonable medical care, Aristocrats possess a wide variety of skills, are reasonably tough, and possess familiarity with combat and martial weapons.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/aristocrat.htm OGL stats]<br>\n[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/sharn_gallery/84609.jpg Image]\n|-\n|Commoner\n|Commoners are unskilled average folk and comprise the bulk of the non-player characters of most settings, existing as peasants and laborers. They possess practically no skill at combat and have no special abilities.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/commoner.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|Expert\n|Experts are skilled common people, such as tradesmen, scholars, and educated merchants. They possess considerable acumen at their areas of expertise, and receive a large amount of skill points to reflect this. While more familiar with combat than Commoners, Experts are only familiar with the simplest of weapons.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/expert.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|Warrior\n|Warriors are trained for combat, similar to [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighters]]. However, they possess more casual training, similar to that given to a town guard or low-ranking army recruit. This is reflected in their lesser rate of hit point growth than fighters and their lack of special abilities.\n|[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/npcClasses/warrior.htm OGL stats]<br>\n|-\n|}\n\n===Other sourcebooks===\nThe following base classes were introduced in other sourcebooks.

They study and learn spells with a prayerbook, analogous to a wizard's spellbook, and their magic's strength is based on Intelligence. Archivists also have the Dark Knowledge class feature, which allows them to draw on their knowledge of aberrations, elementals, magical beasts, outsiders or undead with a successful skill check, most Dark Knowledge abilities grant allies an offensive or defensive bonus.<ref>[http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20051007a&page=3 Heroes of Horror excerpt: Archivist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111031816/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fex%2F20051007a&page=3 |date=2014-11-11 }}</ref>\n|''[[Heroes of Horror]]''\n|-\n|Beguiler\n|Beguilers are similar to rogues, but possess a small suite of spells cast spontaneously, like a Sorcerer.

Binders then fuse with the vestige, which affects their appearance (and possibly their personality) but grants them powers that can usually be used an unlimited number of times per day. This pact-making is despised by most clerics, because the gods were the ones who exiled most of the vestiges in the first place. Binder is the favored class of karsites, a new race introduced in ''Tome of Magic''.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Crusader\n|Crusader is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, and White Raven styles; Devoted Spirit is exclusive to Crusaders alone. Crusaders may only use a randomized selection of maneuvers at the start of battle; they gain the rest one round at a time.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon Shaman]]\n|Dragon Shamans earn their power by making a pact with a specific breed of dragon. Over time, they slowly begin to grow more like their chosen Totem dragon: they gain a draconic aura, can heal wounds similar to a Paladin's Lay on Hands ability, their skin becomes scales, they gain a dragon's breath, and lastly a dragon's wings. They must remain within one step of their chosen Dragon's alignment.\n|''[[Player's Handbook II]]''\n|-\n|Dragonfire Adept\n|Dragonfire Adepts receive spell-like invocations through some form of draconic tie, such as in-born talent, study, or from a deal with a dragon. This includes the ability to use a variety of elemental breath attacks. Despite not casting magic, their abilities are still hindered by armor.\n|''[[Dragon Magic]]''\n|-\n|[[Necromancer (Dungeons & Dragons)#Necromancer|Dread Necromancer]]\n|Dread Necromancers are focused students of undeath, fear-inducing magic, and evil-aligned spells. They cast spells spontaneously like a Sorcerer and do not have the breadth of a specialist wizard necromancer. Dread necromancers are also more combat-oriented than most arcane spellcasters, able to wear light armor without impacting their spells and possessing numerous abilities. Eventually, a Dread Necromancer can become a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]].\n|''[[Heroes of Horror]]''\n|-\n|Duskblade\n|Duskblades combine combat prowess with the ability to cast arcane magic while in light or medium armor. Their spell selection is limited and generally focused on a single target; however, their spells get a bonus against enemies whom they have struck in melee combat. They cast spells spontaneously, like a Sorcerer, but their spells are based on Intelligence, like a Wizard.<ref name=\"duskblade\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://archive.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/cwc/20060905a \n |title=Character Class: Duskblade -- Master of Sword and Spell \n |accessdate=2007-05-02 \n |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] \n |year=2006 \n |author=Williams, Skip \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110181650/http://archive.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2Fcwc%2F20060905a \n |archivedate=2014-11-10 \n}}</ref>\n|''[[Player's Handbook II]]''\n|-\n|Factotum\n|Factotums are jacks-of-all-trades and possess a variety of abilities. They can imitate other classes for a short time.\n|''[[Dungeonscape]]''\n|-\n|Favored Soul\n|The favored soul is similar to a cleric, but they may cast divine spells they know spontaneously, similar to a Sorcerer. They also acquire characteristics similar to their patron deity, such as expertise in their deity's favored weapons, and eventually grow wings. Favored Soul is one of the few classes with three good saves.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Miniatures Handbook]]'', ''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|Healer\n|Healers are divine spellcasters similar to clerics. Their spells focus on healing and removing conditions such as fatigue, fear, and paralysis. Healers also gain similar supernatural abilities and the services of a celestial companion, usually a unicorn. Like druids, healers are prohibited from wearing metal armor; healers are further prohibited from using shields. Healers must be of good alignment and may not refuse to heal an ally or good-aligned creature.\n|''[[Miniatures Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Hexblade\n|Hexblades are warriors who possess some arcane magic ability, which they may use while wearing armor and cast spontaneously. They may also curse their opponents and, at higher levels, inflict an aura of unluck upon them.\n|''[[Complete Warrior]]''\n|-\n|Incarnate\n|Incarnates are characters that have learned to form soulmelds, magical items made from Incarnum, the material of souls. They gain the ability to shape soulmelds and bind them to different chakras, or body regions. This binding grants them additional abilities based on the soulmeld and chakra combination. Incarnates must be either Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Good, or Neutral Evil, and some of their abilities change with alignment. It is the favored class of the Rilkan and Skarn race.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Knight\n|Knights are dedicated melee combatants based around protecting other characters, distracting enemies, and high resilience. Their main ability is the \"Knight's Challenge,\" which can boost the morale of allies, goad strong enemies into fighting him or her, and scare weak enemies.

Ninjas are focused on stealth and mobility, and possess a sudden strike special attack on unprepared foes. They also use ''ki'' similar to a monk and can turn invisible.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Samurai (Dungeons & Dragons)|Samurai]]\n|Loosely based on the Japanese [[samurai]], the Samurai in ''Oriental Adventures'' are those who learn a particular martial style from their clan. They possess a number of bonus feats, which must be taken from styles favored by their clan. Samurai may also sacrifice and empower their ancestral [[daisho]], turning their family's weapons into magical ones in their hands. Samurai must be of lawful alignment. The class was revisited in ''Complete Warrior'', but in a markedly different style dedicated to two-weapon combat.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)'', ''[[Complete Warrior]]''\n|-\n|Scout\n|Scouts are experts at tracking and natural lore, and are similar to a more wilderness-oriented rogue. They possess a skirmish ability that allows them to do extra damage when moving.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shaman]]\n|Shamans are divine spellcasters who draw their spells from the spirit world.\n|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)''\n|-\n|Shadowcaster\n|Shadowcasters are spellcasters that draw power from the [[Plane of Shadow]]. They learn \"mysteries\" which start out similar to spells, though over time simpler mysteries become spell-like abilities and can be used more often per day. Eventually shadowcasters become immune to poisons and disease and no longer need to eat, sleep, or breathe.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Shugenja\n|Shugenja are loosely based on [[List of Asian mythologies|Asian mythology]] and are mechanically similar to traditional Clerics. Typically members of the noble class, Shugenja are spontaneous casters of magic. Shugenja are attuned to one of the four [[classical element]]s in particular; they are barred from learning spells of the opposed element. Through concentration, they can sense any element nearby in a radius that grows with experience.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)'', ''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|[[Sohei (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sohei]]\n|Sohei are militant religious warriors; they usually act in groups and are primarily employed by large temples and monasteries. They can shrug off a certain amount of damage and deflect arrows, and may also enter a \"ki frenzy\" of focused fury. Soheis must be of lawful alignment.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Oriental Adventures]] (3rd)'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #318\n|-\n|Soulborn\n|Soulborns utilize magic items called \"soulmelds\" to increase their own skills and abilities, though they have a more limited selection than Totemists or Incarnates. Soulmelds are made from Incarnum, the material of which souls consist. Soulborns must be of an \"extreme\" alignment: one of Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Chaotic Evil. Azurin have Soulborn as a favored class.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Spellthief\n|Spellthieves are a rogue-like class that acquires slightly fewer skills than rogues, but their sneak attack ability can steal spells or magical abilities from others. They also can detect magic and have a small chance of absorbing enemy magic harmlessly.\n|''[[Complete Adventurer]]''\n|-\n|[[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Spirit Shaman]]\n|Spirit Shamans are similar to druids in that they use the druidic spell list, but they cast spells spontaneously like a Sorcerer. Spirit Shamans have their own spirit guide and possess special abilities that affect spirits (such as incorporeal undead, fey, and elementals). Unlike Sorcerers, Spirit Shamans may change their spell selection whenever they meditate to regain their daily allotment of spells.\n|''[[Complete Divine]]''\n|-\n|Swashbuckler\n|Based on a 2nd edition kit for Fighters and Thieves, Swashbucklers are a combat-oriented class that emphasizes finesse, style, and flair. They are surprisingly tough and have a Fighter's rate of attack bonus advancement, but can only wear light armor. Swashbucklers also gain a fair number of skills.\n|''[[Complete Warrior]]''\n|-\n|Swordsage\n|Swordsage is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon and Tiger Claw styles. Swordsages may only use light armor and have a slightly slower attack bonus progression, but are the most versatile of the martial adepts. They must spend a full round to recover one special maneuver.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|Totemist\n|Totemists revere magical beasts, such as worgs and unicorns, whom they see as the most powerful forces of nature. They shape incarnum, the material of souls, to make magical items based around magical beasts, such as Displacer Mantles. Totemist is the favored class of Dusklings.\n|''[[Magic of Incarnum]]''\n|-\n|Truenamer\n|Truenamers are a type of wizard whose magic revolves around a primordial language that describes the universe. As they learn the [[true name]] of entities, they become able to affect them by \"rewriting the universe.\" Mechanically, they are similar to sorcerers, except a Truenamer's skills affect the DC of their spell.\n|''[[Tome of Magic]]''\n|-\n|Warblade\n|Warblade is a martial adept class, meaning it utilizes the various boosts, counters, strikes, and stances in ''[[Tome of Battle]]''. They may learn the Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw and White Raven styles. The Warblade focuses on melee combat and can utilize light and medium armors and shields. They may acquire fighter-exclusive feats as if they were a fighter two levels lower than their Warblade level and recover maneuvers with a simple attack or by spending a turn.\n|''[[Tome of Battle]]''\n|-\n|[[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)|Warlock]]\n|Warlocks are users of spell-like abilities either in-born or granted through a pact with some unearthly being such as a demon or a fey. Since a warlock's invocations are not normal spells, they may be used while wearing light armor and any number of times. Warlocks can later acquire energy resistance, toughened skin, fast healing, and the ability to force magical items to do their bidding.\n|''[[Complete Arcane]]''\n|-\n|Warmage\n|Warmages are battle-oriented mages associated with large army battles who focus on damage-dealing spells. They may cast spells while wearing light (and later, medium) armor.\n|style=\"font-size:85%\"|''[[Miniatures Handbook]]'', ''[[Complete Arcane]]''\n|-\n|[[Wu Jen]]\n|Wu Jen are Eastern-style wizards introduced in both versions of ''Oriental Adventures''.

They are a cross between rogues (for skills and dirty tricks) and fighters (attack bonus) who have developed at skills specific to those on board ships.\n|-\n|Master\n|Masters are Krynn's enhanced version of experts. More talented, with skills unmatched in their chosen fields, masters are on par with other PC classes. They must specialize in a set of broad skills (craft, knowledge, perform or profession).  They receive bonus skill-related feats and special talents akin to feats.\n|-\n|Mystic\n|Mystics are capable of casting divine spells without need of being a cleric; they are mechanically similar to a Sorcerer in that they cast spontaneously, but from a fixed spell list chosen from the spell list for clerics. This ability was important when Krynn was isolated from the gods for a time.\n|-\n|Nightstalker\n|Nightstalkers create magical effects, find traps, and see dead people.\n|-\n|Noble\n|Nobles are charismatic manipulators who leverage skills and connections to advance their goals. They are mechanically similar to rogues without the ability to sneak attack, and can call in favors they earn.\n|-\n|}\n\n;Eberron\nAlternative base classes presented in the 3.5 edition [[Eberron]] campaign setting include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Source\n|-\n|Artificer\n|Artificers are tinkerers and architects skilled at creating and modifying items. They cast \"infusions\" onto ordinary items and constructs so that they grant a bonus to themselves or their wielders. They also are familiar with security, able to tinker with traps and locks. [[Dragonmarked house#House Cannith|House Cannith]] is known for their skill in this class.\n|[[Eberron Campaign Setting]]\n|-\n|Magewright\n|Magewrights are crafters of magical items. They are familiar with some magic, especially that which would aid the creation of other items. The Magewright class is intended for [[non-player character]]s.\n|[[Eberron Campaign Setting]]\n|-\n|Psionic Artificer\n|Psionic variant of the artificer class.\n|''[[Magic of Eberron]]''\n|-\n|Urban Adept\n|Urban variant of the adept NPC class.\n|''[[Sharn: City of Towers]]''\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[Al-Qadim]] setting was not extensively supported in 3rd edition, but issue 315 of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'' includes an update to the [[Sha' ir]] base class from earlier editions.\n\nThe 3rd edition version of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' was set in [[Rokugan]], the setting of ''Legend of the Five Rings''. However, many of the classes in ''Oriental Adventures'' were used in other settings as well, and some were reprinted in other books independently. Alternative classes created for that book include the Samurai, Shaman, Shugenja, Sohei, and Wu-Jen; see above.\n\n====Generic classes====\nThe 2004 release of ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' for 3.5 edition included 3 \"generic\" base classes: Warrior, Spellcaster, and Expert (no relation to the DMG's Warrior and Expert). These classes cover three basic archetypes without any frills and are easily modified. However, these classes were not recommended for use with the standard base classes. The Warrior is similar to the Fighter, with hit points and a strong attack but few skills; the Expert has a large variety of skills but middling combat capabilities (similar to a Rogue); and the Spellcaster has little combat capabilities but the ability to cast spells (similar to a Wizard). Many class features from the core base classes, such as Familiar, Sneak Attack and Turn Undead, are available to the three generic base classes as bonus feats.\n\n====Psionics-related====\n{{main|Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n[[Psionics]] in 3rd edition were originally detailed in ''[[Psionics Handbook]]''. 2nd edition had only one character class, the psionicist; 3rd edition renamed it the psion and introduced various new alternative classes based on psionics usage. ''Psionics Handbook'' was later updated for version 3.5 with the ''Expanded Psionics Handbook'', and new material was added in the ''[[Complete Psionic]]'' book.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Class\n!Description\n!Source\n|-\n|Ardent\n|Ardents derive their powers from a focus on primal truths or concepts (\"mantles\"); different mantles offer different abilities to an Ardent. They possess a smaller selection of powers than the more versatile Psion, but enjoy greater martial abilities.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Divine Mind\n|The Divine Mind is a character who chooses to serve a deity using psionic powers; they are thus somewhat similar to Clerics. Like clerics, they may choose mantles a deity represents, similar to domains. They may also exude Attack, Defense, or Perception auras that grant bonuses to nearby allies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20060918 |title=Character class: Divine Mind|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110174718/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fcwc%2F20060918 |archivedate=2014-11-10 }}</ref>\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Erudite\n|Rather than learn powers upon level gain like Psions, Erudites may theoretically use any psionic ability by \"copying\" another person or a psionically-infused item. In exchange, they may call upon only a limited selection of powers per day. Mechanically, they are thus somewhat similar to unspecialized wizards rather than Psions.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Lurk\n|Lurks are similar to rogues who call upon psionic powers to aid them. They may perceive the weaknesses of enemies and make sneak attacks, as well as use psionic augments to their abilities.\n|''[[Complete Psionic]]''\n|-\n|Psion\n|Psions are dedicated to the usage of psionic power. Mechanically, they are similar to Sorcerers; however, like Wizards, they can (and in fact must) choose a specialization of their school of psionics. In 3rd edition the various disciplines were each linked to a statistic; for instance, clairsentience is linked to Wisdom and Psions who specialize in it are known as Seers. This was changed in 3.5 so that all disciplines are linked to the Intelligence statistic. Psion is the favoured class of the elan race.\n|''[[Psionics Handbook]]'', ''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Psychic Rogue\n|Psychic Rogue is a Rogue with psionic abilities.\n|http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20040723b\n|-\n|Psychic Warrior\n|Psychic Warriors are a blend between Fighters and Psions. Like fighters, they gain bonus feats, and like psions, they wield psionic powers, though at a slower rate than either specialized class. Their attack bonus and hit point growth is similarly in the middle.\n|''[[Psionics Handbook]]'', ''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Soulknife\n|Soulknives are warriors who have learned to channel psionic power into \"Mindblades\", or swords composed of psionic energy. Their broad training allows them to take many occupations and be a \"jack of all trades.\" It is the favoured class of the Xeph race. Soulknives were a prestige class in the original ''Psionics Handbook'', but made into a base class with version 3.5.\n|''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|Wilder\n|Wilders can use \"wild surges\", which allow them to augment their psionic powers to a greater extent than normal. Doing so is dangerous and there is a chance every time a wild surge is used that the wilder will suffer from \"psychic enervation\" causing them to become dazed and lose power points. They are slightly tougher than psions, but gain fewer abilities and slower. Wilder is the favored class of the [[maenad]] race.\n|''[[Expanded Psionics Handbook]]''\n|-\n|}\n\n==4th edition==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \"safe area\", with the winner being the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', itself based on the [[Battle Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]], which presents a [[Battle royale genre|similar theme]] of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.\n\nThe genre's origins arose from [[mod (video gaming)|mods]] for large-scale online survival games like ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[ARMA 2]]'' in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' (2017), ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' (2017) and ''[[Apex Legends]]'' (2019), each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.\n\n==Concept==\nBattle royale games are played between many individual players, pairs of two players or a number of small squads (typically of 3-5 players). In each match, the goal is to be the [[Last man standing (gaming)|last player or team standing]] by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit. The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset. Equipment, usually used for combat, survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in [[ghost town]]s. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on-screen or on the map, requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions. Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well. These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed.\n\nTypically, battle royale contestants are only given one [[Life (gaming)|life]] to play; any players who die are not allowed to [[respawn]]. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to [[glossary of video game terms#revive|revive]] them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent. The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] created for another game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | title = The best battle royale games, modes and mods | first = Fraser | last = Brown | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = September 15, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204216/http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | archivedate = September 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale.

Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \"safe area\", with the winner being the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', itself based on the [[Battle Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]], which presents a [[Battle royale genre|similar theme]] of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.\n\nThe genre's origins arose from [[mod (video gaming)|mods]] for large-scale online survival games like ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[ARMA 2]]'' in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' (2017), ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' (2017) and ''[[Apex Legends]]'' (2019), each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.\n\n==Concept==\nBattle royale games are played between many individual players, pairs of two players or a number of small squads (typically of 3-5 players). In each match, the goal is to be the [[Last man standing (gaming)|last player or team standing]] by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit. The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset. Equipment, usually used for combat, survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in [[ghost town]]s. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on-screen or on the map, requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions. Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well. These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed.\n\nTypically, battle royale contestants are only given one [[Life (gaming)|life]] to play; any players who die are not allowed to [[respawn]]. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to [[glossary of video game terms#revive|revive]] them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent. The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] created for another game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | title = The best battle royale games, modes and mods | first = Fraser | last = Brown | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = September 15, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204216/http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | archivedate = September 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale. For example, ''[[Fortnite]]'' introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to collect resources and weapons towards constructing fortifications as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to eliminate all the players on the other team.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16748276/fortnite-battle-royale-50-vs-50-trailer-date-tga-2017 | title = Fortnite: Battle Royale gets a new 50-versus-50 team mode | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 12, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010918/https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16748276/fortnite-battle-royale-50-vs-50-trailer-date-tga-2017 | archivedate = December 13, 2017| df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early games (2012\u20132016)===\nFormulative elements of the battle royale genre had existed prior the 2010s.

The '''Digital Phone Group''' (\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30db\u30f3, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and '''J-PHONE Co., Ltd.''' (J-\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3) was formed in 1999 by the merging of DGP with Digital TU-KA Group (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused with [[KDDI|TU-KA]]). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%.\n\nJ-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by continuously introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], SkyMelody ringtone download, the famous [[Sha-Mail]] picture mail introduced on the basis of [[camera phones]] developed by [[Sharp Corporation|SHARP]], the mobile multimedia data service [[J-Sky]] modeled after [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]], and advanced [[Java platform|Java]] services based on [[JSCL]], modeled after NTT DoCoMo's [[DoJa]] based i-appli.\n\n===Vodafone===\nIn October 2001, the British mobile phone group [[Vodafone]] increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003, the name of the company and the service brand was officially changed to Vodafone, with the division called '''Vodafone [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]]''' or '''Vodafone Japan'''. The growth and success of the company during this period is due in large part to then-president [[Bill Morrow (executive)|Bill Morrow]].<ref name=\"Bill Morrow Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/18440.php |title=Bill Morrow, Vodafone's turnaround guru, Walks Away|publisher=Cellular-news.com|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, [[au by KDDI]] gained 163,700, and [[Willcom]] gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's [[FOMA]] 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone cut back investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers, and by end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen by 103,100 to 14.996 million, while during the same period NTT DoCoMo had gained 1.65 million customers and KDDI/AU had gained 1.82 million customers. At the end of October 2005, NTT DoCoMo had 17.6 million 3G customers, KDDI/AU had 19.8 million 3G customers, and Vodafone-Japan had 1.9 million 3G customers, i.e. Vodafone-Japan gained about 4.8% of Japan's 3G market.\n\nVodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to [[Vodafone live!]], and used J-Sky's principles and technologies and business models to introduce the [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. Thus Vodafone live! has its origin in J-Phone's J-Sky. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000 to 12,769,600.\n\nIn March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers, as Japanese users tend to have preferences not seen in other markets. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and did not have as many features as competing companies. This led to the loss of more customers and Vodafone's decision that the market was no longer profitable.\n\n===SoftBank Mobile===\n[[File:(Real) TV on Mobile (397712891).jpg|thumb|Television broadcast on a 2007 [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] phone on SoftBank]]\n\nOn 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell its holding of Vodafone Japan (Vodafone K.K.) to SoftBank for about 1.75 trillion Japanese yen (about US$15.1 billion).

The '''Digital Phone Group''' (\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30db\u30f3, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and '''J-PHONE Co., Ltd.''' (J-\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3) was formed in 1999 by the merging of DGP with Digital TU-KA Group (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused with [[KDDI|TU-KA]]). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%.\n\nJ-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by continuously introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], SkyMelody ringtone download, the famous [[Sha-Mail]] picture mail introduced on the basis of [[camera phones]] developed by [[Sharp Corporation|SHARP]], the mobile multimedia data service [[J-Sky]] modeled after [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]], and advanced [[Java platform|Java]] services based on [[JSCL]], modeled after NTT DoCoMo's [[DoJa]] based i-appli.\n\n===Vodafone===\nIn October 2001, the British mobile phone group [[Vodafone]] increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003, the name of the company and the service brand was officially changed to Vodafone, with the division called '''Vodafone [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]]''' or '''Vodafone Japan'''. The growth and success of the company during this period is due in large part to then-president [[Bill Morrow (executive)|Bill Morrow]].<ref name=\"Bill Morrow Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/18440.php |title=Bill Morrow, Vodafone's turnaround guru, Walks Away|publisher=Cellular-news.com|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, [[au by KDDI]] gained 163,700, and [[Willcom]] gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's [[FOMA]] 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone cut back investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers, and by end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen by 103,100 to 14.996 million, while during the same period NTT DoCoMo had gained 1.65 million customers and KDDI/AU had gained 1.82 million customers. At the end of October 2005, NTT DoCoMo had 17.6 million 3G customers, KDDI/AU had 19.8 million 3G customers, and Vodafone-Japan had 1.9 million 3G customers, i.e. Vodafone-Japan gained about 4.8% of Japan's 3G market.\n\nVodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to [[Vodafone live!]], and used J-Sky's principles and technologies and business models to introduce the [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. Thus Vodafone live! has its origin in J-Phone's J-Sky. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000 to 12,769,600.\n\nIn March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers, as Japanese users tend to have preferences not seen in other markets. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and did not have as many features as competing companies. This led to the loss of more customers and Vodafone's decision that the market was no longer profitable.\n\n===SoftBank Mobile===\n[[File:(Real) TV on Mobile (397712891).jpg|thumb|Television broadcast on a 2007 [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] phone on SoftBank]]\n\nOn 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell its holding of Vodafone Japan (Vodafone K.K.) to SoftBank for about 1.75 trillion Japanese yen (about US$15.1 billion).
