The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of [[Metromedia]] mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== Purchase of former parent and acquisitions (2005\u20132014) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Rise of SBC|History of AT&T#Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions}}\nIn 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion.

The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume.

The Bell Telephone Company became the '''American Telephone and Telegraph Company''' in 1885 and was later rebranded as [[AT&T Corporation]]. The 1982 ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'' [[antitrust]] lawsuit resulted in the [[Bell System divestiture|divestiture]] of AT&T Corporation's (\"Ma Bell\") subsidiaries or [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs), commonly referred to as  \"Baby Bells\", resulting in several independent companies, including Southwestern Bell Corporation; the latter changed its name to '''SBC Communications Inc.''' in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased its former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using its history, iconic logo and stock-trading symbol. In 2006, AT&T Inc. acquired [[BellSouth]], the last independent Baby Bell company, making their formerly joint venture [[Cingular|Cingular Wireless]] (which had acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004) wholly owned and rebranding it as [[AT&T Mobility]].\n\nThe current AT&T [[Breakup of the Bell System#Evolution of the Baby Bells|reconstitutes much of the former Bell System]], and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies along with the original [[AT&T Communications|long distance division]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kleinfield |first=Sony |year=1981 |title=The biggest company on earth: a profile of AT&T |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |isbn=978-0-03-045326-7 |oclc= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/biggestcompanyon00klei }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|History of AT&T}}\n\n=== Origin and growth (1885\u20131981) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Origins|History of AT&T#Monopoly}}\nAT&T traces its origins to the [[Bell Telephone Company]], founded by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], and Thomas Sanders after Bell's patenting of the [[telephone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corp.att.com/history/|title=Home{{!}} History{{!}} AT&T|website=www.corp.att.com|language=en|accessdate=March 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105114300/http://www.corp.att.com/history/|archive-date=November 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> One of that company's subsidiaries was the [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T), established in 1885,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corp.att.com/history/nethistory/milestones.html|title=History of the AT&T Network \u2014 Milestones in AT&T Network History{{!}} History{{!}} AT&T|website=www.corp.att.com|language=en|accessdate=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617093145/https://www.corp.att.com/history/nethistory/milestones.html|archive-date=June 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899, for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company.

The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of [[Metromedia]] mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the [[Fortune 500]], and by 1999 the company was part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== Purchase of former parent and acquisitions (2005\u20132014) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Rise of SBC|History of AT&T#Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions}}\nIn 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T Corp. still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T Corp.'s history (dating to 1885) as its own.

His legal last name Gyenne-Adams came from the first name of his paternal uncle Adam, and his preferred last name Gyenne-Bayere is reflective of the clans his parents came from within the [[Bissa people|Bissa ethnic group]] of West Africa. He and his four sisters were raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] household by his single mother. According to Mubarik's song titled \"Because Winter (feat. Lowell Boland)\", he was four years old when his father passed away. The family regularly moved between shelters throughout [[Ontario]]. As a child he attended Gateway Public Elementary School while living in [[Toronto]] before moving to Port Credit where he attended Riverside Public Elementary School. He lived in [[Brampton]] briefly where he attended [[Bramalea Secondary School]] before settling in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] where he attended [[Glendale Secondary School]].\n\nAccording to Emay he \"spent most of his childhood living in the Vendome patch of [[Flemingdon Park]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then later moved to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] when he was in grade 5. Mubarik was first exposed to [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] when his immigrant cousin Nasara would constantly listen to [[Nas]] while living in the Vendome residence. His mother would listen to a lot of [[West African music|West African]], [[Reggae]], [[Disco]], Pop, [[Country music|Country]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[religious music]]. Emay was a huge fan of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] when he was in elementary school, and would stick tissue into his mothers [[cassette tape]]s to record their music off of the radio. After Mubarik moved to [[Brampton]] in grade 5, he was no longer a fan of [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] as much and would recreate melodies on his sisters digital [[MIDI keyboard]]. He also began listening to [[jazz]] and classical music from the radio. When he reached grade 8, he became intrigued with [[Southern hip hop|southern hip-hop]], and was a big fan of [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle label]], and artists like [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]], [[UGK]], and [[Boosie Badazz|Lil' Boosie]]. As he progressed through high school he began listening to more [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] and [[Underground hip hop|underground hip-hop]] acts such as [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz & A.G.]], and [[MF Doom]]. In 2006, he began creating instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] in attempt to mimic his favourite producers and artists. Mubarik learned how to create instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] after his online mentors Lion and Gravity gave him tips and advice. His online mentors also assisted him with his [[rapping]] as well. As he completed high school, he began listening to a lot more different genres including Classical, [[Classic rock music|Classic Rock]], [[Grunge]], [[Emo]], [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]], and more.\"\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Career Beginnings ===\nThe mixtape was also promoted by the music blog and independent record label Vinyl Meltdown.

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state.

Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n* Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.

(Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' that garnered online attention and led to his signing with independent music blog and record label Vinyl Meltdown.\n\nIn 2010, Emay joined and released content with three different collaboration projects, which expanded Emay's connections in the music industry and lead to multiple collaboration with British hip hop artist [[Star Slinger]].<ref name=\":13\" /> The collaborations caught the attention of a blog called Potholes in my Blog and the [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine's]] [[Pigeons & Planes]]\u2014both of which would go on to consistently promote Emay's music.<ref name=\":38\" />\n\nEmay's first extended play to be widely recognized was released in 2014 and was entitled ''Sinner, Song-Writer''.<ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":46\" /> Emay's debut full-length album entitled ''Ilah'' was released in 2017 to overwhelmingly positive reviews and lead to Emay being interviewed by a number of music news outlets and music magazines.<ref name=\":53\" /><ref name=\":54\" /><ref name=\":55\" /><ref name=\":49\" /><ref name=\":50\" /><ref name=\":51\" />  \n\n== Early life ==\nMubarik Gyenne-Adams (preferred name Mubarik Gyenne-Bayere) was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] on December 18, 1991, the son of a couple who had immigrated to Canada from [[Ghana]] in the late 1980s. His legal last name Gyenne-Adams came from the first name of his paternal uncle Adam, and his preferred last name Gyenne-Bayere is reflective of the clans his parents came from within the [[Bissa people|Bissa ethnic group]] of West Africa. He and his four sisters were raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] household by his single mother. According to Mubarik's song titled \"Because Winter (feat. Lowell Boland)\", he was four years old when his father passed away. The family regularly moved between shelters throughout [[Ontario]]. As a child he attended Gateway Public Elementary School while living in [[Toronto]] before moving to Port Credit where he attended Riverside Public Elementary School. He lived in [[Brampton]] briefly where he attended [[Bramalea Secondary School]] before settling in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] where he attended [[Glendale Secondary School]].\n\nAccording to Emay he \"spent most of his childhood living in the Vendome patch of [[Flemingdon Park]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then later moved to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] when he was in grade 5. Mubarik was first exposed to [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] when his immigrant cousin Nasara would constantly listen to [[Nas]] while living in the Vendome residence. His mother would listen to a lot of [[West African music|West African]], [[Reggae]], [[Disco]], Pop, [[Country music|Country]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[religious music]]. Emay was a huge fan of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] when he was in elementary school, and would stick tissue into his mothers [[cassette tape]]s to record their music off of the radio. After Mubarik moved to [[Brampton]] in grade 5, he was no longer a fan of [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] as much and would recreate melodies on his sisters digital [[MIDI keyboard]]. He also began listening to [[jazz]] and classical music from the radio. When he reached grade 8, he became intrigued with [[Southern hip hop|southern hip-hop]], and was a big fan of [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle label]], and artists like [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]], [[UGK]], and [[Boosie Badazz|Lil' Boosie]]. As he progressed through high school he began listening to more [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] and [[Underground hip hop|underground hip-hop]] acts such as [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz & A.G.]], and [[MF Doom]]. In 2006, he began creating instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] in attempt to mimic his favourite producers and artists. Mubarik learned how to create instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] after his online mentors Lion and Gravity gave him tips and advice. His online mentors also assisted him with his [[rapping]] as well. As he completed high school, he began listening to a lot more different genres including Classical, [[Classic rock music|Classic Rock]], [[Grunge]], [[Emo]], [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]], and more.\"\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Career Beginnings ===\nAccording to various profile biographies on numerous small streaming services as well as an interview on Revolutionary Left Radio, Mubarik began his musical career in 2006 at the age of fifteen. Leading up to his first major project, Mubarik focused on music production instead of emceeing and decided on the pseudonym Emay\u2014the phonetic spelling of his initials\u2014for his solo project. For the release of A.D.D., Mubarik stylized his stage name as EmAy, however, he never used the stylized spelling after 2008. Many of the biographies compare Emay to [[Pete Rock]], [[Madlib]], [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]], [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], and 9th Wonder. Additionally, many of the biographies identify his music as [[Downtempo]], [[Electronica]], [[Chill-out music|Chillout]], [[Trip hop|Trip-Hop]], [[Emceeing]], and [[Conscious hip-hop]]. Emay emphasized multiple times on his [[Last.fm]] account biography that he was more interested in his music being known than the person behind the music.\n\nThe full-length album entitled ''A.D.D. (Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' was released in the fall of 2008 and was distributed as a digital download on Emay's [[Myspace]] account and [[DatPiff]], however there has been some confusion as to the mixtapes exact release date. The mixtape was also promoted by the music blog and independent record label Vinyl Meltdown, which would continue to follow and promote Emay's music until the website shut down in 2015. The mixtape was entirely made up of remixed content by well-known artists such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy of Mobb Deep]], [[Nas]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], and [[Eminem]]. The mixtape created some online activity and local buzz, but was not widely purchased or downloaded. The title of the mixtape is the acronym A.D.D., which is a reference to Mubarik's experiences with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit disorder]] as well as the nature of the mixtape impulsively skipping from one artist's sample to another. The album artwork for the mixtape was illustrated by Chase Miles.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|title=Free Music Archive: Emay|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=July 29, 2010|website=Free Music Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215201751/https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|archive-date=February 15, 2020|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====== Child (Refugee) ======\nOn October 17, 2009 the single entitled ''Child (Refugee)'' was released under the independent record label entitled Vinyl Meltdown and Judge Mental Music. The release was made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single included the instrumental and a cappella versions as well as a bonus track entitled \"Surfin'\". The single included the first recorded verses to be written and performed by Emay as opposed to his sampling of other artists. The single's production elements and heart-wrenching story were received well, but critics responded negatively to the rapping style. The album artwork for the single was done by Austin Menard from Vinyl Meltdown, who would continue to work with Emay for about a year.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====== Collaborations and Emay, Karen O, and The Kids ======\nIn 2009, Mubarik discovered the mixtape entitled ''La Guapa'' by Ivan Ice\u2014a Dutch music producer\u2014and after connecting online the two decided to work on a collaboration project called Ivan Ice & Emay. On February 11, 2010 the promotional single entitled ''Ze Drums'' along with the a cappella version was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single was positively received by blogs and music critics. Later that month, on February 23, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Sounds Like'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork for both the single and extended play were done by Austin Menard. The extended play also garnered positive reviews from multiple blogs and music critics. The collaboration's music was featured on both Beatbox Radio Show and Under the Radar Radio Show. The song \"Get Ready\" was later selected to be on The Find Magazine's sequel playlist entitled Hazy Dreams II with Emay being mentioned as one of the highlights of the playlist.\n\nOn February 13, 2010 the song \"Worried Shoes\" was leaked by Potholes in My Blog to promote Emay's upcoming album. On April 26, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Emay, Karen O, and the Kids'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork was done by Theodore Taylor III. The album remixed six different tracks taken off of the ''[[Where the Wild Things Are: Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''\u2014originally composed by [[Karen O]]. The mixtape deviated from Emay's previous works as it was Emay's first [[instrumental]] content and the genre was identified as [[electronica]] rather than [[hip hop]] or [[Rapping|rap]]. The mixtape was praised by critics and blogs as being Emay's best work to date with the song \"Igloo\" as the album's highlight.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|title=Off the Charts: Emay, Willie Nile, Davis-Coltrane|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|date=December 26, 2014|website=The Billings Gazette|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125082012/https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|archive-date=January 25, 2015|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEmay joined another collaboration project in 2010 called RockPaperScissors consisting of Emay, EOM also known as Elements of Music, and Remot.<ref name=\":36\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|title=Emay biography|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=October 8, 2010|website=Last.fm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320141234/https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|archive-date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> On July 24, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Rock.

At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself Canadian, but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to Edmonton in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nOn October 3, 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation. A white woman was attempting to physically harm a black taxi driver while yelling obscenities, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on Facebook where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police Hate Crime Unit]] and the woman has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] organization that Mubarik became involved in was called the Young Communist League a revisionist group in Canada where Mubarik met some members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]]. This would lead to Mubarik eventually support the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]] and a more [[Revolutionary|revolutionary ideology]]. Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n* Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.
