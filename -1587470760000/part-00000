The city is home to [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute]], [[Presbyterian Health Services]], and both the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[Central New Mexico Community College]] have their main campuses in the city. Albuquerque is the center of the New Mexico Technology Corridor, a concentration of high-tech institutions, including the metropolitan area being the location of [[Intel]]'s [[List of Intel manufacturing sites|Fab 11X]] In [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]] and a [[Facebook]] Data Center in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]], Albuquerque was also the founding location of [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] and [[Microsoft]].

Located in [[Downtown Albuquerque]] are historic theaters such as the [[KiMo Theater]], and near the [[Albuquerque Plaza|Civic Plaza]] is the [[Al Hurricane]] Pavilion and [[Albuquerque Convention Center]] with its Kiva Auditorium. Due to its population size, the metropolitan area regularly receives most national and international music concerts, [[Broadway show]]s, and other large traveling events, as well as [[New Mexico music]], and [[Music of New Mexico|other local music performances]].\n\nLikewise, due to the metropolitan size, it is home to a diverse restaurant scene from various [[global cuisine]]s, and the state's distinct [[New Mexican cuisine]]. Being the focus of the [[Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District]] gives an agricultural contrast, along [[acequia]]s, to the otherwise heavily urban setting of the city. Crops such as [[New Mexico chile]] are grown along the entire Rio Grande, the red or green chile pepper is a staple of the aforementioned New Mexican cuisine. The Albuquerque metro is a major contributor of the [[Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA]] with [[New Mexico wine]] produced at several vineyards, it is also home to several [[List of breweries in New Mexico|New Mexican breweries]].

In 1902, the famous Alvarado Hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.\n\nNew Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period.

''Sand\u00eda'' is Spanish for \"[[watermelon]]\", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', \"the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo.\"<ref name=\"julyan\">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', \"big mountain.\"<ref name=\"julyan\"/>\n\nThe Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.\n\nBelow the foothills, the area usually called the \"Northeast Heights\" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.\n\nThe last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including \"West Bluff\", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as \"blow sand\", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.\n\n===Potential and former native flora===\nFlora or vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of their desert southwestern and interior west setting, within the varied elevations and terrain. The limits are by significant urbanization, including much infill development occurring in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nSandy soils include scrub and mesa vegetation such as sand sagebrush (''Artemisia filifolia''), fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens''). Some similar grass and seasonal wildflower species occur that also occur in areas east of the Rio Grande, but in much lower densities. Sparsely as well, sandy soil grasses occur such as Indian ricegrass (''Oryzopsis hymenoides''), sand dropseed (''Sporobolus cryptandrus''), and mesa dropseed (''Sporobolus flexuosus''). Arroyos contain desert willow (''Chilopsis linearis'') while breaks and the prominent volcanic escarpment include threeleaf sumac with less frequent stands of oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii'').

In the lower foothills of the Sandia Mountains loose or granitic soils help provide habitat for other species, such as feather dalea (''Dalea formosa''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902003239/https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |archive-date=September 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSoaptree (''Yucca elata'') and broom dalea (''Psorothamnus scoparius'') are currently found or were once existing on sand hills and breaks on both sides of the Rio Grande Valley, roughly below the present-day locations of the Petroglyph Escarpment west of Coors Road and along Interstate 25 south of Sunport Boulevard.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley proper bisects Albuquerque, and it has been urbanized the longest of all areas of the city. Some botanists and longtime residents <ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson, 2004 and earlier</ref> recall riparian vegetation, including screwbean mesquite or tornillo (''Prosopis pubescens''), Gooding's willow (''Salix goodingii''), and saint sacaton (''Sporobulus wrightii''). The present bosque or gallery forest of Rio Grande cottonwood (''Populus deltoides var. wislizeni'') and coyote willow (''Salix exigua'') is theorized to have been more savannah-like, prior to replanting in the 1930s. Grass and low cactus cover of many areas is typical of a broader region of the intermontane west riparian zones, such as saltgrass (''Distychilis spp.'') and alkali sacaton (''Sporobulus airoides''). Discontinuous, small stands of New Mexico olive (''Forestiera pubescens var. neomexicana''), Arizona walnut (''Juglans major''), and Arizona ash (''Fraxinus velutina'') can be seen near bosque areas and near former river bends in central New Mexico just north and south of the Albuquerque city limits in the Corrales bosque and along former channels of the Rio Grande in Valencia and Socorro counties. The forest now has a large proportion of non-native species including [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]], [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]], [[Tamarix|saltcedar]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]], [[Ailanthus altissima|Ailanthus]], and [[Saccharum ravennae|ravenna grass]]. Some restoration to native species is occurring, similar to the limited species of ''Populus'' and ''Salix'' used in the 1930s.\n\nOne prominent species of native Mountainous trees is the [[pinyon pine|pi\u00f1on pine]]. At the east end of the city, the Sandia foothills receive about 50 percent more precipitation than most of the city, and with granitic, coarse soils, rock outcrops, and boulders dominant, they have a greater and different diversity of flora in the form of savanna and chaparral, dominated by lower and middle zones of New Mexico Mountains vegetation, with a slight orientation at lower elevations. Dominant plants include shrub or desert live oak (''Quercus turbinella''), gray oak (''Quercus grisea''), hairy mountain mahogany (''Cercocarpus breviflorus''), oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), pi\u00f1on (''Pinus edulis''), threeleaf sumac (''Rhus trilobata''), Engelmann prickly pear (''Opuntia engelmannii''), juniper prickly pear (''Opuntia hystricina var. juniperiana''), and beargrass (''Nolina greenei'', formerly considered ''Nolina texana''). Similar grasses occur that are native to the eastern half of the city, but often of a higher density owing to increased precipitation. The foothills of Albuquerque are much less urbanized, the vegetation altered or removed than anywhere else in the city, though the lower areas have been mostly developed in a more dense suburban pattern in mostly developed communities including North Albuquerque Acres, Tanoan, High Desert, Glenwood Hills, Embudo Hills, Supper Rock, and Four Hills.\n\n===Native and other fauna===\nAn iconic bird often seen in Albuquerque is the [[greater roadrunner]]. Other birds include the common raven, American crow, great-tailed grackle, Gambel's and scaled quail, several species of hummingbirds, house finch, pigeon, mourning dove, [[White-winged dove|white wing]] and [[Eurasian collared dove|European collared doves]] (both recent appearances), curve-billed thrasher, pinyon jay, and Cooper's, Swainson's, and red-tail hawks. The valley hosts [[sandhill crane]]s each winter.\n\nWithin city limits, the [[southwestern fence lizard]] and [[Aspidoscelis|whiptails]] are common. Snakes include the [[Common garter snake|New Mexico garter snake]] and the [[bullsnake]] in the [[Bosque|Rio Grande Bosque]], and at the edges of the city, the venomous [[Western diamondback rattlesnake]]. [[Woodhouse's toad|Woodhouse toads]] and non-native [[American bullfrog|bullfrogs]] are common around the Rio Grande. Retention ponds within the city often serve as breeding pools for [[New Mexico spadefoot toad]]s and [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]] (\"Triops\").\n\nCommonly seen mammals include the [[coyote]], [[rock squirrel]], [[Gunnison's prairie dog]], [[desert cottontail]], and [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]. Striped skunks, raccoons, and several mouse species can be found in the city, and mule deer and [[Pack rat|woodrats]] occur in the foothills. The broader area is home to bobcat, black bear, and mountain lion, and is at the north end of the range of the [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[Collared peccary|javelina]].\n\nLarger arthropods include the [[Neotibicen dealbatus|plains cicada]], [[Mastigoproctus giganteus|vinegaroon]], [[Scolopendra polymorpha|desert centipede]], [[Hyles lineata|white-lined sphynx]] (hummingbird moth), [[Papilio multicaudata|two-tailed swallowtail]], [[Figeater beetle|fig beetle]], [[Stagmomantis limbata|New Mexico mantis]], and [[Pogonomyrmex|harvester ant]].\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}\n\n====Quadrants====\nAlbuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses. They are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city), and the east-west dividing line is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] tracks.\n\n=====Northeast=====\n\nThis quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the University of New Mexico, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and Winrock Town Center), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, [[Cliff's Amusement Park]], and Balloon Fiesta Park are all in this quadrant.\n\nSome of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].\n\n=====Northwest=====\n[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]\n\nThis quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] (\"woodlands\"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].\n\nThis quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the \"[[West Mesa]]\" or \"Westside\", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].\n\n=====Southeast=====\n[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]\n\nKirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all in the Southeast quadrant.\n\nThe upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.\n\n=====Southwest=====\nTraditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called \"The South Valley\". Although the South Valley is not within Albuquerque's city limits, the quadrant extends through it all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque (\"woodlands\"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.\n\nA new adopted development plan, the Santolina Master Plan, will extend development on the west side past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]] and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear whether the Santolina development will be annexed by the City of Albuquerque or incorporated as its own city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|title=Adopted Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov|access-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907040938/http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|archive-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nAlbuquerque's climate is classified as a dry Warm Temperate climate, as defined by The Biota of North America Program <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124115104/http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |archive-date=November 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the U.S. Geological Survey's Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|title=USGS Scientific Investigations Map 3084: Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States|website=pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901232200/https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|archive-date=September 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> using datasets and mapping technology such as those from the PRISM Climate Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122024305/http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|archive-date=January 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Albuquerque's climate is classified as a [[Cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Albuquerque ([[Albuquerque International Sunport]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Albuquerque kept December 1891 to January 22, 1933 at the Weather Bureau Office and at Albuquerque Int'l since January 23, 1933.

Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|36.4|\u00b0F}} respectively.\n\nAlbuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name=\"noaasun\" /><ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |title        = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate   = October 31, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140723140613/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |archive-date = July 23, 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months.

Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.\n\nThe mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8\u20139&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6\u20138&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10\u201317&nbsp;inches annually.\n\nTraveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment.

Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nOf the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]\u2013[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder.

During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.\n\n===Parks and recreation===\nAccording to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department. The total amount of parkland is 42.9 square miles (111 km2), or about 23% of the city's total area\u2014one of the highest percentages among large cities in the U.S. About 82% of city residents live within walking distance of a park.\n\nAlbuquerque has a botanical and zoological complex called the Albuquerque Biological Park, consisting of the Rio Grande Botanic Garden, Albuquerque Aquarium, Tingley Beach, and the Rio Grande Zoo.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Isotopes Park Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|Isotopes baseball park]]\nThe [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] are a minor league affiliate of the [[Colorado Rockies]], having derived their name from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 12 episode \"[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]\", which involves the [[Springfield Isotopes]] baseball team considering relocating to Albuquerque.<ref>{{cite news| title=Doh!

During his retreat from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops into [[Texas]] he made a stand on April 8, 1862, at Albuquerque and fought the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel [[Edward Canby|Edward R.

In 1902, the famous Alvarado Hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.\n\nNew Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period. Influential [[New Deal]]\u2013era governor [[Clyde Tingley]] and famed Southwestern architect [[John Gaw Meem]] were among those brought to New Mexico by tuberculosis.\n[[File:McCanna-Hubbell Building, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|The [[McCanna\u2013Hubbell Building]], built in 1915, is one of downtown Albuquerque's many historic buildings|alt=|left]]\n\nThe first travelers on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] appeared in Albuquerque in 1926, and before long, dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them.

The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades.

The population of the city proper was estimated at 528,497 in 2009, up from 448,607 in the 2000 census.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Erick |last=Siermers |title=Managing Albuquerque's growth |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222005227/http://abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |archivedate=February 22, 2010  }}</ref> During 2005 and 2006, the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events.\n\nThe passage of the Planned Growth Strategy in 2002\u20132004 was the community's strongest effort to create a framework for a more balanced and sustainable approach to urban growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html |title=Planned Growth Strategy |publisher=Cabq.gov |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517213447/http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nUrban sprawl is limited on three sides\u2014by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] to the north, the [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]] and Kirtland Air Force Base to the south, and the Sandia Mountains to the east.

In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of [[Valencia County]], population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] and [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of [[Tijeras, New Mexico|Tijeras]], [[Edgewood, New Mexico|Edgewood]], and [[Moriarty, New Mexico|Moriarty]], while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen. Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The [[Mid Region Council of Governments]] (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations. MRCOG's cornerstone project is currently the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]].

The elevation of the city ranges from <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">4,900&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,490&nbsp;m)</span> [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near the Rio Grande (in the Valley) to over <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">6,700&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,950&nbsp;m)</span> in the foothill areas of [[Sandia Heights, New Mexico|Sandia Heights]] and Glenwood Hills.

The New Mexico portion of the Rio Grande lies within the [[Rio Grande Rift]] Valley, bordered by a system of [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, including those that lifted up the adjacent [[Sandia Mountains|Sandia]] and [[Manzano Mountains]], while lowering the area where the life-sustaining Rio Grande now flows.\n\n===Geology===\nAlbuquerque lies in the [[Albuquerque Basin]], a portion of the [[Rio Grande rift]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/water/projects/Albuquerque_basin.html \n |title=Albuquerque Basin \n |publisher=The New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources \n |accessdate=September 28, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107124156/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/water/projects/Albuquerque_basin.html \n |archivedate=November 7, 2012 \n}}</ref>\nThe [[Sandia Mountains]] are the predominant geographic feature visible in Albuquerque. ''Sand\u00eda'' is Spanish for \"[[watermelon]]\", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', \"the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo.\"<ref name=\"julyan\">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', \"big mountain.\"<ref name=\"julyan\"/>\n\nThe Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.\n\nBelow the foothills, the area usually called the \"Northeast Heights\" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.\n\nThe last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including \"West Bluff\", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as \"blow sand\", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.\n\n===Potential and former native flora===\nFlora or vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of their desert southwestern and interior west setting, within the varied elevations and terrain. The limits are by significant urbanization, including much infill development occurring in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nSandy soils include scrub and mesa vegetation such as sand sagebrush (''Artemisia filifolia''), fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens''). Some similar grass and seasonal wildflower species occur that also occur in areas east of the Rio Grande, but in much lower densities. Sparsely as well, sandy soil grasses occur such as Indian ricegrass (''Oryzopsis hymenoides''), sand dropseed (''Sporobolus cryptandrus''), and mesa dropseed (''Sporobolus flexuosus''). Arroyos contain desert willow (''Chilopsis linearis'') while breaks and the prominent volcanic escarpment include threeleaf sumac with less frequent stands of oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii''). Isolated littleleaf sumac (''Rhus microphylla'') occurs on the hillsides above Taylor Ranch and at the Petroglyph National Monument Visitor's Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|title=2014 BONAP North American Plant Atlas|website=bonap.net|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111013950/http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|archive-date=January 11, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOther areas of Albuquerque have more fine clay and caliche soils, plus more rainfall and slightly cooler temperatures, so natural vegetation is dominated by grassland species such as fluffgrass (''Erioneuron pulchellum''), purple threeawn (''Hilaria mutica'' or ''Pleuraphis mutica''), bush muhly (''Muhlenbergia porteri''), and black grama (''Bouteloua eriopoda''). Some woody plants occur in overall grassy areas, mainly fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens'') and snakeweed (''Gutierrezia microcephala''). Isolated stands of creosote bush (''Larrea tridentata'') were reported by long-time residents on gravelly, desert pavement soils existing above arroyos and warm breaks, prior to urbanization in the Northeast Quadrant of Albuquerque.<ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson and Tom Bosiljevac, 2004 and earlier</ref> Today only remnants of creosote bush scrub remain in similar soils in foothill areas of Kirtland Air Force Base according to \"Biologic Surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories Coyote Canyon Test Complex \u2013 Kirtland Air Force Base Albuquerque, New Mexico (Marron and Associates, Inc., May 1994)\",<ref>{{Cite document|title=Biologic surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories, Coyote Canyon Test Complex, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico|first1=R.

Some botanists and longtime residents <ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson, 2004 and earlier</ref> recall riparian vegetation, including screwbean mesquite or tornillo (''Prosopis pubescens''), Gooding's willow (''Salix goodingii''), and saint sacaton (''Sporobulus wrightii''). The present bosque or gallery forest of Rio Grande cottonwood (''Populus deltoides var. wislizeni'') and coyote willow (''Salix exigua'') is theorized to have been more savannah-like, prior to replanting in the 1930s. Grass and low cactus cover of many areas is typical of a broader region of the intermontane west riparian zones, such as saltgrass (''Distychilis spp.'') and alkali sacaton (''Sporobulus airoides''). Discontinuous, small stands of New Mexico olive (''Forestiera pubescens var. neomexicana''), Arizona walnut (''Juglans major''), and Arizona ash (''Fraxinus velutina'') can be seen near bosque areas and near former river bends in central New Mexico just north and south of the Albuquerque city limits in the Corrales bosque and along former channels of the Rio Grande in Valencia and Socorro counties. The forest now has a large proportion of non-native species including [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]], [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]], [[Tamarix|saltcedar]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]], [[Ailanthus altissima|Ailanthus]], and [[Saccharum ravennae|ravenna grass]]. Some restoration to native species is occurring, similar to the limited species of ''Populus'' and ''Salix'' used in the 1930s.\n\nOne prominent species of native Mountainous trees is the [[pinyon pine|pi\u00f1on pine]]. At the east end of the city, the Sandia foothills receive about 50 percent more precipitation than most of the city, and with granitic, coarse soils, rock outcrops, and boulders dominant, they have a greater and different diversity of flora in the form of savanna and chaparral, dominated by lower and middle zones of New Mexico Mountains vegetation, with a slight orientation at lower elevations. Dominant plants include shrub or desert live oak (''Quercus turbinella''), gray oak (''Quercus grisea''), hairy mountain mahogany (''Cercocarpus breviflorus''), oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), pi\u00f1on (''Pinus edulis''), threeleaf sumac (''Rhus trilobata''), Engelmann prickly pear (''Opuntia engelmannii''), juniper prickly pear (''Opuntia hystricina var. juniperiana''), and beargrass (''Nolina greenei'', formerly considered ''Nolina texana''). Similar grasses occur that are native to the eastern half of the city, but often of a higher density owing to increased precipitation. The foothills of Albuquerque are much less urbanized, the vegetation altered or removed than anywhere else in the city, though the lower areas have been mostly developed in a more dense suburban pattern in mostly developed communities including North Albuquerque Acres, Tanoan, High Desert, Glenwood Hills, Embudo Hills, Supper Rock, and Four Hills.\n\n===Native and other fauna===\nAn iconic bird often seen in Albuquerque is the [[greater roadrunner]]. Other birds include the common raven, American crow, great-tailed grackle, Gambel's and scaled quail, several species of hummingbirds, house finch, pigeon, mourning dove, [[White-winged dove|white wing]] and [[Eurasian collared dove|European collared doves]] (both recent appearances), curve-billed thrasher, pinyon jay, and Cooper's, Swainson's, and red-tail hawks. The valley hosts [[sandhill crane]]s each winter.\n\nWithin city limits, the [[southwestern fence lizard]] and [[Aspidoscelis|whiptails]] are common. Snakes include the [[Common garter snake|New Mexico garter snake]] and the [[bullsnake]] in the [[Bosque|Rio Grande Bosque]], and at the edges of the city, the venomous [[Western diamondback rattlesnake]]. [[Woodhouse's toad|Woodhouse toads]] and non-native [[American bullfrog|bullfrogs]] are common around the Rio Grande. Retention ponds within the city often serve as breeding pools for [[New Mexico spadefoot toad]]s and [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]] (\"Triops\").\n\nCommonly seen mammals include the [[coyote]], [[rock squirrel]], [[Gunnison's prairie dog]], [[desert cottontail]], and [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]. Striped skunks, raccoons, and several mouse species can be found in the city, and mule deer and [[Pack rat|woodrats]] occur in the foothills. The broader area is home to bobcat, black bear, and mountain lion, and is at the north end of the range of the [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[Collared peccary|javelina]].\n\nLarger arthropods include the [[Neotibicen dealbatus|plains cicada]], [[Mastigoproctus giganteus|vinegaroon]], [[Scolopendra polymorpha|desert centipede]], [[Hyles lineata|white-lined sphynx]] (hummingbird moth), [[Papilio multicaudata|two-tailed swallowtail]], [[Figeater beetle|fig beetle]], [[Stagmomantis limbata|New Mexico mantis]], and [[Pogonomyrmex|harvester ant]].\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}\n\n====Quadrants====\nAlbuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses. They are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city), and the east-west dividing line is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] tracks.\n\n=====Northeast=====\n\nThis quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the University of New Mexico, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and Winrock Town Center), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, [[Cliff's Amusement Park]], and Balloon Fiesta Park are all in this quadrant.\n\nSome of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].\n\n=====Northwest=====\n[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]\n\nThis quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] (\"woodlands\"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].\n\nThis quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the \"[[West Mesa]]\" or \"Westside\", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].\n\n=====Southeast=====\n[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]\n\nKirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all in the Southeast quadrant.\n\nThe upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.\n\n=====Southwest=====\nTraditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called \"The South Valley\". Although the South Valley is not within Albuquerque's city limits, the quadrant extends through it all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque (\"woodlands\"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.\n\nA new adopted development plan, the Santolina Master Plan, will extend development on the west side past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]] and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear whether the Santolina development will be annexed by the City of Albuquerque or incorporated as its own city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|title=Adopted Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov|access-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907040938/http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|archive-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nAlbuquerque's climate is classified as a dry Warm Temperate climate, as defined by The Biota of North America Program <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124115104/http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |archive-date=November 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the U.S. Geological Survey's Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|title=USGS Scientific Investigations Map 3084: Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States|website=pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901232200/https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|archive-date=September 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> using datasets and mapping technology such as those from the PRISM Climate Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122024305/http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|archive-date=January 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Albuquerque's climate is classified as a [[Cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Albuquerque ([[Albuquerque International Sunport]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Albuquerque kept December 1891 to January 22, 1933 at the Weather Bureau Office and at Albuquerque Int'l since January 23, 1933.

Though the city lies to the north of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], parts of Albuquerque shares a similar aridity, temperature regime, and natural vegetation to that of the Chihuahuan Desert, namely the upper elevations with desert grassland and sand scrub plant communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|title=NMSU: New Mexico Range Plants|website=aces.nmsu.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503163417/https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|archive-date=May 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The eastern areas of the Greater Albuquerque Area, known as the East Mountain Area, lie the [[Southwestern Tablelands]] and are sometimes considered a southern extension of the central high plains and northeast New Mexico highlands. To the north is the [[Southern Rockies]] ecoregion in the Jemez Mountains.\n\nThe average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation providing an arid climate, and no month's daily temperature averages below freezing. Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|36.4|\u00b0F}} respectively.\n\nAlbuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name=\"noaasun\" /><ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |title        = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate   = October 31, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140723140613/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |archive-date = July 23, 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months. Extended cloudiness lasting longer than two or three days is rare.\n\nWinter typically consists of cool days and cold nights, except following passage of the strongest cold fronts and arctic airmasses when daytime temperatures remain colder than average; overnight temperatures tend to fall below freezing between about 10 pm and 8 am in the city, except during colder airmasses, plus colder spots of the valley and most of the East Mountain areas. December, the coolest month, averages {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F|1}}, although extreme low temperatures bottom out in early January; the median or normal coolest temperature of the year is just above {{convert|10|\u00b0F|0}}, though the average or mean is below {{convert|10|\u00b0F|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215165129/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |archive-date=December 15, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|title=ALBUQUERQUE INTL AP, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527143551/http://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|archive-date=May 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It is typical for daily low temperatures in much of December, January, and February to be below freezing, the long-term average 76 of 90 days falling to or below freezing; four 24 hour days stay below freezing on average, though that often occurs for less hours west of the Rio Grande and in the Heights.<ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\"/>\n\nSpring is windy, sometimes unsettled with rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. March and April tend to experience many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust. In May, the winds tend to subside as a summer-like airmass and temperatures begin to occur with regularity.\n\nSummer is lengthy and very warm to hot, relatively tolerable for most people because of low humidity and air movement.

Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains.

Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.\n\nThe mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8\u20139&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6\u20138&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10\u201317&nbsp;inches annually.\n\nTraveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment. One such area is considered part of Albuquerque Metropolitan Area, commonly called the East Mountain area; it is covered in woodlands of juniper and pi\u00f1on trees, a common trait of southwestern uplands and the southernmost Rocky Mountains.\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{see also|Kirtland Air Force Base#Environmental contamination due to jet fuel spill}}\n\nAlbuquerque's [[drinking water]] comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan-Chama Project]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Your Drinking Water| url=http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| accessdate=August 1, 2013| website=Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805163835/http://abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| archive-date=August 5, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that has been described as an \"underground [[Lake Superior]]\".

Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nOf the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]\u2013[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder.

During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.\n\n===Parks and recreation===\nAccording to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department.

There is one full [[interchange (road)#Complete interchanges|interchange]] where it connects with Interstate 40; The rest of the route connects to other roads with at-grade intersections controlled by [[stoplight]]s. The Interstate 25 underpass has no access to Coors. Parts of the highway have [[sidewalk]]s, [[bike lane]]s, and [[Median strip|median]]s, but most sections have only dirt shoulders and a center turn lane. To the north of Interstate 40, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 448|State Highway 448]], while to the south, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 45|State Highway 45]].\n* [[New Mexico State Road 500|Rio Bravo Boulevard]]: The main river crossing between Westside Albuquerque and the [[Sunport]], Rio Bravo is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that runs from University Boulevard in the east, through the South Valley, to Coors Boulevard in the west where it is contiguous with Dennis Chaves Blvd. It follows [[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]] for its entire route.\n* [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]]: Central is one of the historical routings of [[US Highway 66|Route 66]], it is no longer a main through highway, its usefulness having been supplanted by Interstate 40.<ref name=\"Bryan\" />{{Rp|248}}\n* [[New Mexico State Road 528|Alameda Boulevard]]: The main road between Rio Rancho and North Albuquerque, Alameda Blvd. stretches from Tramway Rd. to Coors.

Tramway Boulevard starts at I-25 near Sandia Pueblo, and heads east as a two-lane road. It turns south near the base of the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]] and becomes an expressway-type divided highway until its terminus near I-40 and Central Avenue by the western entrance to [[Tijeras Canyon]].\n\nThe [[interchange (road)|interchange]] between I-40 and I-25 is known as the \"[[Big I]]\".<ref name=\"Bryan\" />{{Rp|248}} Originally built in 1966, it was rebuilt in 2002.

It was fought near [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]] and [[Kineton]] in southern [[Warwickshire]] on Sunday, 23 October 1642.\n\nAll attempts at constitutional compromise between [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliament]] broke down early in 1642. Both King and Parliament raised large armies to gain their way by force of arms. In October, at his temporary base near [[Shrewsbury]], the King decided to march to [[London]] in order to force a decisive confrontation with Parliament's main army, commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\nLate on 22 October, both armies unexpectedly found the enemy to be close by. The next day, the Royalist army descended from Edge Hill to force battle. After the Parliamentarian artillery opened a cannonade, the Royalists attacked. Both armies consisted mostly of inexperienced and sometimes ill-equipped troops. Many men from both sides fled or fell out to loot enemy baggage, and neither army was able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nAfter the battle, the King resumed his march on London, but was not strong enough to overcome the defending militia before Essex's army could reinforce them. The inconclusive result of the Battle of Edgehill prevented either faction gaining a quick victory in the war, which eventually lasted four years.with Oliver Cromwell the eventual victor\n\n==Background==\nWhen it appeared to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] that no agreement with Parliament over the government of the kingdom was possible, he left [[London]] on 2 March 1642 and headed for the [[north of England]]. Both Parliament and King realised that armed conflict was inevitable, and prepared to raise forces. Parliament enacted a [[Militia Ordinance]], by which it claimed authority over the country's [[Trainband|trained bands]], while from his temporary capital of [[York]], Charles rejected Parliament's [[Nineteen Propositions]] and issued [[Commissions of Array]], directing the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county to raise forces for the King.\n\nThe King then attempted to seize the port of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] where arms and equipment previously collected for the [[Bishops' Wars]] had been gathered. In the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Siege of Hull]], the Parliamentarian garrison defied the King's authority and drove his forces away from the city. In early August the King moved south, to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Leicester]], where he secured the contents of the local armouries. On 22 August, he took a decisive step by raising the royal standard in [[Nottingham]], effectively declaring war on Parliament. The [[English Midlands|Midlands]] were generally Parliamentarian in sympathy, and few people rallied to the King there, so having again secured the arms and equipment of the local trained bands, Charles moved to [[Chester]] and subsequently to [[Shrewsbury]], where large numbers of recruits from [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh border]] were expected to join him. (By this time, there was conflict in almost every part of England, as local commanders attempted to seize the main cities, ports and castles for their respective factions.)\n\nHaving learned of the King's actions in Nottingham, Parliament dispatched its own army northward under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], to confront the King. Essex marched first to [[Northampton]], where he mustered almost 20,000 men. Learning of the King's move westwards, Essex then marched north-westwards towards [[Worcester]]. On 23 September, in the first clash between the main Royalist and Parliamentarian armies, Royalist cavalry under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] routed the cavalry of Essex's vanguard at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]]. Nevertheless, lacking infantry, the Royalists abandoned Worcester.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy early October, the King's army was almost complete at Shrewsbury. He held a [[council of war]], at which two courses of action were considered. The first was to attack Essex's army at Worcester, which had the drawback that the close country around the city would put the superior Royalist cavalry at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=71}} The second course, which was adopted, was to advance towards London. The intention was not to avoid battle with Essex, but to force one at an advantage. In the [[Earl of Clarendon]]'s words: \"''it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way.''\" Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. Essex followed, but neither army had much information on the location of their enemy.\n\n[[File:Charles Landseer - The Eve of the Battle of Edge Hill, 1642 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Interpretation of Charles I holding a [[council of war]] before the Battle of Edgehill, by [[Charles Landseer]] (1845)]]\nBy 22 October, the Royalist army was quartered in the villages around [[Edgcote]], and was threatening the Parliamentarian post at [[Banbury]]. The garrison of Banbury sent messengers pleading for help to the garrison of [[Warwick Castle]]. Essex, who had just reached there, ordered an immediate march to Kineton to bring relief to Banbury, even though his army had straggled and not all his troops were present. That evening, there were clashes between outposts and quartermasters' parties in Kineton and the villages nearby, and the Royalists had their first inkling that Essex's army was close by.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=75}} The King issued orders for his army to muster for battle on top of the [[escarpment]] of Edgehill the following day.\n\nEssex originally intended marching straight to the relief of Banbury, but at about 8 a.m. on 23 October, his outposts reported that the [[Cavaliers]] were massed on Edgehill, {{convert|4.5|mi}} from Kineton. Essex deployed his army about halfway between Kineton and the Royalist army, where [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] formed a natural position.\n\nThe well known \"Soldiers' Prayer\" was given by [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] before the battle, \"O Lord, Thou Knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me\".<ref name=\"OxfordDictQ\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Knowles |editor1-first=Elizabeth |title=Oxford Dictionary of Quotations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199237173 |edition=7th |quote=O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day: if I forget thee, do not thou forget me.}}</ref>\n\n==The opposing forces==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThere were some significant differences between the opposing armies, which were to be important to the course of the battle and its outcome. Although both armies were composed of very raw soldiers, they had several experienced officers who had previously fought in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Several of them had been recruited to lead English forces which were intended to be sent to Ireland following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Both King and Parliament had bid highly for their services.\n\nThe Royalist cavalry was superior to Parliament's cavalry at this stage of the war. [[Oliver Cromwell]], who arrived too late in the day to take part in the battle, later wrote disparagingly to [[John Hampden]], \"''Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their ''[the Royalists]'' troopers are gentlemen's sons, younger sons and persons of quality....''\" Not only were the Parliamentarian cavalry not so naturally accustomed to mounted action, but they were drilled in the Dutch tactic of firing pistols and carbines from the saddle, whereas under Rupert, the Royalist cavalry would charge sword in hand, relying on shock and weight.\n\nThe Parliamentarian foot soldiers, however, were better equipped than their Royalist counterparts. The Royalist pikemen were said to lack armour, and the musketeers lacked swords, making the Royalist infantry more vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. Several hundred of them lacked any sort of weapon apart from clubs or improvised polearms.\n\n==Deployments==\n\n===Royalist Army===\nThe Royalist right wing of cavalry and dragoons was led by Prince Rupert, with Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] in support. The King's own Lifeguard of Horse insisted on joining Rupert's front line, leaving the King with no cavalry reserve under his own command.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=79}}\n\nThe centre consisted of five \"tertias\" of infantry. There was a last-minute change of command when the Colonel General, [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Lord Lindsey]], was overruled when he wished to deploy them in \"Dutch\" formation, simple phalanxes eight ranks deep. Affronted, he resigned his command and took his place at the head of his own regiment of foot. He was replaced by the Lieutenant General, [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Patrick Ruthven]], who drew up the infantry in chequerboard \"Swedish\" formation, which was potentially more effective but also more difficult to control, particularly with inexperienced soldiers.<ref>For the earl of Forth as commander on the day rather than Rupert or the king see Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, ''[[Alexander Leslie]] and the Scottish Generals of the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618\u20131648'' (Pickering & Chatto, London, 2014), pp.120\u2013123</ref> The centre was led in battle by Sergeant Major General [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]].\n\nThe left wing consisted of horse under Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot]], with [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]], the King's secretary of state, in support and Colonel [[Arthur Aston]]'s dragoons on his left flank.\n\n===Parliamentarians===\nThe Parliamentarian left wing consisted of a loosely organised cavalry brigade of twenty unregimented troops under Sir James Ramsay, supported by 600 musketeers and several cannon, deployed behind a hedge.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\nIn the centre, the infantry brigade of Sir [[John Meldrum]] was drawn up on the left of the front line and Colonel Charles Essex's brigade on the right. Sir Thomas Ballard's infantry brigade was deployed behind Meldrum and the cavalry regiments under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]] and Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] behind Charles Essex.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}} The presence of these two regiments was to be important in the coming battle.\n\nA regiment of infantry under Colonel [[William Fairfax (soldier)|William Fairfax]] linked the centre to the right wing. The right wing consisted of cavalry under [[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Lord Feilding]], posted on some rising ground, with two regiments of dragoons in support.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Edgehill map.svg|thumb|right|500px|Interpretation of the Battle of Edgehill within Radway field \u2013 Royalists blue, Parliamentarians red]]\nAs Essex showed no signs of wishing to attack, the Royalists began to descend the slope of Edgehill some time after midday. Even when they had completed this manoeuvre at about two o'clock, the battle did not begin until the sight of the King with his large entourage riding from regiment to regiment to encourage his soldiers, apparently goaded the Parliamentarians into opening fire.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=104}}\n\nThe King's party withdrew out of range and an artillery duel started. The Royalist guns were trash as most of them were deployed some way up the slope, and from this height most of their shot plunged harmlessly into the earth. While the bombardment continued however, the Royalist dragoons advanced on each flank and drove back the Parliamentarian dragoons and musketeers covering their wings of horse.\n\nOn the right flank, Rupert gave the order to attack. As his charge gathered momentum, a troop of Parliamentarian horse under Faithfull Fortescue abruptly defected. The rest of Ramsay's brigade gave an ineffectual volley of pistol fire from the saddle before turning to flee. Rupert's and Byron's troopers rapidly overran the Parliamentarian guns and musketeers on this flank and galloped jubilantly in pursuit of Ramsay's men, to the detriment of the infantry.\n\nWilmot charged about the same time on the other flank. Feilding's outnumbered troops quickly gave way, and Wilmot and Digby also chased them to Kineton where the Royalist horse fell out to loot the Parliamentarian baggage. Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Lord Grandison rallied about 200 men, but when they tried to charge the Parliamentarian rear, they were distracted by fugitives from Charles Essex's routed brigade.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|pages=78\u201379}}\n\nThe Royalist infantry also advanced in the centre under Ruthven. Many of the Parliamentarian foot had already run away as their cavalry disappeared, and others fled as the infantry came to close quarters. The brigades of Sir Thomas Ballard and Sir [[John Meldrum]] nevertheless stood their ground. The Parliamentarian cavalry regiments of Stapleton and Balfour emerged through gaps in the line of Parliamentarian foot soldiers, and charged the Royalist infantry. With no Royalist cavalry to oppose them, they put many units to flight.\n\nThe King had left himself without any proper reserve. As his centre gave way, he ordered one of his officers to conduct his sons [[Charles II of England|Charles]] (the Prince of Wales) and [[James II of England|James]] (the Duke of York) to safety while Ruthven rallied his infantry. Some of Balfour's men charged so far into the Royalist position that they menaced the princes' escort and briefly overran the Royalist artillery before withdrawing.{{sfn|Young|1995|pp=114\u2013115}} In the front ranks, Lord Lindsey was killed, and Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]] died defending the Royal Standard, which was captured by Parliamentarian [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Arthur Young.\n[[File:Prince Rupert at Edgehill.jpg|alt=A drawing of a fight between two groups of cavalry. Prince Rupert is on the left side of the image pointing his sword.|left|thumb|Prince Rupert leads the Royalist cavalry]]\nBy this time, some of the Royalist horse had rallied and were returning from Kineton. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Welch (variously spelled Welch, Welsh, or Walsh)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishcivilwar.org/2017/05/q-british-historical-medals-of-17th.html |title=Q&A: British Historical Medals of the 17th Century (Jerome J.

John Smith and Sir Robert Welch (or Welsh, Walsh). |author=Struan Bates, quoting Jerome J. Platt}}</ref> of Wilmot's Horse recaptured the Royal Standard by a subterfuge as it was being taken to the Parliamentarian rear as a trophy. Welch also captured two Parliamentarian cannon. As the light began to fade, the battle ended with a fire fight from either side of a dividing ditch, before nightfall eventually brought a natural close to hostilities. The Royalists had been forced back to the position they had originally advanced from, but had regrouped.\n\n==Outcome==\nBy the following morning the King and his army returned to the Edgehill escarpment and Essex's army returned to Kineton. It was a bitterly cold night with a hard frost. This was suggested by contemporary reports as the reason many of the wounded survived, since the cold allowed many wounds to congeal, saving the wounded from bleeding to death or succumbing to infection.\n\nThe following day, both armies partially formed up again, but neither was willing to resume the battle. Charles sent a [[herald]] to Essex with a message of pardon if he would agree to the King's terms, but the [[Courier|messenger]] was roughly handled and forced to return without delivering his message. Although Essex had been reinforced by some of his units which had lagged behind on the march, he withdrew during the evening and the majority of his army marched to Warwick Castle, abandoning seven guns on the battlefield.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday 25th, Prince Rupert led a strong detachment of horse and dragoons and launched a surprise attack upon what remained of the Parliamentarian baggage train at Kineton and killed many of the battle's wounded survivors discovered within the village.\n\nEssex's decision to return northwards to Warwick allowed the King to continue southwards in the direction of London. Rupert urged this course, and was prepared to undertake it with his cavalry alone. With Essex's army still intact, the King chose to move more deliberately, with the whole army. After capturing Banbury on 27 October, he advanced via [[Oxford]], [[Battle of Aylesbury|Aylesbury]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Essex meanwhile had moved directly to London. Reinforced by the London Trained Bands and many citizen volunteers, his army proved to be too strong for the King to contemplate another battle when the Royalists advanced to [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]]. The King withdrew to Oxford, which he made his capital for the rest of the war. With both sides almost evenly matched, it would drag on ruinously for years.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the Royalist cavalry's lack of discipline prevented a clear Royalist victory at Edgehill. Not for the last time in the war, they would gallop after fleeing enemy and then break ranks to plunder, rather than rally to attack the enemy infantry. Byron's and Digby's men in particular, were not involved in the first clashes and should have been kept in hand rather than allowed to gallop off the battlefield. Patrick Ruthven was elevated to the rank of Lord General of the King's Army, confirming his role as acting commander in the battle.<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, p.122</ref>\n\nOn the Parliamentarian side, Sir James Ramsay who had commanded the left wing horse which had been routed during the battle, was tried by court-martial at St. Albans on 5 November. The court reported that he had done all that it became a gallant man to do.\n\nThe last survivor of the battle, [[William Hiseland]], fought also at [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] sixty-seven years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Winder|2006}}; {{harvnb|The Scotsman staff|2006}}</ref>\n\n==The Welch medal==\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Welch, who had recaptured the royal standard, was knighted [[knight banneret|banneret]] on the field by King Charles I next morning. The King also granted a patent for a gold medal to be made (the first to be awarded to an individual for action on a battlefield) commemorating the event in Welch's honour. Captain [[John Smith (banneret)|John Smith]] also claimed a supporting part in the rescue of the royal standard and was accordingly also knighted banneret, but the medal was minted in Sir Robert Welch's name and honour.<ref>The British Library, London.

Civil War}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Edgehill''' (or '''Edge Hill''') was a [[pitched battle]] of the [[First English Civil War]]. It was fought near [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]] and [[Kineton]] in southern [[Warwickshire]] on Sunday, 23 October 1642.\n\nAll attempts at constitutional compromise between [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliament]] broke down early in 1642. Both King and Parliament raised large armies to gain their way by force of arms. In October, at his temporary base near [[Shrewsbury]], the King decided to march to [[London]] in order to force a decisive confrontation with Parliament's main army, commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\nLate on 22 October, both armies unexpectedly found the enemy to be close by. The next day, the Royalist army descended from Edge Hill to force battle. After the Parliamentarian artillery opened a cannonade, the Royalists attacked. Both armies consisted mostly of inexperienced and sometimes ill-equipped troops. Many men from both sides fled or fell out to loot enemy baggage, and neither army was able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nAfter the battle, the King resumed his march on London, but was not strong enough to overcome the defending militia before Essex's army could reinforce them. The inconclusive result of the Battle of Edgehill prevented either faction gaining a quick victory in the war, which eventually lasted four years.\n\n==Background==\nWhen it appeared to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] that no agreement with Parliament over the government of the kingdom was possible, he left [[London]] on 2 March 1642 and headed for the [[north of England]]. Both Parliament and King realised that armed conflict was inevitable, and prepared to raise forces. Parliament enacted a [[Militia Ordinance]], by which it claimed authority over the country's [[Trainband|trained bands]], while from his temporary capital of [[York]], Charles rejected Parliament's [[Nineteen Propositions]] and issued [[Commissions of Array]], directing the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county to raise forces for the King.\n\nThe King then attempted to seize the port of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] where arms and equipment previously collected for the [[Bishops' Wars]] had been gathered. In the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Siege of Hull]], the Parliamentarian garrison defied the King's authority and drove his forces away from the city. In early August the King moved south, to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Leicester]], where he secured the contents of the local armouries. On 22 August, he took a decisive step by raising the royal standard in [[Nottingham]], effectively declaring war on Parliament. The [[English Midlands|Midlands]] were generally Parliamentarian in sympathy, and few people rallied to the King there, so having again secured the arms and equipment of the local trained bands, Charles moved to [[Chester]] and subsequently to [[Shrewsbury]], where large numbers of recruits from [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh border]] were expected to join him. (By this time, there was conflict in almost every part of England, as local commanders attempted to seize the main cities, ports and castles for their respective factions.)\n\nHaving learned of the King's actions in Nottingham, Parliament dispatched its own army northward under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], to confront the King. Essex marched first to [[Northampton]], where he mustered almost 20,000 men. Learning of the King's move westwards, Essex then marched north-westwards towards [[Worcester]]. On 23 September, in the first clash between the main Royalist and Parliamentarian armies, Royalist cavalry under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] routed the cavalry of Essex's vanguard at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]]. Nevertheless, lacking infantry, the Royalists abandoned Worcester.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy early October, the King's army was almost complete at Shrewsbury. He held a [[council of war]], at which two courses of action were considered. The first was to attack Essex's army at Worcester, which had the drawback that the close country around the city would put the superior Royalist cavalry at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=71}} The second course, which was adopted, was to advance towards London. The intention was not to avoid battle with Essex, but to force one at an advantage. In the [[Earl of Clarendon]]'s words: \"''it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way.''\" Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. Essex followed, but neither army had much information on the location of their enemy.\n\n[[File:Charles Landseer - The Eve of the Battle of Edge Hill, 1642 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Interpretation of Charles I holding a [[council of war]] before the Battle of Edgehill, by [[Charles Landseer]] (1845)]]\nBy 22 October, the Royalist army was quartered in the villages around [[Edgcote]], and was threatening the Parliamentarian post at [[Banbury]]. The garrison of Banbury sent messengers pleading for help to the garrison of [[Warwick Castle]]. Essex, who had just reached there, ordered an immediate march to Kineton to bring relief to Banbury, even though his army had straggled and not all his troops were present. That evening, there were clashes between outposts and quartermasters' parties in Kineton and the villages nearby, and the Royalists had their first inkling that Essex's army was close by.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=75}} The King issued orders for his army to muster for battle on top of the [[escarpment]] of Edgehill the following day.\n\nEssex originally intended marching straight to the relief of Banbury, but at about 8 a.m. on 23 October, his outposts reported that the [[Cavaliers]] were massed on Edgehill, {{convert|4.5|mi}} from Kineton. Essex deployed his army about halfway between Kineton and the Royalist army, where [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] formed a natural position.\n\nThe well known \"Soldiers' Prayer\" was given by [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] before the battle, \"O Lord, Thou Knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me\".<ref name=\"OxfordDictQ\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Knowles |editor1-first=Elizabeth |title=Oxford Dictionary of Quotations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199237173 |edition=7th |quote=O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day: if I forget thee, do not thou forget me.}}</ref>\n\n==The opposing forces==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThere were some significant differences between the opposing armies, which were to be important to the course of the battle and its outcome. Although both armies were composed of very raw soldiers, they had several experienced officers who had previously fought in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Several of them had been recruited to lead English forces which were intended to be sent to Ireland following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Both King and Parliament had bid highly for their services.\n\nThe Royalist cavalry was superior to Parliament's cavalry at this stage of the war. [[Oliver Cromwell]], who arrived too late in the day to take part in the battle, later wrote disparagingly to [[John Hampden]], \"''Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their ''[the Royalists]'' troopers are gentlemen's sons, younger sons and persons of quality....''\" Not only were the Parliamentarian cavalry not so naturally accustomed to mounted action, but they were drilled in the Dutch tactic of firing pistols and carbines from the saddle, whereas under Rupert, the Royalist cavalry would charge sword in hand, relying on shock and weight.\n\nThe Parliamentarian foot soldiers, however, were better equipped than their Royalist counterparts. The Royalist pikemen were said to lack armour, and the musketeers lacked swords, making the Royalist infantry more vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. Several hundred of them lacked any sort of weapon apart from clubs or improvised polearms.\n\n==Deployments==\n\n===Royalist Army===\nThe Royalist right wing of cavalry and dragoons was led by Prince Rupert, with Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] in support. The King's own Lifeguard of Horse insisted on joining Rupert's front line, leaving the King with no cavalry reserve under his own command.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=79}}\n\nThe centre consisted of five \"tertias\" of infantry. There was a last-minute change of command when the Colonel General, [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Lord Lindsey]], was overruled when he wished to deploy them in \"Dutch\" formation, simple phalanxes eight ranks deep. Affronted, he resigned his command and took his place at the head of his own regiment of foot. He was replaced by the Lieutenant General, [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Patrick Ruthven]], who drew up the infantry in chequerboard \"Swedish\" formation, which was potentially more effective but also more difficult to control, particularly with inexperienced soldiers.<ref>For the earl of Forth as commander on the day rather than Rupert or the king see Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, ''[[Alexander Leslie]] and the Scottish Generals of the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618\u20131648'' (Pickering & Chatto, London, 2014), pp.120\u2013123</ref> The centre was led in battle by Sergeant Major General [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]].\n\nThe left wing consisted of horse under Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot]], with [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]], the King's secretary of state, in support and Colonel [[Arthur Aston]]'s dragoons on his left flank.\n\n===Parliamentarians===\nThe Parliamentarian left wing consisted of a loosely organised cavalry brigade of twenty unregimented troops under Sir James Ramsay, supported by 600 musketeers and several cannon, deployed behind a hedge.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\nIn the centre, the infantry brigade of Sir [[John Meldrum]] was drawn up on the left of the front line and Colonel Charles Essex's brigade on the right. Sir Thomas Ballard's infantry brigade was deployed behind Meldrum and the cavalry regiments under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]] and Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] behind Charles Essex.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}} The presence of these two regiments was to be important in the coming battle.\n\nA regiment of infantry under Colonel [[William Fairfax (soldier)|William Fairfax]] linked the centre to the right wing. The right wing consisted of cavalry under [[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Lord Feilding]], posted on some rising ground, with two regiments of dragoons in support.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Edgehill map.svg|thumb|right|500px|Interpretation of the Battle of Edgehill within Radway field \u2013 Royalists blue, Parliamentarians red]]\nAs Essex showed no signs of wishing to attack, the Royalists began to descend the slope of Edgehill some time after midday. Even when they had completed this manoeuvre at about two o'clock, the battle did not begin until the sight of the King with his large entourage riding from regiment to regiment to encourage his soldiers, apparently goaded the Parliamentarians into opening fire.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=104}}\n\nThe King's party withdrew out of range and an artillery duel started. The Royalist guns were trash as most of them were deployed some way up the slope, and from this height most of their shot plunged harmlessly into the earth. While the bombardment continued however, the Royalist dragoons advanced on each flank and drove back the Parliamentarian dragoons and musketeers covering their wings of horse.\n\nOn the right flank, Rupert gave the order to attack. As his charge gathered momentum, a troop of Parliamentarian horse under Faithfull Fortescue abruptly defected. The rest of Ramsay's brigade gave an ineffectual volley of pistol fire from the saddle before turning to flee. Rupert's and Byron's troopers rapidly overran the Parliamentarian guns and musketeers on this flank and galloped jubilantly in pursuit of Ramsay's men, to the detriment of the infantry.\n\nWilmot charged about the same time on the other flank. Feilding's outnumbered troops quickly gave way, and Wilmot and Digby also chased them to Kineton where the Royalist horse fell out to loot the Parliamentarian baggage. Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Lord Grandison rallied about 200 men, but when they tried to charge the Parliamentarian rear, they were distracted by fugitives from Charles Essex's routed brigade.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|pages=78\u201379}}\n\nThe Royalist infantry also advanced in the centre under Ruthven. Many of the Parliamentarian foot had already run away as their cavalry disappeared, and others fled as the infantry came to close quarters. The brigades of Sir Thomas Ballard and Sir [[John Meldrum]] nevertheless stood their ground. The Parliamentarian cavalry regiments of Stapleton and Balfour emerged through gaps in the line of Parliamentarian foot soldiers, and charged the Royalist infantry. With no Royalist cavalry to oppose them, they put many units to flight.\n\nThe King had left himself without any proper reserve. As his centre gave way, he ordered one of his officers to conduct his sons [[Charles II of England|Charles]] (the Prince of Wales) and [[James II of England|James]] (the Duke of York) to safety while Ruthven rallied his infantry. Some of Balfour's men charged so far into the Royalist position that they menaced the princes' escort and briefly overran the Royalist artillery before withdrawing.{{sfn|Young|1995|pp=114\u2013115}} In the front ranks, Lord Lindsey was killed, and Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]] died defending the Royal Standard, which was captured by Parliamentarian [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Arthur Young.\n[[File:Prince Rupert at Edgehill.jpg|alt=A drawing of a fight between two groups of cavalry. Prince Rupert is on the left side of the image pointing his sword.|left|thumb|Prince Rupert leads the Royalist cavalry]]\nBy this time, some of the Royalist horse had rallied and were returning from Kineton. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Welch (variously spelled Welch, Welsh, or Walsh)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishcivilwar.org/2017/05/q-british-historical-medals-of-17th.html |title=Q&A: British Historical Medals of the 17th Century (Jerome J.

John Smith and Sir Robert Welch (or Welsh, Walsh). |author=Struan Bates, quoting Jerome J. Platt}}</ref> of Wilmot's Horse recaptured the Royal Standard by a subterfuge as it was being taken to the Parliamentarian rear as a trophy. Welch also captured two Parliamentarian cannon. As the light began to fade, the battle ended with a fire fight from either side of a dividing ditch, before nightfall eventually brought a natural close to hostilities. The Royalists had been forced back to the position they had originally advanced from, but had regrouped.\n\n==Outcome==\nBy the following morning the King and his army returned to the Edgehill escarpment and Essex's army returned to Kineton. It was a bitterly cold night with a hard frost. This was suggested by contemporary reports as the reason many of the wounded survived, since the cold allowed many wounds to congeal, saving the wounded from bleeding to death or succumbing to infection.\n\nThe following day, both armies partially formed up again, but neither was willing to resume the battle. Charles sent a [[herald]] to Essex with a message of pardon if he would agree to the King's terms, but the [[Courier|messenger]] was roughly handled and forced to return without delivering his message. Although Essex had been reinforced by some of his units which had lagged behind on the march, he withdrew during the evening and the majority of his army marched to Warwick Castle, abandoning seven guns on the battlefield.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday 25th, Prince Rupert led a strong detachment of horse and dragoons and launched a surprise attack upon what remained of the Parliamentarian baggage train at Kineton and killed many of the battle's wounded survivors discovered within the village.\n\nEssex's decision to return northwards to Warwick allowed the King to continue southwards in the direction of London. Rupert urged this course, and was prepared to undertake it with his cavalry alone. With Essex's army still intact, the King chose to move more deliberately, with the whole army. After capturing Banbury on 27 October, he advanced via [[Oxford]], [[Battle of Aylesbury|Aylesbury]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Essex meanwhile had moved directly to London. Reinforced by the London Trained Bands and many citizen volunteers, his army proved to be too strong for the King to contemplate another battle when the Royalists advanced to [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]]. The King withdrew to Oxford, which he made his capital for the rest of the war. With both sides almost evenly matched, it would drag on ruinously for years.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the Royalist cavalry's lack of discipline prevented a clear Royalist victory at Edgehill. Not for the last time in the war, they would gallop after fleeing enemy and then break ranks to plunder, rather than rally to attack the enemy infantry. Byron's and Digby's men in particular, were not involved in the first clashes and should have been kept in hand rather than allowed to gallop off the battlefield. Patrick Ruthven was elevated to the rank of Lord General of the King's Army, confirming his role as acting commander in the battle.<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, p.122</ref>\n\nOn the Parliamentarian side, Sir James Ramsay who had commanded the left wing horse which had been routed during the battle, was tried by court-martial at St. Albans on 5 November. The court reported that he had done all that it became a gallant man to do.\n\nThe last survivor of the battle, [[William Hiseland]], fought also at [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] sixty-seven years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Winder|2006}}; {{harvnb|The Scotsman staff|2006}}</ref>\n\n==The Welch medal==\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Welch, who had recaptured the royal standard, was knighted [[knight banneret|banneret]] on the field by King Charles I next morning. The King also granted a patent for a gold medal to be made (the first to be awarded to an individual for action on a battlefield) commemorating the event in Welch's honour. Captain [[John Smith (banneret)|John Smith]] also claimed a supporting part in the rescue of the royal standard and was accordingly also knighted banneret, but the medal was minted in Sir Robert Welch's name and honour.<ref>The British Library, London.

Accompanied by one or two of his comrades similarly attired, he slipped in amongst the ranks of the enemy.... Protected by his scarf, Smith succeeded in escaping hostile notice, and triumphantly laid the recovered standard at the feet of the King.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.\u201d (John 1:25,26).'''\n\n\u201cWhoever hears my words and believes in Him who sent me has eternal life. He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory?

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.\u201d (John 1:25,26).'''\n\n\u201cWhoever hears my words and believes in Him who sent me has eternal life. He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God\u201d Job 34:21-22''\n\n''\u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come close to God, and He will come near you.\u201d James 4:7-8''\n\n''\u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

HCL Notes (and since HCL Domino 9, the Notes Browser Plugin) may be used to access any HCL Domino application, such as discussion forums, document libraries, and numerous other applications. IBM Notes resembles a web-browser in that it may run any compatible application that the user has permission for.\n\nHCL Notes  provides applications that can be used to:\n* access, store and present information through a user interface\n* enforce security\n* replicate, that is, allow many different servers to contain the same information and have many users work with that data\n\nThe standard storage mechanism in HCL Domino is a [[NoSQL]] [[document database|document-database]] format, the \"Notes Storage Facility\" (.nsf). The .nsf file will normally contain both an application design and its associated data. IBM Notes can also access [[relational database]]s, either through an additional server called HCL Enterprise Integrator for Domino, through ODBC calls or through the use of XPages.\n\nAs HCL Notes and Domino is an [[application runtime environment]], email and calendars operate as applications within HCL Notes, which HCL provides with the product.

Notes can access both local- and server-based applications and data.\n\nHCL Notes can function as an [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] email client with non-Domino mail servers. The system can retrieve recipient addresses from any [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] server, including [[Active Directory]], and includes a web browser, although it can be configured by a Domino Developer to launch a different web browser instead.\n\nFeatures include group calendars and schedules, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]/[[MIME]]-based email, [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]-based news support, and automatic HTML conversion of all documents by the Domino [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] task.\n\nHCL Notes can be used with HCL Sametime instant-messaging to allow to see other users online and [[instant messaging|chat]] with one or more of them at the same time. Beginning with Release 6.5, this function has been freely available. [[presence information|Presence]] awareness is available in email and other IBM Domino applications for users in organizations that use both HCL Notes and IBM Sametime.\n\nSince version 7, Notes has provided a [[Web service]]s interface. Domino can be a [[Web server]] for [[HTML]] files; authentication of access to Domino databases or HTML files uses the HCL Domino user directory and external systems such as Microsoft Active Directory.\n\nA design client, HCL Domino Designer, can allow the development of [[database]] applications consisting of forms (which allow users to create documents) and views (which display selected document [[field (computer science)|fields]] in columns).\n\nIn addition to its role as a [[groupware]] system (email, calendaring, shared documents and discussions), HCL Notes and Domino can also construct \"workflow\"-type applications, particularly those which require approval processes and routing of data.\n\nSince Release 5, server clustering has had the ability to provide geographic redundancy for servers.\n\nNotes System Diagnostic (NSD) gathers information about the running of a Notes workstation or of a Domino server.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Speed\n| first1                = Tim\n| title                 = Upgrading to Lotus Notes and Domino 7\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=4J4IPaxR7n0C\n| series                = From technologies to solutions\n| publisher             = Packt Publishing Ltd\n| publication-date      = 2006\n| isbn                  = 9781847190499\n| accessdate            = 2014-04-21\n| quote                 = Notes System Diagnostic (NSD) is a Lotus tool designed to gather information about a Notes workstation or a Domino server.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn October 10, 2018, IBM released IBM Domino v10.0 and IBM Notes 10.0 as the latest release. In December, 2019, HCL released HCL Domino v11 and HCL Notes v11. \n\n==Overview==\n\n===Client/server===\nHCL Notes and Domino is a [[NoSQL]] client/server database environment. The server software is called HCL Domino and the client software is HCL Notes. HCL Domino software can run on Windows, Unix, Linux, [[AIX]], and HCL mid-range systems and can scale to tens of thousands of users per server. There are different supported versions of the HCL Domino server that are supported on the various levels of server operating systems. Usually the latest server operating system is only officially supported by a version of HCL Domino that is released at about the same time as that OS.\n\nHCL Domino has security capabilities on a variety of levels. The authorizations can be granular, down to the field level in specific records all the way up to 10 different parameters that can be set up at a database level, with intermediate options in between. Users can also assign access for other users to their personal calendar and email on a more generic reader, editor, edit with delete and manage my calendar levels. All of the security in HCL Notes and Domino is independent of the server OS or Active Directory. Optionally, the HCL Notes client can be configured to have the user use their Active Directory identity.\n\n===Data replication===\nThe first release of IBM Notes included a generalized replication facility. The generalized nature of this feature set it apart from predecessors like [[Usenet]] and continued to differentiate IBM Notes.\n\nIBM Domino servers and Notes clients identify NSF files by their Replica IDs, and keep replicate files synchronized by bi-directionally exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design. There are options available to define what meta-data replicate, or specifically exclude certain meta data from replicating. Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-[[Real-time operating system|real-time]] when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.\n\nCreation of a local replica of an NSF file on the hard disk of an IBM Notes client enables the user to fully use IBM Notes and Domino databases while working off-line. The client synchronizes any changes when client and server next connect. Local replicas are also sometimes maintained for use while connected to the network in order to reduce network [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Replication between an IBM Notes client and Domino server can run automatically according to a schedule, or manually in response to a user or programmatic request. Since Notes 6, local replicas maintain all security features programmed into the applications. Earlier releases of Notes did not always do so. Early releases also did not offer a way to [[encryption|encrypt]] NSF files, raising concerns that local replicas might expose too much confidential data on [[laptop]]s or insecure [[home office]] computers, but more recent releases offer encryption, and as of {{when|date=July 2015}} the default setting for newly created local replicas.\n\n===Security===\nIBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client\u2013server and server\u2013server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a \"workload reduction factor\" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.<ref>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.52.html#subj1 \"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!\"] ''The Risks Digest'', Volume 19, Issue 52, 1997-12-24</ref><ref>[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html Only NSA can listen, so that's OK] Heise, 1999.</ref> This implementation was widely announced, but with some justification many people did consider it to be a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. Some governments objected to being put at a disadvantage to the NSA, and as a result Lotus continued to support the 40-bit version for export to those countries.\n\nUnder current US export laws, IBM Notes supports only one version of the Notes PKI with 128-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit public keys, and no workload reduction factor. The Domino server includes security tools support [[S/MIME]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] 3.0 with industry standard key sizes for HTTP and other [[Internet Protocol|Internet protocols]], [[X.509]] client certificates, and an integrated [[certificate authority]].\n\nIBM Notes and Domino also uses a code-signature framework that controls the security context, runtime, and rights of custom code developed and introduced into the environment. Notes 5 introduced an execution control list (ECL) at the client level. The ECL allows or denies the execution of custom code based on the signature attached to it, preventing code from untrusted (and possibly malignant) sources from running. Notes and Domino 6 allowed client ECLs to be managed centrally by server administrators through the implementation of policies. Since release 4.5, the code signatures listed in properly configured ECLs prevent code from being executed by external sources, to avoid [[computer virus|virus]] propagation through Notes/Domino environments. Administrators can centrally control whether each mailbox user can add exceptions to, and thus override, the ECL.\n\n===Database security===\nAccess control lists (ACLs) control a user of server's level of access to that database. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database.\n\nRoles, rather than user id, can determine access level.\n\n===Programming===\nIBM Notes and Domino is a cross-platform, distributed document-oriented [[NoSQL]] database and messaging framework and rapid application development environment that includes pre-built applications like email, calendar, etc. This sets it apart from its major commercial competitors, such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[Novell GroupWise]], which are purpose-built applications for mail and calendaring that offer APIs for extensibility.\n\nIBM Domino databases are built using the IBM Domino Designer client, available only for [[Microsoft Windows]]; standard user clients are available for Windows, [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].<ref>Domino Designer clients available here http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/lsndad/</ref> A key feature of IBM Notes is that many replicas of the same database can exist at the same time on different servers and clients, across dissimilar platforms; the same storage architecture is used for both client and server replicas. Originally, replication in Notes happened at document (i.e., record) level. With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level.\n\nA database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a \"note\". Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items.\n\nThere are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Lotus Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code.\n\nDocument notes can have parent-child relationships, but IBM Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of [[information management system]]s. Notes databases are also not [[Relational model|relational]], although there is a [[SQL]] driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features. IBM Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its [[file locking]] is rudimentary. IBM Notes is a [[document-oriented database]] (document-based, schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that IBM Notes is typically used to automate.\n\nItems represent the content of a note. Every item has a name, a type, and may have some flags set. A note can have more than one item with the same name. Item types include Number, Number List, Text, Text List, Date-Time, Date-Time List, and Rich Text. Flags are used for managing attributes associated with the item, such as read or write security. Items in design notes represent the programmed elements of a database. For example, the layout of an entry form is stored in the rich text Body item within a form design note. This means that the design of the database can replicate to users' desktops just like the data itself, making it extremely easy to deploy updated applications.\n\nItems in document notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named \"Form\" in a document note can be used to bind a document to a form design note, which directs the IBM Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given form design note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods can be used to override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of IBM Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.\n\nIBM Notes applications development uses several programming languages. [[Formula language|Formula]] and LotusScript are the two original ones. LotusScript is similar to, and may even be considered a specialized implementation of, Visual Basic, but with the addition of many native classes that model the IBM Notes environment, whereas Formula is similar to [[Lotus 1-2-3]] formula language but is unique to Notes.\n\nJava was integrated into IBM Notes beginning with Release 4.5. With Release 5, Java support was greatly enhanced and expanded, and [[JavaScript]] was added. While LotusScript remains a primary tool in developing applications for the Lotus Notes client, Java and JavaScript are the primary tools for server-based processing, developing applications for browser access, and allowing browsers to emulate the functionality of the IBM Notes client. With XPages, the IBM Notes client can now natively process Java and JavaScript code, although applications development usually requires at least some code specific to only IBM Notes or only a browser.\n\nAs of version 6, Lotus established an [[XML]] programming interface in addition to the options already available. The Domino XML Language (DXL) provides XML representations of all data and design resources in the Notes model, allowing any XML processing tool to create and modify IBM Notes and Domino data.\n\nSince Release 8.5, XPages were also integrated into IBM Notes.\n\nExternal to the IBM Notes application, IBM provides toolkits in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to connect to the IBM Domino database and perform a wide variety of tasks. The C toolkit is the most mature, and the C++ toolkit is an objectized version of the C toolkit, lacking many functions the C toolkit provides. The Java toolkit is the least mature of the three and can be used for basic application needs.\n\n===Database===\nIBM Notes includes a [[database management system]] but IBM Notes files are different from relational or object databases because they are document-centric. [[Document-oriented database]]s such as IBM Notes allow multiple values in items (fields), do not require a [[database schema|schema]], come with built-in document-level access control, and store rich text data. IBM Domino 7 to 8.5.x supports the use of [[IBM DB2]] database as an alternative store for IBM Notes databases. This NSFDB2 feature, however, is now in maintenance mode with no further development planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21384421|title=IBM Support statement for Lotus Domino NSFDB2 - United States\n|date=January 10, 2017 |website=www-01.ibm.com |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> An IBM Notes database can be mapped to a relational database using tools like DECS, [LEI], JDBCSql for Domino or NotesSQL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |title=NotesSQL |publisher=IBM |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602090000/http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that IBM Notes and Domino is a multi-value database system like [[Pick operating system|PICK]], or that it is an object system like [[Zope]], but it is in fact unique. Whereas the temptation for relational database programmers is to [[database normalization|normalize]] databases, Notes databases must be [[denormalization|denormalized]]. RDBMS developers often find it difficult to conceptualize the difference. It may be useful to think of an IBM Notes document (a 'note') as analogous to an XML document natively stored in a database (although with limitations on the data types and structures available).\n\nSince Lotus Notes 8.5, IBM started to change the term Database to Application, because of the reason that these files are not really object databases as mentioned above.\n\nThe benefits of this data structure are:\n# No need to define size of fields, or datatype;\n# Attributes (Notes fields) that are null take up no space in a database;\n# Built-in full text searching.\n\n===Configuration===\nThe IBM Domino server or the IBM Notes client store their configuration in their own databases / application files (*.nsf). No relevant configuration settings are saved in the Windows Registry if the operating system is Windows. Some other configuration options (primary the start configuration) is stored in the notes.ini (there are currently over 2000 known options available<ref>notes.ini Reference - by alphabet http://www.lntoolbox.com/en/notesini-reference.html</ref>).\n\n==Use as an email client==\nIBM Notes is commonly deployed as an end-user email client in larger organizations, with IBM claiming a cumulative 145 million {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} licenses sold to date.\n\nWhen an organization employs an IBM Domino server, it usually also deploys the supplied IBM Notes client for accessing the IBM Notes application for email and calendaring but also to use document management and workflow applications. As IBM Notes is a runtime environment, and the email and calendaring functions in IBM Notes are simply an application provided by IBM, the administrators are free to develop alternate email and calendaring applications. It is also possible to alter, amend or extend the IBM supplied email and calendaring application.\n\nThe IBM Domino server also supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] mail clients, and through an extension product (IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook) supports native access for Microsoft Outlook clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=877&letternum=ENUSZP16-0324 |title=IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook, V2.0 expands mail client options for IBM Notes and IBM Domino |publisher=IBM \n|date=June 28, 2016  |accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIBM also provides IBM iNotes (in Notes 6.5 renamed to \"Domino Web Access\" but in version 8.0 reverted to iNotes), to allow the use of email and calendaring features through web browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux, such as [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]]. There are several spam filtering programs available (including IBM Lotus Protector), and a rules engine allowing user-defined mail processing to be performed by the server.\n\n===Comparison with other email clients===\nIBM Notes was designed as a collaborative application platform where email was just one of numerous applications that ran in the Notes client software. The Notes client was also designed to run on multiple platforms including [[Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[classic Mac OS]], SCO Open Desktop UNIX, and Linux. These two factors have resulted in the user interface containing some differences from applications that only run on Windows. Furthermore, these differences have often remained in the product to retain backward compatibility with earlier releases, instead of conforming to updated Windows UI standards. The following are some of these differences.\n* Properties dialog boxes for formatting text, hyperlinks and other rich-text information can remain open after a user makes changes to selected text. This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the dialog box, selecting new text and opening a new format dialog box. Almost all other Windows applications require the user to close the dialog box, select new text, then open a new dialog box for formatting/changes.\n* Properties dialog boxes also automatically recognize the type of text selected and display appropriate selections (for instance, a hyperlink properties box).\n* Users can format tables as tabbed interfaces as part of form design (for applications) or within mail messages (or in rich-text fields in applications). This provides users the ability to provide tab-style organization to documents, similar to popular tab navigation in most web portals, etc.\n* End-users can readily insert links to IBM Notes applications, IBM Notes views or other IBM Notes documents into IBM Notes documents.\n* Deleting a document (or email) will delete it from every folder in which it appears, since the folders simply contain links to the same back-end document. Some other email clients only delete the email from the current folder; if the email appears in other folders it is left alone, requiring the user to hunt through multiple folders in order to completely delete a message. In IBM Notes, clicking on \"Remove from Folder\" will remove the document only from that folder leaving all other instances intact.\n* The ''All Documents'' and ''Sent'' \"views\" differ from other collections of documents known as \"folders\" and exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, mail cannot be dragged out of them, and so removed from those views; the email can only be \"copied\" from them. This is because these are ''views'', and their membership indexes are maintained according to characteristics of the documents contained in them, rather than based on user interaction as is the case for a ''folder''. This technical difference can be baffling to users, in environments where no training is given. ''All Documents'' contain all of the documents in a mailbox, no matter which folder it is in. The only way to remove something from ''All Documents'' is to delete it outright.\n\nLotus Notes 7 and older versions had more differences, which were removed from subsequent releases:\n* Users select a \"New Memo\" to send an email, rather than \"New Mail\" or \"New Message\". (Notes 8 calls the command \"New Message\")\n* To select multiple documents in a Notes view, one drags one's mouse next to the documents to select, rather than using {{keypress|\u21e7 Shift}}+single click. (Notes 8 uses keypress conventions.)\n* The searching function offers a \"phrase search\", rather than the more common \"or search\", and Notes requires users to spell out boolean conditions in search-strings. As a result, users must search for \"delete AND folder\" in order to find help text that contains the phrase \"delete a folder\". Searching for \"delete folder\" does not yield the desired result. (Notes 8 uses or-search conventions.)\n\nLotus Notes 8.0 (released in 2007) became the first version to employ a dedicated user-experience team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/marybeth/entry/welcome_to_my_design_blog |title=Welcome to my \"design blog\"! |author=Mary Raven |publisher=IBM |date=April 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> resulting in changes in the IBM Notes client experience in the primary and new notes user interface. This new interface runs in the open source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Framework, which is a project started by IBM, opening up more application development opportunities through the use of Eclipse plug-ins. The new interface provides many new user interface features and the ability to include user-selected applications/applets in small panes in the interface. Lotus Notes 8.0 also included a new email interface / design to match the new Lotus Notes 8.0 eclipse based interface. Eclipse is a Java framework and allows IBM to port Notes to other platforms rapidly. An issue with Eclipse and therefore Notes 8.0 is the applications start-up and user-interaction speed. Lotus Notes 8.5 sped up the application and the increase in general specification of PCs means this is less of an issue.\n\nIBM Notes 9 continued the evolution of the user interface to more closely align with modern application interfaces found in many commercial packaged or web-based software. Currently, the software still does not have an auto-correct option - or even ability - to reverse accidental use of caps lock.\n\nDomino is now running on the Eclipse platform and offers many new development environments and tools such as XPages.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.lifeit.co.uk/infrastructure/domino/training/\n| title = Lotus Notes & Domino Training - Life IT\n| website = www.lifeit.co.uk\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nFor lower spec PCs, a new version of the old interface is still provided albeit as it is the old interface many of the new features are not available and the email user interface reverts to the Notes 7.x style.\n\nThis new user experience builds on Notes 6.5 (released in 2003), which upgraded the email client, previously regarded by many as the product's [[Achilles heel]]. Features added at that time included:\n* drag and drop of folders\n* replication of unread marks between servers\n* follow-up flags\n* reply and forward indicators on emails\n* ability to edit an attachment and save the changes back to an email id\n\n==Reception==\n{{Criticism section|date=June 2014}}\n\nPublications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 have criticized earlier versions of Lotus Notes for having an \"unintuitive [user] interface\" and cite widespread dissatisfaction with the [[usability]] of the client software. ''The Guardian'' indicated that Notes has not necessarily suffered as a result of this dissatisfaction due to the fact that \"the people who choose [enterprise software] tend not to be the ones who use it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1705106,00.html\n | title = Survival of the unfittest\n |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 2006-02-09\n| first=Charles\n| last=Arthur\n}}</ref>\n\nEarlier versions of Lotus Notes have also been criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular [[operating system]] should follow that particular OS's [[user interface]] style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, which is used to refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an idea of how long the document is, relative to the portion being viewed).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |title       = Lotus Notes Sucks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120422075347/http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |archive-date = 2012-04-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/updated-lotus-notes-hannover-screenshots#01252006042825PMPSCUCT.htm\n | title = Updated Lotus Notes \"Hannover\" screenshots (comment)\n}}</ref>\n\nOlder versions of Lotus Notes also suffered from similar user interaction choices, many of which were also corrected in subsequent releases. One example that was corrected in Release 8.5: In earlier versions the out-of-office agent needed to be manually enabled when leaving and disabled when coming back, even if start and end date have been set. As of Release 8.5 the out-of-office notification now automatically shuts off without a need for a manual disable.\n\nUnlike some other e-mail client software programs, IBM Notes developers made a choice to not allow individual users to determine whether a return receipt is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe \"Allowing individual cancellation of return receipt violates the intent of a return receipt function within an organization\". So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in return receipts going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server's .INI file can now contain an entry to control return receipt in a manner that's more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21241003\n | title = Is there a setting in Lotus Notes to control whether a return receipt is sent?\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/tip/Finding-and-disabling-hidden-return-receipts\n | title = Finding and disabling return receipts\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mindwatering.net/SupportRef.nsf/b49d69a888845c8085256d220011d77b/37fdcce19aa1551685256929001226d1!OpenDocument\n | title = Techniques to Not Send a Return Receipt When Viewing Mail\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen IBM Notes crashes, some processes may continue running and prevent the application from being restarted until they are killed.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualobjectives.com.au/notesdomino/killnotes.htm| title = KillNotes}}</ref>\n\n==Related software==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Related IBM Lotus products===\nOver the 30-year history of IBM Notes, Lotus Development Corporation and later IBM have developed many other software products that are based on or integrated with IBM Notes. The most prominent of these is the [[IBM Lotus Domino]] server software, which was originally known as the Lotus Notes Server and gained a separate name with the release of version 4.5. The server platform also became the foundation for products such as [[IBM Lotus Quickr|IBM Lotus Quickr for Domino]], for document management, and [[IBM Lotus Sametime|IBM Sametime]] for instant messaging, audio and video communication, and web conferencing, and with Release 8.5, [[IBM Connections]].\n\nIn early releases of IBM Notes, there was considerable emphasis on client-side integration with the [[IBM Lotus SmartSuite]] environment. With Microsoft's increasing predominance in office productivity software, the desktop integration focus switched for a time to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of version 8.0 in 2007, based on the Eclipse framework, IBM again added integration with its own office-productivity suite, the [[OpenOffice.org]]-derived [[IBM Lotus Symphony]]. [[IBM Lotus Expeditor]] is a framework for developing Eclipse-based applications.\n\nOther IBM products and technologies have also been built to integrate with IBM Notes. For mobile-device synchronization, this previously included the client-side [[IBM Lotus Easysync Pro]] product (no longer in development) and [[IBM Lotus Notes Traveler|IBM Notes Traveler]], a newer no-charge server-side add-on for mail, calendar and contact sync. A recent addition to IBM's portfolio are two [[IBM Lotus Protector]] products for mail security and encryption, which have been built to integrate with IBM Notes.\n\n===Related software from other vendors===\nWith a long market history and large installed base, IBM Notes and Domino have spawned a large third-party software ecosystem. Such products can be divided into four broad, and somewhat overlapping classes:\n\n* IBM Notes and Domino applications are software programs written in the form of one or more IBM Notes databases, and often supplied as NTF templates. This type of software typically is focused on providing business benefit from IBM Notes' core collaboration, workflow and messaging capabilities. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM), human resources, and project tracking systems. Some applications of this sort may offer a browser interface in addition to Notes client access. The code within these programs typically uses the same languages available to an in-house IBM Domino developer: IBM Notes formula language, [[LotusScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]].\n* IBM Notes and Domino add-ons, tools and extensions are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language that are designed specifically to integrate with IBM Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, IBM Notes databases may be used for configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core IBM Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products, server administration and monitoring tools, messaging and storage management products, policy-based tools, data synchronization tools and developer tools.\n* IBM Notes and Domino-aware adds-ins and agents are also executable programs, but they are designed to extend the reach of a general networked software product to IBM Notes and IBM Domino data. This class includes server and client backup software, anti-spam and anti-virus products, and e-discovery and archiving systems. It also includes add-ins to integrate IBM Notes with third-party offerings such as Cisco [[WebEx]] conferencing service or the [[Salesforce.com]] CRM platform.\n\n==History==\nIBM Notes has a history spanning more than 30 years.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory Official history of Lotus Notes] IBM DeveloperWorks Web Site</ref> Its chief inspiration was ''PLATO Notes'', created by David R. Woolley at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1973. In today's terminology, PLATO Notes was a message board, and it was part of the foundation for an online community which thrived for more than 20 years on the [[PLATO system]].<ref>[https://archives.library.illinois.edu/e-records/index.php?dir=University%20Archives/0713010/ PLATO Notes Files, 1972-1976 (Record Series 7/13/10)], from the [https://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=5145 University of Illinois Archives]; this includes several years worth of transcripts of old notes files from the mid 1970s, recovered from very low quality printouts.</ref> [[Ray Ozzie]] worked with PLATO while attending the University of Illinois in the 1970s. When PC network technology began to emerge, Ozzie made a deal with [[Mitch Kapor]], the founder of [[Lotus Development Corporation]], that resulted in the formation of [[Iris Associates]] in 1984 to develop products that would combine the capabilities of PCs with the collaborative tools pioneered in PLATO. The agreement put control of product development under Ozzie and Iris, and sales and marketing under Lotus. In 1994, after the release and marketplace success of Notes R3, Lotus purchased Iris. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus.\n\nIn 2008, IBM released [[XPages]] technology, based on [[JavaServer Faces]]. This allows IBM Domino applications to be better surfaced to browser clients, though the UX and business logic must be completely rewritten. Previously, IBM Domino applications could be accessed through browsers, but required extensive web specific modifications to get full functionality in browsers. XPages also give the application new capabilities that are not possible with the classic IBM Notes client. The IBM Domino 9 Social Edition included the IBM Notes Browser Plugin, which would surface Notes applications through a minified version of the rich desktop client contained in a browser tab.\n\n===Branding===\nPrior to release 4.5, the ''Lotus Notes'' branding encompassed both the client and server applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory/ |title=The History of Notes and Domino |publisher=IBM \n|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, Lotus released an [[HTTP]] server add-on for the Notes 4 server called \"Domino\". This add-on allowed Notes documents to be rendered as web pages in real time. Later that year, the Domino web server was integrated into release 4.5 of the core Notes server and the entire server program was re-branded, taking on the name \"[[IBM Lotus Domino|Domino]]\". Only the client program officially retained the \"Lotus Notes\" name.\n\nIn November 2012, IBM announced it would  be dropping the Lotus brand and moving forward with the IBM brand only to identify products, including Notes and Domino.<ref>[http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ibm-drops-lotus-brand-takes-notes-and-domino-forward/ \"IBM Drops Lotus Brand, Takes Notes and Domino Forward\"] Article published in November, 2012</ref> On October 9, 2018, IBM announced the availability of the latest version of the client and server software.\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The .nsf file will normally contain both an application design and its associated data. IBM Notes can also access [[relational database]]s, either through an additional server called HCL Enterprise Integrator for Domino, through ODBC calls or through the use of XPages.\n\nAs HCL Notes and Domino is an [[application runtime environment]], email and calendars operate as applications within HCL Notes, which HCL provides with the product. A Domino application-developer can change or completely replace that application.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.peoplecube.com/products-rs-lotus-notes-faq.htm/ \n|title=Third party alters and extends the email and calendaring application supplied by IBM for Lotus Notes |publisher=Peoplecube.com |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}\n</ref>  HCL has released the base templates as open source as well.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ddrschiw/ad113 |title=Lotusphere 2010 presentation: AD113 - IBM Lotus Notes Discussion Template: Next Generation and Other OpenNTF Assets |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=June 18, 2009\n |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nProgrammers can develop applications for HCL Notes in a variety of development languages including:\n* the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] either directly or through XPages\n* [[LotusScript]], a language resembling [[Visual Basic]]\n* the [[JavaScript (programming language)|JavaScript programming language]] via the Domino AppDev Pack\n\nThe client supports a formula language as well as JavaScript. Software developers can build applications to run either within the HCL Notes application runtime environment or through a web server for use in a web browser, although the interface would need to be developed separately unless XPages is used.\n\n==Use==\nHCL Notes can be used for email, as a calendar, [[Personal information management|PIM]], instant messaging, [[Web browsing]], and other applications. Notes can access both local- and server-based applications and data.\n\nHCL Notes can function as an [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] email client with non-Domino mail servers. The system can retrieve recipient addresses from any [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] server, including [[Active Directory]], and includes a web browser, although it can be configured by a Domino Developer to launch a different web browser instead.\n\nFeatures include group calendars and schedules, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]/[[MIME]]-based email, [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]-based news support, and automatic HTML conversion of all documents by the Domino [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] task.\n\nHCL Notes can be used with HCL Sametime instant-messaging to allow to see other users online and [[instant messaging|chat]] with one or more of them at the same time. Beginning with Release 6.5, this function has been freely available. [[presence information|Presence]] awareness is available in email and other IBM Domino applications for users in organizations that use both HCL Notes and IBM Sametime.\n\nSince version 7, Notes has provided a [[Web service]]s interface. Domino can be a [[Web server]] for [[HTML]] files; authentication of access to Domino databases or HTML files uses the HCL Domino user directory and external systems such as Microsoft Active Directory.\n\nA design client, HCL Domino Designer, can allow the development of [[database]] applications consisting of forms (which allow users to create documents) and views (which display selected document [[field (computer science)|fields]] in columns).\n\nIn addition to its role as a [[groupware]] system (email, calendaring, shared documents and discussions), HCL Notes and Domino can also construct \"workflow\"-type applications, particularly those which require approval processes and routing of data.\n\nSince Release 5, server clustering has had the ability to provide geographic redundancy for servers.\n\nNotes System Diagnostic (NSD) gathers information about the running of a Notes workstation or of a Domino server.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Speed\n| first1                = Tim\n| title                 = Upgrading to Lotus Notes and Domino 7\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=4J4IPaxR7n0C\n| series                = From technologies to solutions\n| publisher             = Packt Publishing Ltd\n| publication-date      = 2006\n| isbn                  = 9781847190499\n| accessdate            = 2014-04-21\n| quote                 = Notes System Diagnostic (NSD) is a Lotus tool designed to gather information about a Notes workstation or a Domino server.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn October 10, 2018, IBM released IBM Domino v10.0 and IBM Notes 10.0 as the latest release. In December, 2019, HCL released HCL Domino v11 and HCL Notes v11. \n\n==Overview==\n\n===Client/server===\nHCL Notes and Domino is a [[NoSQL]] client/server database environment. The server software is called HCL Domino and the client software is HCL Notes. HCL Domino software can run on Windows, Unix, Linux, [[AIX]], and HCL mid-range systems and can scale to tens of thousands of users per server. There are different supported versions of the HCL Domino server that are supported on the various levels of server operating systems. Usually the latest server operating system is only officially supported by a version of HCL Domino that is released at about the same time as that OS.\n\nHCL Domino has security capabilities on a variety of levels. The authorizations can be granular, down to the field level in specific records all the way up to 10 different parameters that can be set up at a database level, with intermediate options in between. Users can also assign access for other users to their personal calendar and email on a more generic reader, editor, edit with delete and manage my calendar levels. All of the security in HCL Notes and Domino is independent of the server OS or Active Directory. Optionally, the HCL Notes client can be configured to have the user use their Active Directory identity.\n\n===Data replication===\nThe first release of IBM Notes included a generalized replication facility. The generalized nature of this feature set it apart from predecessors like [[Usenet]] and continued to differentiate IBM Notes.\n\nIBM Domino servers and Notes clients identify NSF files by their Replica IDs, and keep replicate files synchronized by bi-directionally exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design. There are options available to define what meta-data replicate, or specifically exclude certain meta data from replicating. Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-[[Real-time operating system|real-time]] when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.\n\nCreation of a local replica of an NSF file on the hard disk of an IBM Notes client enables the user to fully use IBM Notes and Domino databases while working off-line. The client synchronizes any changes when client and server next connect. Local replicas are also sometimes maintained for use while connected to the network in order to reduce network [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Replication between an IBM Notes client and Domino server can run automatically according to a schedule, or manually in response to a user or programmatic request. Since Notes 6, local replicas maintain all security features programmed into the applications. Earlier releases of Notes did not always do so. Early releases also did not offer a way to [[encryption|encrypt]] NSF files, raising concerns that local replicas might expose too much confidential data on [[laptop]]s or insecure [[home office]] computers, but more recent releases offer encryption, and as of {{when|date=July 2015}} the default setting for newly created local replicas.\n\n===Security===\nIBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client\u2013server and server\u2013server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a \"workload reduction factor\" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.<ref>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.52.html#subj1 \"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!\"] ''The Risks Digest'', Volume 19, Issue 52, 1997-12-24</ref><ref>[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html Only NSA can listen, so that's OK] Heise, 1999.</ref> This implementation was widely announced, but with some justification many people did consider it to be a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. Some governments objected to being put at a disadvantage to the NSA, and as a result Lotus continued to support the 40-bit version for export to those countries.\n\nUnder current US export laws, IBM Notes supports only one version of the Notes PKI with 128-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit public keys, and no workload reduction factor. The Domino server includes security tools support [[S/MIME]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] 3.0 with industry standard key sizes for HTTP and other [[Internet Protocol|Internet protocols]], [[X.509]] client certificates, and an integrated [[certificate authority]].\n\nIBM Notes and Domino also uses a code-signature framework that controls the security context, runtime, and rights of custom code developed and introduced into the environment. Notes 5 introduced an execution control list (ECL) at the client level. The ECL allows or denies the execution of custom code based on the signature attached to it, preventing code from untrusted (and possibly malignant) sources from running. Notes and Domino 6 allowed client ECLs to be managed centrally by server administrators through the implementation of policies. Since release 4.5, the code signatures listed in properly configured ECLs prevent code from being executed by external sources, to avoid [[computer virus|virus]] propagation through Notes/Domino environments. Administrators can centrally control whether each mailbox user can add exceptions to, and thus override, the ECL.\n\n===Database security===\nAccess control lists (ACLs) control a user of server's level of access to that database. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database.\n\nRoles, rather than user id, can determine access level.\n\n===Programming===\nIBM Notes and Domino is a cross-platform, distributed document-oriented [[NoSQL]] database and messaging framework and rapid application development environment that includes pre-built applications like email, calendar, etc. This sets it apart from its major commercial competitors, such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[Novell GroupWise]], which are purpose-built applications for mail and calendaring that offer APIs for extensibility.\n\nIBM Domino databases are built using the IBM Domino Designer client, available only for [[Microsoft Windows]]; standard user clients are available for Windows, [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].<ref>Domino Designer clients available here http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/lsndad/</ref> A key feature of IBM Notes is that many replicas of the same database can exist at the same time on different servers and clients, across dissimilar platforms; the same storage architecture is used for both client and server replicas. Originally, replication in Notes happened at document (i.e., record) level. With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level.\n\nA database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a \"note\". Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items.\n\nThere are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Lotus Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code.\n\nDocument notes can have parent-child relationships, but IBM Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of [[information management system]]s. Notes databases are also not [[Relational model|relational]], although there is a [[SQL]] driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features. IBM Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its [[file locking]] is rudimentary. IBM Notes is a [[document-oriented database]] (document-based, schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that IBM Notes is typically used to automate.\n\nItems represent the content of a note. Every item has a name, a type, and may have some flags set. A note can have more than one item with the same name. Item types include Number, Number List, Text, Text List, Date-Time, Date-Time List, and Rich Text. Flags are used for managing attributes associated with the item, such as read or write security. Items in design notes represent the programmed elements of a database. For example, the layout of an entry form is stored in the rich text Body item within a form design note. This means that the design of the database can replicate to users' desktops just like the data itself, making it extremely easy to deploy updated applications.\n\nItems in document notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named \"Form\" in a document note can be used to bind a document to a form design note, which directs the IBM Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given form design note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods can be used to override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of IBM Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.\n\nIBM Notes applications development uses several programming languages. [[Formula language|Formula]] and LotusScript are the two original ones. LotusScript is similar to, and may even be considered a specialized implementation of, Visual Basic, but with the addition of many native classes that model the IBM Notes environment, whereas Formula is similar to [[Lotus 1-2-3]] formula language but is unique to Notes.\n\nJava was integrated into IBM Notes beginning with Release 4.5. With Release 5, Java support was greatly enhanced and expanded, and [[JavaScript]] was added. While LotusScript remains a primary tool in developing applications for the Lotus Notes client, Java and JavaScript are the primary tools for server-based processing, developing applications for browser access, and allowing browsers to emulate the functionality of the IBM Notes client. With XPages, the IBM Notes client can now natively process Java and JavaScript code, although applications development usually requires at least some code specific to only IBM Notes or only a browser.\n\nAs of version 6, Lotus established an [[XML]] programming interface in addition to the options already available. The Domino XML Language (DXL) provides XML representations of all data and design resources in the Notes model, allowing any XML processing tool to create and modify IBM Notes and Domino data.\n\nSince Release 8.5, XPages were also integrated into IBM Notes.\n\nExternal to the IBM Notes application, IBM provides toolkits in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to connect to the IBM Domino database and perform a wide variety of tasks. The C toolkit is the most mature, and the C++ toolkit is an objectized version of the C toolkit, lacking many functions the C toolkit provides. The Java toolkit is the least mature of the three and can be used for basic application needs.\n\n===Database===\nIBM Notes includes a [[database management system]] but IBM Notes files are different from relational or object databases because they are document-centric. [[Document-oriented database]]s such as IBM Notes allow multiple values in items (fields), do not require a [[database schema|schema]], come with built-in document-level access control, and store rich text data. IBM Domino 7 to 8.5.x supports the use of [[IBM DB2]] database as an alternative store for IBM Notes databases. This NSFDB2 feature, however, is now in maintenance mode with no further development planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21384421|title=IBM Support statement for Lotus Domino NSFDB2 - United States\n|date=January 10, 2017 |website=www-01.ibm.com |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> An IBM Notes database can be mapped to a relational database using tools like DECS, [LEI], JDBCSql for Domino or NotesSQL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |title=NotesSQL |publisher=IBM |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602090000/http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that IBM Notes and Domino is a multi-value database system like [[Pick operating system|PICK]], or that it is an object system like [[Zope]], but it is in fact unique. Whereas the temptation for relational database programmers is to [[database normalization|normalize]] databases, Notes databases must be [[denormalization|denormalized]]. RDBMS developers often find it difficult to conceptualize the difference. It may be useful to think of an IBM Notes document (a 'note') as analogous to an XML document natively stored in a database (although with limitations on the data types and structures available).\n\nSince Lotus Notes 8.5, IBM started to change the term Database to Application, because of the reason that these files are not really object databases as mentioned above.\n\nThe benefits of this data structure are:\n# No need to define size of fields, or datatype;\n# Attributes (Notes fields) that are null take up no space in a database;\n# Built-in full text searching.\n\n===Configuration===\nThe IBM Domino server or the IBM Notes client store their configuration in their own databases / application files (*.nsf). No relevant configuration settings are saved in the Windows Registry if the operating system is Windows. Some other configuration options (primary the start configuration) is stored in the notes.ini (there are currently over 2000 known options available<ref>notes.ini Reference - by alphabet http://www.lntoolbox.com/en/notesini-reference.html</ref>).\n\n==Use as an email client==\nIBM Notes is commonly deployed as an end-user email client in larger organizations, with IBM claiming a cumulative 145 million {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} licenses sold to date.\n\nWhen an organization employs an IBM Domino server, it usually also deploys the supplied IBM Notes client for accessing the IBM Notes application for email and calendaring but also to use document management and workflow applications. As IBM Notes is a runtime environment, and the email and calendaring functions in IBM Notes are simply an application provided by IBM, the administrators are free to develop alternate email and calendaring applications. It is also possible to alter, amend or extend the IBM supplied email and calendaring application.\n\nThe IBM Domino server also supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] mail clients, and through an extension product (IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook) supports native access for Microsoft Outlook clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=877&letternum=ENUSZP16-0324 |title=IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook, V2.0 expands mail client options for IBM Notes and IBM Domino |publisher=IBM \n|date=June 28, 2016  |accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIBM also provides IBM iNotes (in Notes 6.5 renamed to \"Domino Web Access\" but in version 8.0 reverted to iNotes), to allow the use of email and calendaring features through web browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux, such as [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]]. There are several spam filtering programs available (including IBM Lotus Protector), and a rules engine allowing user-defined mail processing to be performed by the server.\n\n===Comparison with other email clients===\nIBM Notes was designed as a collaborative application platform where email was just one of numerous applications that ran in the Notes client software. The Notes client was also designed to run on multiple platforms including [[Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[classic Mac OS]], SCO Open Desktop UNIX, and Linux. These two factors have resulted in the user interface containing some differences from applications that only run on Windows. Furthermore, these differences have often remained in the product to retain backward compatibility with earlier releases, instead of conforming to updated Windows UI standards. The following are some of these differences.\n* Properties dialog boxes for formatting text, hyperlinks and other rich-text information can remain open after a user makes changes to selected text. This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the dialog box, selecting new text and opening a new format dialog box. Almost all other Windows applications require the user to close the dialog box, select new text, then open a new dialog box for formatting/changes.\n* Properties dialog boxes also automatically recognize the type of text selected and display appropriate selections (for instance, a hyperlink properties box).\n* Users can format tables as tabbed interfaces as part of form design (for applications) or within mail messages (or in rich-text fields in applications). This provides users the ability to provide tab-style organization to documents, similar to popular tab navigation in most web portals, etc.\n* End-users can readily insert links to IBM Notes applications, IBM Notes views or other IBM Notes documents into IBM Notes documents.\n* Deleting a document (or email) will delete it from every folder in which it appears, since the folders simply contain links to the same back-end document. Some other email clients only delete the email from the current folder; if the email appears in other folders it is left alone, requiring the user to hunt through multiple folders in order to completely delete a message. In IBM Notes, clicking on \"Remove from Folder\" will remove the document only from that folder leaving all other instances intact.\n* The ''All Documents'' and ''Sent'' \"views\" differ from other collections of documents known as \"folders\" and exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, mail cannot be dragged out of them, and so removed from those views; the email can only be \"copied\" from them. This is because these are ''views'', and their membership indexes are maintained according to characteristics of the documents contained in them, rather than based on user interaction as is the case for a ''folder''. This technical difference can be baffling to users, in environments where no training is given. ''All Documents'' contain all of the documents in a mailbox, no matter which folder it is in. The only way to remove something from ''All Documents'' is to delete it outright.\n\nLotus Notes 7 and older versions had more differences, which were removed from subsequent releases:\n* Users select a \"New Memo\" to send an email, rather than \"New Mail\" or \"New Message\". (Notes 8 calls the command \"New Message\")\n* To select multiple documents in a Notes view, one drags one's mouse next to the documents to select, rather than using {{keypress|\u21e7 Shift}}+single click. (Notes 8 uses keypress conventions.)\n* The searching function offers a \"phrase search\", rather than the more common \"or search\", and Notes requires users to spell out boolean conditions in search-strings. As a result, users must search for \"delete AND folder\" in order to find help text that contains the phrase \"delete a folder\". Searching for \"delete folder\" does not yield the desired result. (Notes 8 uses or-search conventions.)\n\nLotus Notes 8.0 (released in 2007) became the first version to employ a dedicated user-experience team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/marybeth/entry/welcome_to_my_design_blog |title=Welcome to my \"design blog\"! |author=Mary Raven |publisher=IBM |date=April 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> resulting in changes in the IBM Notes client experience in the primary and new notes user interface. This new interface runs in the open source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Framework, which is a project started by IBM, opening up more application development opportunities through the use of Eclipse plug-ins. The new interface provides many new user interface features and the ability to include user-selected applications/applets in small panes in the interface. Lotus Notes 8.0 also included a new email interface / design to match the new Lotus Notes 8.0 eclipse based interface. Eclipse is a Java framework and allows IBM to port Notes to other platforms rapidly. An issue with Eclipse and therefore Notes 8.0 is the applications start-up and user-interaction speed. Lotus Notes 8.5 sped up the application and the increase in general specification of PCs means this is less of an issue.\n\nIBM Notes 9 continued the evolution of the user interface to more closely align with modern application interfaces found in many commercial packaged or web-based software. Currently, the software still does not have an auto-correct option - or even ability - to reverse accidental use of caps lock.\n\nDomino is now running on the Eclipse platform and offers many new development environments and tools such as XPages.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.lifeit.co.uk/infrastructure/domino/training/\n| title = Lotus Notes & Domino Training - Life IT\n| website = www.lifeit.co.uk\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nFor lower spec PCs, a new version of the old interface is still provided albeit as it is the old interface many of the new features are not available and the email user interface reverts to the Notes 7.x style.\n\nThis new user experience builds on Notes 6.5 (released in 2003), which upgraded the email client, previously regarded by many as the product's [[Achilles heel]]. Features added at that time included:\n* drag and drop of folders\n* replication of unread marks between servers\n* follow-up flags\n* reply and forward indicators on emails\n* ability to edit an attachment and save the changes back to an email id\n\n==Reception==\n{{Criticism section|date=June 2014}}\n\nPublications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 have criticized earlier versions of Lotus Notes for having an \"unintuitive [user] interface\" and cite widespread dissatisfaction with the [[usability]] of the client software. ''The Guardian'' indicated that Notes has not necessarily suffered as a result of this dissatisfaction due to the fact that \"the people who choose [enterprise software] tend not to be the ones who use it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1705106,00.html\n | title = Survival of the unfittest\n |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 2006-02-09\n| first=Charles\n| last=Arthur\n}}</ref>\n\nEarlier versions of Lotus Notes have also been criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular [[operating system]] should follow that particular OS's [[user interface]] style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, which is used to refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an idea of how long the document is, relative to the portion being viewed).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |title       = Lotus Notes Sucks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120422075347/http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |archive-date = 2012-04-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/updated-lotus-notes-hannover-screenshots#01252006042825PMPSCUCT.htm\n | title = Updated Lotus Notes \"Hannover\" screenshots (comment)\n}}</ref>\n\nOlder versions of Lotus Notes also suffered from similar user interaction choices, many of which were also corrected in subsequent releases. One example that was corrected in Release 8.5: In earlier versions the out-of-office agent needed to be manually enabled when leaving and disabled when coming back, even if start and end date have been set. As of Release 8.5 the out-of-office notification now automatically shuts off without a need for a manual disable.\n\nUnlike some other e-mail client software programs, IBM Notes developers made a choice to not allow individual users to determine whether a return receipt is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe \"Allowing individual cancellation of return receipt violates the intent of a return receipt function within an organization\". So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in return receipts going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server's .INI file can now contain an entry to control return receipt in a manner that's more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21241003\n | title = Is there a setting in Lotus Notes to control whether a return receipt is sent?\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/tip/Finding-and-disabling-hidden-return-receipts\n | title = Finding and disabling return receipts\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mindwatering.net/SupportRef.nsf/b49d69a888845c8085256d220011d77b/37fdcce19aa1551685256929001226d1!OpenDocument\n | title = Techniques to Not Send a Return Receipt When Viewing Mail\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen IBM Notes crashes, some processes may continue running and prevent the application from being restarted until they are killed.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualobjectives.com.au/notesdomino/killnotes.htm| title = KillNotes}}</ref>\n\n==Related software==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Related IBM Lotus products===\nOver the 30-year history of IBM Notes, Lotus Development Corporation and later IBM have developed many other software products that are based on or integrated with IBM Notes. The most prominent of these is the [[IBM Lotus Domino]] server software, which was originally known as the Lotus Notes Server and gained a separate name with the release of version 4.5. The server platform also became the foundation for products such as [[IBM Lotus Quickr|IBM Lotus Quickr for Domino]], for document management, and [[IBM Lotus Sametime|IBM Sametime]] for instant messaging, audio and video communication, and web conferencing, and with Release 8.5, [[IBM Connections]].\n\nIn early releases of IBM Notes, there was considerable emphasis on client-side integration with the [[IBM Lotus SmartSuite]] environment. With Microsoft's increasing predominance in office productivity software, the desktop integration focus switched for a time to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of version 8.0 in 2007, based on the Eclipse framework, IBM again added integration with its own office-productivity suite, the [[OpenOffice.org]]-derived [[IBM Lotus Symphony]]. [[IBM Lotus Expeditor]] is a framework for developing Eclipse-based applications.\n\nOther IBM products and technologies have also been built to integrate with IBM Notes. For mobile-device synchronization, this previously included the client-side [[IBM Lotus Easysync Pro]] product (no longer in development) and [[IBM Lotus Notes Traveler|IBM Notes Traveler]], a newer no-charge server-side add-on for mail, calendar and contact sync. A recent addition to IBM's portfolio are two [[IBM Lotus Protector]] products for mail security and encryption, which have been built to integrate with IBM Notes.\n\n===Related software from other vendors===\nWith a long market history and large installed base, IBM Notes and Domino have spawned a large third-party software ecosystem. Such products can be divided into four broad, and somewhat overlapping classes:\n\n* IBM Notes and Domino applications are software programs written in the form of one or more IBM Notes databases, and often supplied as NTF templates. This type of software typically is focused on providing business benefit from IBM Notes' core collaboration, workflow and messaging capabilities. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM), human resources, and project tracking systems. Some applications of this sort may offer a browser interface in addition to Notes client access. The code within these programs typically uses the same languages available to an in-house IBM Domino developer: IBM Notes formula language, [[LotusScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]].\n* IBM Notes and Domino add-ons, tools and extensions are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language that are designed specifically to integrate with IBM Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, IBM Notes databases may be used for configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core IBM Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products, server administration and monitoring tools, messaging and storage management products, policy-based tools, data synchronization tools and developer tools.\n* IBM Notes and Domino-aware adds-ins and agents are also executable programs, but they are designed to extend the reach of a general networked software product to IBM Notes and IBM Domino data. This class includes server and client backup software, anti-spam and anti-virus products, and e-discovery and archiving systems. It also includes add-ins to integrate IBM Notes with third-party offerings such as Cisco [[WebEx]] conferencing service or the [[Salesforce.com]] CRM platform.\n\n==History==\nIBM Notes has a history spanning more than 30 years.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory Official history of Lotus Notes] IBM DeveloperWorks Web Site</ref> Its chief inspiration was ''PLATO Notes'', created by David R. Woolley at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1973. In today's terminology, PLATO Notes was a message board, and it was part of the foundation for an online community which thrived for more than 20 years on the [[PLATO system]].<ref>[https://archives.library.illinois.edu/e-records/index.php?dir=University%20Archives/0713010/ PLATO Notes Files, 1972-1976 (Record Series 7/13/10)], from the [https://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=5145 University of Illinois Archives]; this includes several years worth of transcripts of old notes files from the mid 1970s, recovered from very low quality printouts.</ref> [[Ray Ozzie]] worked with PLATO while attending the University of Illinois in the 1970s. When PC network technology began to emerge, Ozzie made a deal with [[Mitch Kapor]], the founder of [[Lotus Development Corporation]], that resulted in the formation of [[Iris Associates]] in 1984 to develop products that would combine the capabilities of PCs with the collaborative tools pioneered in PLATO. The agreement put control of product development under Ozzie and Iris, and sales and marketing under Lotus. In 1994, after the release and marketplace success of Notes R3, Lotus purchased Iris. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus.\n\nIn 2008, IBM released [[XPages]] technology, based on [[JavaServer Faces]]. This allows IBM Domino applications to be better surfaced to browser clients, though the UX and business logic must be completely rewritten. Previously, IBM Domino applications could be accessed through browsers, but required extensive web specific modifications to get full functionality in browsers. XPages also give the application new capabilities that are not possible with the classic IBM Notes client. The IBM Domino 9 Social Edition included the IBM Notes Browser Plugin, which would surface Notes applications through a minified version of the rich desktop client contained in a browser tab.\n\n===Branding===\nPrior to release 4.5, the ''Lotus Notes'' branding encompassed both the client and server applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory/ |title=The History of Notes and Domino |publisher=IBM \n|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, Lotus released an [[HTTP]] server add-on for the Notes 4 server called \"Domino\". This add-on allowed Notes documents to be rendered as web pages in real time. Later that year, the Domino web server was integrated into release 4.5 of the core Notes server and the entire server program was re-branded, taking on the name \"[[IBM Lotus Domino|Domino]]\". Only the client program officially retained the \"Lotus Notes\" name.\n\nIn November 2012, IBM announced it would  be dropping the Lotus brand and moving forward with the IBM brand only to identify products, including Notes and Domino.<ref>[http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ibm-drops-lotus-brand-takes-notes-and-domino-forward/ \"IBM Drops Lotus Brand, Takes Notes and Domino Forward\"] Article published in November, 2012</ref> On October 9, 2018, IBM announced the availability of the latest version of the client and server software.\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He visited [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] in 1895, returning with reproductions of work by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Frans Hals]]. From 1901, he undertook painting trips to northern France and the [[Hebrides]] with his friend [[J. D. Fergusson]], another of the Scottish Colourists. Inspired by the bright sunlight, he experimented with the bold use of colour, and the influence of the rustic realism of French painters is evident in his [[Landscape art|landscapes]].\n\nIn 1910 Peploe married Margaret MacKay (1873\u20131958), whom he had known since 1894.<ref name=\"port\"/> He also moved to Paris in 1910, a period which saw him concentrate increasingly on still life and landscape painting.

Although his work never became overly [[Abstract art|abstract]], it was notable for its use of strong colour, tight composition, and meticulous execution. Influences are said to include [[Andr\u00e9 Dunoyer de Segonzac|de Segonzac]], [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Matisse]] and [[Van Gogh]].<ref name=\"port\"/> He died in Edinburgh in 1935.

He visited [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] in 1895, returning with reproductions of work by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Frans Hals]]. From 1901, he undertook painting trips to northern France and the [[Hebrides]] with his friend [[J. D. Fergusson]], another of the Scottish Colourists. Inspired by the bright sunlight, he experimented with the bold use of colour, and the influence of the rustic realism of French painters is evident in his [[Landscape art|landscapes]].\n\nIn 1910 Peploe married Margaret MacKay (1873\u20131958), whom he had known since 1894.<ref name=\"port\"/> He also moved to Paris in 1910, a period which saw him concentrate increasingly on still life and landscape painting. His still-life works show the influence of [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]], with combinations of fluid brushwork, thick [[impasto]] and dark backgrounds with strong lighting. Returning to Scotland in 1912 he found that his usual dealer refused his work and he was obliged to stage his own exhibition.<ref name=\"port\">[http://www.portlandgallery.com/pages/artist/30908/biography/s_j_peploe.html Biography and works at Portland Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204001245/http://www.portlandgallery.com/pages/artist/30908/biography/s_j_peploe.html |date=4 February 2013 }}, accessed December 2012</ref> Peploe went on regular painting trips with friends to many parts of the country, and during the 1920s he spent several summers with [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]], another [[Scottish Colourist]], painting in [[Iona]].\n\nPeploe was strongly influenced by French painting throughout his life. Although his work never became overly [[Abstract art|abstract]], it was notable for its use of strong colour, tight composition, and meticulous execution. Influences are said to include [[Andr\u00e9 Dunoyer de Segonzac|de Segonzac]], [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Matisse]] and [[Van Gogh]].<ref name=\"port\"/> He died in Edinburgh in 1935.
