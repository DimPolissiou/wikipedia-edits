Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\".

Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''.

Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day.

Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\". Other singles, \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" and \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.

Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]].

Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made.

The club based in Veseliei Street promoted in the [[Liga III|Divizia C]], for the first time in its history, at the end of the 1994\u201395 season, after crowning as champions of [[Bucharest]].

A year later, the artist returned to the valley for the first [[Gwangju Biennale]] in Korea and scattered various clothes made of traditional Korean fabrics on the ground of a forest. This installation, made of 2.5 tons of second-hand clothes and entitled ''Sewing into Walking- Dedicated to the victims of Kwangju'', commemorated the victims of the suppression of a [[Gwangju Uprising|democratic protest in Gwangju]] in 1980. This work established an analogy between the structure of fabric and that of the land, which was of particular importance in terms of confirming the three-dimensionality and spatial topology of fabric in the artist's work, as well as establishing her body in performance as a needle that weaves through the fabric of humanity and nature.<ref>Brewinska, Maria, from the exhibition catalogue Kimsooja at the Zacheta Gallery of Art, Warsaw, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Cities on the Move: 2727km Bottari Truck and Bottari Truck - Migrateurs ===\nIn ''Cities on the Move \u2013 2727 km Bottari Truck,'' Kimsooja sits atop a mound of ''bottari'' being transported across the country.

Her practice combines performance, film, photo, and site-specific installation using textile, light, and sound. Kimsooja\u2019s work investigates questions concerning the conditions of humanity, while engaging issues of aesthetics, culture, politics, and the environment. Her principle of \u2018non-doing\u2019 and \u2018non-making,\u2019 which follows a conceptual and structural investigation of performance through modes of mobility and immobility, inverts the notion of the artist as the predominant actor. \n\nKimsooja's recent major projects include ''Travers\u00e9es\\Kimsooja,'' Poitiers, France (2019-2020), ''To Breathe,'' Public Commission for the new metro station Mairie de Saint-Ouen in Paris (2020), 21<sup>st</sup> century new stained-glass commission for the Saint-Etienne Cathedral in Metz, France (2020), Asia Society Triennial, New York (2020). Kimsooja has exhibited in major museums and institutions around the world, including [[Peabody Essex Museum]] (2019); [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]] and Chapel (2018-2019); [[Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (2018); [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]] (2017); [[National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art|MMCA]] Korea (2016); [[Centre Pompidou-Metz|Centre Pompidou Metz]] (2015); [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] (2015); [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] (2013); [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne (Saint-\u00c9tienne)|Museum of Modern Art Saint-Etienne]] (2012); [[P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami]] (PAMM) (2012); [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|Baltic Center for Contemporary Art]] Gateshead, UK (2009); [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|BOZAR,]] Brussels (2008); Crystal Palace, [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda|Museum Reina Sofia]], Spain (2006); [[National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens|The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens]] (2005); Kunstmuseum Palast Dusseldorf (2004); [[Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Lyon|Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon]] (2003); PAC Milan (2003); [[Kunsthalle Wien|Kunsthalle Wein]] (2002); [[Kunsthalle Bern]] (2001); [[MoMA PS1]] (2001); [[Plateau (museum)|Rodin Gallery]], Leeum Samsung Museum of Fine Art (2000); ICC Tokyo (2001); and CCA Kitakyushu (1999).\n\nKimsooja represented Korea for the [[55th Venice Biennale]] [[Korean pavilion|Korean Pavilion]] (2013), and for the 24th [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial|S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale]] (1998), participated in [[Documenta 14|Kassel Documenta 14]]: ANTIDORON \u2013 The EMST Collection (2017), and has taken part in international biennials and triennials: Busan (2016, 2002), Venice (2019, 2013, 2007, 2005, 2001, 1999), Gwangju (2012, 2002,1995), Moscow(2009), Istanbul (1997), Lyon(2002), and Manifesta 1 (1996) among others. <ref name=\"biography\" /> \n\n==Name==\nAfter having to pick a domain name for her website, Kimsooja thought about the conceptual implications of combining her name into one word.

A year later, the artist returned to the valley for the first [[Gwangju Biennale]] in Korea and scattered various clothes made of traditional Korean fabrics on the ground of a forest. This installation, made of 2.5 tons of second-hand clothes and entitled ''Sewing into Walking- Dedicated to the victims of Kwangju'', commemorated the victims of the suppression of a [[Gwangju Uprising|democratic protest in Gwangju]] in 1980. This work established an analogy between the structure of fabric and that of the land, which was of particular importance in terms of confirming the three-dimensionality and spatial topology of fabric in the artist's work, as well as establishing her body in performance as a needle that weaves through the fabric of humanity and nature.<ref>Brewinska, Maria, from the exhibition catalogue Kimsooja at the Zacheta Gallery of Art, Warsaw, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Cities on the Move: 2727km Bottari Truck and Bottari Truck - Migrateurs ===\nIn ''Cities on the Move \u2013 2727 km Bottari Truck,'' Kimsooja sits atop a mound of ''bottari'' being transported across the country.

''The Bottari Truck - Migrateurs'' was made of local immigrants\u2019 bedcovers and used clothing donated from all over Paris that was loaded on top of an old French Peugeot pick-up truck. Kim started from \u2018Place de la Liberation\u2019 where Mus\u00e9e [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Contemporain du Val-de-Marne|MAC/VAL]], which commissioned the piece, is located, and at the same time which is just on the border of south east of Paris, where many immigrants from China, the Middle East, Africa and Europe live. She moves on to different neighborhoods of Paris, which signifies the history of immigrants in France: Ivry (large Chinese community), Place d\u2019Italy, Bastille, Place de la Republic, Canal Saint-Martin(which used to have tents along the canal area from homeless people, now much cleaned, making a water tunnel), Gare du Nord, Goutte d\u2019Or (a large African, Middle Eastern, Indian community), to the destination \u2018\u00c9glise Saint-Bernard\u2019, where most of the illegal immigrants settled down and protested their right to live in France in 1996; that has became a big political issue in French society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Korean Cultural Service (New York, N.Y.)
