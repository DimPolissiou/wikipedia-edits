It brought an end to the [[First War of Scottish Independence]], which had begun with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296. The treaty was signed in Edinburgh by [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland, on 17 March 1328, and was [[ratified]] by the [[English Parliament]] at [[Northampton]] on 1 May.\n\nThe terms of the treaty stipulated that, in exchange for \u00a3100,000 [[Pound sterling|sterling]], the English Crown would recognise:\n\n* The Kingdom of Scotland as fully independent;\n* Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as the rightful rulers of Scotland.\n* The border between Scotland and England as that recognised under the reign of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] (1249\u20131286).\n\nOne of two copies of the document, which was written in French, is held by the [[National Archives of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Archives |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ |website=The National Archives |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>. However, this document does not constitute the entire peace treaty, which was contained in a number of indentures, notorial instruments and lettters patents issued by Edward III and Robert I. All of these do not survive, which is why all the details of the peace treaty are not known.\n\n==The War==\n{{main|First War of Scottish Independence}}\nThe cause of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] was ultimately the uncertainty over the succession of the [[Monarchy of Scotland|Scottish crown]] following the death of Alexander III in 1286. [[Edward I of England]] initially supported the claim of [[John Balliol]], who was crowned King of Scots in 1292, but eventually pressed his own claim to sovereignty over Scotland. After Balliol's removal and exile, [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] broke from the English camp and took up his own rival claim to the crown, by leading a resistance to Edward. Robert declared himself King, after killing his chief rival and cousin, and was crowned in 1306. He decisively defeated the English, under [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] in 1314.\n\nPeace talks were held between 1321 and 1324. Little progress was made, as the English refused to recognise Robert the Bruce as King of Scots, although a truce was agreed in 1323, to last thirteen years.<ref name=ScotGov>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/208 |title=Document of the Month - June: The Treaty of Edinburgh, 1328 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> Edward II claimed he adhered to this truce, but he allowed English [[privateer]]s to attack [[Flemish people|Flemish]] vessels trading with [[Scotland]].

In 1327, the Scots invaded northern [[England]] and defeated the English at the [[Battle of Stanhope Park]] in [[Weardale]] in [[County Durham]]. Before this, Bruce invaded [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]].\n\n==Negotiations==\nAfter the debacle of the [[Weardale campaign]], the [[Dowager]] Queen [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Earl Mortimer of March]], governing England on behalf of the underage [[Edward III of England]], began to consider peace as the only remaining option. In October 1327 they sent envoys to Scotland to open negotiations. On 1 March 1328, at a Parliament at [[York]], Edward III issued [[letters patent]] which set out the core of the agreement.  On 17 March, the negotiations ended and a formal treaty was signed in the King's Chamber of the [[Holyrood Abbey|Abbey of Holyrood]], [[Edinburgh]].

In the [[Quitclaim deed|quitclaim]] of Edward III of 1 March 1328 preceding the treaty Edward endorsed that the [[Anglo\u2013Scottish border]] would be maintained as it was in the reign of [[Alexander III of Scotland]] and that Scotland, so defined, \"shall belong to our dearest ally and friend, the magnificent prince, Lord Robert, by God's grace illustrious King of Scotland, and to his heirs and successors, separate in all things from the kingdom of England, whole, free, and undisturbed in perpetuity, without any kind of subjection, service, claim or demand.\"<ref>Ronald McNair Scott: ''Robert the Bruce, King of Scots'', Hutchinson & Co 1982, p 222</ref> In return, the Scots would pay \u00a3100,000 [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to England, which was raised by a special peace [[tax|levy]].<ref name=ScotGov/>\n\nAs part of the treaty negotiations, Edward III agreed to return the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] to Scotland. This was not in the treaty, but was part of a concurrent agreement. Edward III issued a royal writ, 4 months later, on 1 July, addressed to the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbot of Westminster]], which acknowledged this agreement and ordered the Stone be taken to his mother &mdash; it was not. Eventually, 668 years later, it was returned to Scotland, arriving on 30 November 1996 at Edinburgh Castle. When next there is a coronation of a United Kingdom monarch, the stone is to be transported to England for use in the ceremony.\n\n==Effects==\nThe treaty lasted only five years. It was unpopular with many English nobles, who viewed it as humiliating.

Designed for the Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] ({{reign | 1741 | 1762}}) in a dazzling [[Baroque]] style, the palace came to be known as the most imposing private residence of the era of Elizabeth Petrovna. Some{{who?|date=November 2019}} suggest architects [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]] were responsible for the design, though that is yet to be substantiated. The main frontage faces the river and was originally connected to it by a [[canal]].\n\nConstruction works continued for thirteen years; when they finally finished in 1754 the Empress Elizabeth presented the palace to her favourite (and likely spouse), Count [[Aleksey Razumovsky]]. After his death in 1771, the palace reverted to the crown, but [[Catherine II of Russia| Catherine the Great of Russia]] ({{reign | 1762 | 1796}}) donated it to her own favourite, [[Grigory Potyomkin |Prince Potemkin]], in 1776. The architect [[Ivan Starov]] was charged with extensive renovations of the palace in the newly-fashionable [[Neoclassical architecture| Neoclassical style]], which were effected in 1778 and 1779. Simultaneously an English garden architect, William Hould, laid out a regular park. [[File:Anichkov.jpg|thumb|The colonnade of Her Imperial Majesty's Cabinet (designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]])]]\n\nUpon Potemkin's demise (1791), the palace was restored to the crown and adapted to accommodate Her Imperial Majesty's Cabinet.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n\nThe last major structural additions occurred in the reign (1801-1825) of Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia| Alexander I]], with [[Giacomo Quarenghi| Quarenghi]]'s construction of the Imperial Cabinet along Nevsky Avenue. The latter structure was formulated in a rigorous Neoclassical style and many{{quantify|date=November 2019}} people feel that it doesn't complement Rastrelli's original work. Three years later, Alexander I bestowed the palace on his sister, [[Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia]] \u2013 she later became the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by marriage. Several architects have worked on the edifice since then, and its interiors were continuously refurbished.\n\nFollowing his marriage in 1866 the future [[Tsar Alexander III]] and his wife, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) |Maria Feodorovna]], made the Anichkov Palace their St. Petersburg residence, ensuring its refacing in a variety of historic styles. There their children, including the last Russian emperor, [[Nicholas II of Russia| Nicholas II]], spent their childhood years, and after Alexander III came to the throne in 1881, he preferred to stay at the Anichkov Palace (as opposed to the [[Winter Palace]]). The Anichkov provided the setting for numerous family festivities, including the wedding of Emperor Nicholas's niece [[Princess Irina of Russia |Irina Romanova]] to Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] in 1914. Nicholas II's mother, after becoming dowager empress, continued to have the right of residence in the palace until the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, although she had moved to Kiev away from St. Petersburg. After the revolution the Ministry of Provisions moved in.\n\nFollowing the [[October Revolution]] of November 1917, the Bolshevik government nationalized the Anichkov Palace  and designated it the St. Petersburg City Museum. After 1934, when it was converted into the [[Young Pioneer Palace]], the palace housed over one-hundred after-school clubs for more than 10,000 children.

Designed for the Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] ({{reign | 1741 | 1762}}) in a dazzling [[Baroque]] style, the palace came to be known as the most imposing private residence of the era of Elizabeth Petrovna. Some{{who?|date=November 2019}} suggest architects [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]] were responsible for the design, though it's yet to be substantiated. The main frontage faces the river and was originally connected to it by a [[canal]].\n\nConstruction works continued for thirteen years; when they finally finished in 1754 the Empress Elizabeth presented the palace to her favourite (and likely spouse), Count [[Aleksey Razumovsky]]. After his death in 1771, the palace reverted to the crown, but [[Catherine II of Russia| Catherine the Great of Russia]] ({{reign | 1762 | 1796}}) donated it to her own favourite, [[Grigory Potyomkin |Prince Potemkin]], in 1776. The architect [[Ivan Starov]] was charged with extensive renovations of the palace in the newly-fashionable [[Neoclassical architecture| Neoclassical style]], which were effected in 1778 and 1779. Simultaneously an English garden architect, William Hould, laid out a regular park. [[File:Anichkov.jpg|thumb|The colonnade of Her Imperial Majesty's Cabinet (designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]])]]\n\nUpon Potemkin's demise (1791), the palace was restored to the crown and adapted to accommodate Her Imperial Majesty's Cabinet.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n\nThe last major structural additions occurred in the reign (1801-1825) of Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia| Alexander I]], with [[Giacomo Quarenghi| Quarenghi]]'s construction of the Imperial Cabinet along Nevsky Avenue. The latter structure was formulated in a rigorous Neoclassical style and many{{quantify|date=November 2019}} people feel that it doesn't complement Rastrelli's original work. Three years later, Alexander I bestowed the palace on his sister, [[Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia]] \u2013 she later became the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by marriage. Several architects have worked on the edifice since then, and its interiors were continuously refurbished.\n\nFollowing his marriage in 1866 the future [[Tsar Alexander III]] and his wife, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) |Maria Feodorovna]], made the Anichkov Palace their St. Petersburg residence, ensuring its refacing in a variety of historic styles. There their children, including the last Russian emperor, [[Nicholas II of Russia| Nicholas II]], spent their childhood years, and after Alexander III came to the throne in 1881, he preferred to stay at the Anichkov Palace (as opposed to the [[Winter Palace]]). The Anichkov provided the setting for numerous family festivities, including the wedding of Emperor Nicholas's niece [[Princess Irina of Russia |Irina Romanova]] to Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] in 1914. Nicholas II's mother, after becoming dowager empress, continued to have the right of residence in the palace until the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, although she had moved to Kiev away from St. Petersburg. After the revolution the Ministry of Provisions moved in.\n\nFollowing the [[October Revolution]] of November 1917, the Bolshevik government nationalized the Anichkov Palace  and designated it the St. Petersburg City Museum. After 1934, when it was converted into the [[Young Pioneer Palace]], the palace housed over one-hundred after-school clubs for more than 10,000 children. While a small museum inside is open to the public at selected times, the edifice is normally not accessible to tourists.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Anichkov fontanka.jpg|Anichkov Bridge and Anichkov Palace in 1753.\nImage:Anichkov palace. 1750.jpg|Palace in the 1750s: Elizabethan Baroque at its most flamboyant\nImage:Fontanka anichkov 1838.jpg|Palace in the 1830s: after the Neoclassical renovation\nImage:Anichkov sadovnikov.jpg|Palace in 1862.\nImage:Anichkov interior.jpg|Interior of one of the halls in the early 20th century\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n* Axelrod V.I., Bulankova L.P.
