{"title_page": "FOCAL (programming language)", "text_new": "{{short description|Programming language used on DEC PDP-series machines}}\n{{For|the unrelated programming language on HP calculators|FOCAL (Hewlett-Packard)}}\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name = FOCAL\n| paradigm = \n| released = {{Start date and age|1968}}\n| developer = Richard Merrill, [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]\n| influenced by = [[JOSS]]\n| influenced = [[BASIC-PLUS]]\n| website = \n}}\n'''FOCAL''' is an interactive [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] [[programming language]] based on [[JOSS]] and primarily used on [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-series]] machines. The name is an acronym for '''F'''ormulating '''O'''n-Line '''C'''alculations in '''A'''lgebraic '''L'''anguage.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=1.1}}\n\nFOCAL is very similar to JOSS in terms of the commands it supports and the general syntax of the language. It differs in that many of JOSS' advanced features like [[Range (computer programming)|ranges]] and [[user-defined function]]s were removed to simplify the parser. Some of the keywords were renamed so that they all start with a unique first letter. This allows users to type in programs using single-character statements, further reducing memory needs. This was an important consideration on the [[PDP-8]], which was often limited to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB).\n\nLike JOSS, and later BASICs, FOCAL on the PDP-8 was a complete environment that included a line editor, the interpreter, and input/output routines. The package as a whole was called '''FOCAL-8''', which also ran on the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. When ported to the [[PDP-11]], the resulting '''FOCAL-11''' relied on the underlying [[operating system]], [[RT-11]], to provide file support and editing. The language definition was updated twice, to '''FOCAL-69''' and a very slightly modified '''FOCAL-71'''. A port to the [[Intel 8080]] was also available.\n\nFOCAL is historically notable as the language for the original versions of the early [[video game]]s [[Hamurabi (video game)|''Hamurabi'']] and [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']]. Both were later ported to BASIC where they became much more famous.<ref name=\"TIME\">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |title=Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=2014-04-29 |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205214236/http://time.com/69316/basic/ |archive-date=2016-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> FOCAL was not popular outside the PDP platform and largely disappeared during the move to the [[VAX-11]]. It had a strong revival in the [[Soviet Union]] where PDP-11 clones were used as educational and [[home computer]]s.\n\n==History==\n=== JOSS ===\n[[JOSS]] was released in May 1963 on the one-off [[JOHNNIAC]] computer at [[RAND Corporation]]. Within RAND, use grew rapidly, and the machine, originally constructed in 1953, quickly ran out of capability. JOHNNIAC retired in 1966 and JOSS moved to a newly purchased [[PDP-6]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) first \"big\" machine. Usage continued to grow and by 1970 the system was being used by 500 to 600 users across the country and had spawned a number of innovations such as mobile [[computer terminal]]s that could be wheeled from room to room and plugged in for instant access.<ref name=rand>{{cite techreport |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R918.pdf |title=The JOSS Years: Reflections on an experiment |first=Shirley |last=Marks |date=December 1971 |publisher=Rand}}</ref>\n\nJOSS was extremely influential in the computer field. It emerged just as the [[time-sharing]] concept was being introduced and there was significant interest in man-machine interaction and computers were seeing more widespread use. Whereas most timeshare [[operating system]]s of the era concentrated on user account and file management, leaving the users on their own when it came to programming, JOSS provided these functions and an easily used programming language in a single package. Rand showed the system to a parade of people in the industry.<ref name=rand/>\n\n===FOCAL===\nPorts of JOSS to other platforms began to appear shortly after the PDP-6 version was released. FOCAL was one example of its many offshoots.\n\nWritten by [[Richard Merrill]], FOCAL removed features as required in order to be able to run in the much more limited memory space of the [[PDP-8]] and other 12-bit machines in the DEC lineup. To achieve this, a major change was made to reduce the amount of temporary data, or \"[[State (computer science)|state]]\", needed to parse the statements. One noticeable effect of this decision was that [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] could only be used for [[Branch (computer science)|branches]], in contrast to JOSS, where conditionals can be applied to any statement.\n\nThe other noticeable change was to rearrange the keywords so each started with a unique letter. This simplified the [[Parsing|parser]], which needed to read only the first letter of the command on a line, and then skip forward to the next blank. The list of potential command keywords was a single letter for each. In contrast, JOSS had to continue reading until it had read the entire command word, and then compare that against a list containing complete words.\n\nThe first version of FOCAL was released in 1968 for the [[PDP-8]]. An updated version followed the next year, which was later known as FOCAL-69. The system as a whole, regardless of version, was known as FOCAL-8 when it was ported to other machines in the 12-bit series, including the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. It was popular as it was highly efficient in terms of memory use, which was often severely limited on these machines to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB). The similar FOCAL-11 ran on the [[PDP-11]] under [[RT-11]].\n\n[[Processor Technology]] also offered a version of 8k FOCAL, complete with Lunar Lander, for the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]] system. This was provided for the copying charge of the tape, while the [[source code]] was provided for free with other purchases.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1976-04/page/n49 |title=Watch Your Altair Grow! |magazine=Byte |date=April 1976 |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===BASIC===\nWhile FOCAL was becoming popular on DEC machines, BASIC was becoming a more popular alternative on other platforms. By the late 1960s, a number of companies were making inroads in DEC's minicomputer stronghold selling similar machines running timeshared versions of BASIC. Notable among these was the [[HP 2100]] series, running [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]].{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] had recently joined DEC's PDP-8 Group, just as the company became interested in selling the machine into educational settings. Due to the popularity of BASIC in the educational market, especially with the growing library of BASIC programs from the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ahl found selling the machine with FOCAL was difficult in spite of its advantages.{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}} As he later noted:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | |DEC's FOCAL language was equal to BASIC in most aspects and even better in some, but it had one huge drawback: DEC was unwilling to license it to other computer manufacturers. FOCAL was fighting an uphill battle against BASIC, which was available on GE, Honeywell, HP, and other computers.<br /><br />I think it wound up with a situation like Sony and Betamax. Sony saying, \"Betamax is ours and it is a better format than VHS,\" which it was. But then, JVC saying, \"We have VHS and Toshiba. Hey, do you want to use it? Fine, we'll license it to you for next to nothing.\"{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}}}\n\nAhl took it upon himself to produce a BASIC system for the platform, hiring a company he later learned was a single programmer in Brooklyn to produce a version for the 4&nbsp;kWord PDP-8. DEC began selling packaged versions of the PDP-8 with terminals and the BASIC as the \"EduSystem\" lineup, with larger systems in the series having expanded versions of BASIC, and in some cases, FOCAL and [[FORTRAN]] as well. Some PDP-11 based EduSystems were also created.<ref name=edu>{{cite book |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/tss8/EduSystemHandbookJan73.pdf |title=EduSystem Handbook |page=V |publisher=Digital |date=1973}}</ref>\n\nAhl then began porting programs from FOCAL to BASIC, notably [[Hamurabi (video game)|''The Sumer Game'']] (which he renamed ''Hamurabi''), a version of [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']], and a number of smaller FOCAL demos. Combining his ports with submissions from outside programmers, he managed to collect enough material to have DEC publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in 1973. The book was an immediate success and ultimately ran through three printings to 1975.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s BASIC was a standard feature of all DEC machines and FOCAL use evaporated.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n===Rebirth in the Soviet Union===\nThe PDP-11 had been cloned in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s for military purposes. In the 1980s, single-chip variations similar to the [[LSI-11]] were produced that gave rise to a series of PDP-11 compatible [[home computer]]s. Most notable among several models were the [[Electronika BK]] series, released in 1985. These were initially supplied with FOCAL on a [[ROM cartridge]],<ref>{{cite techreport|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1988-802-8-Stapleton.pdf |title=The Soviet Union and the Personal Computer \"Revolution\" |page=8 |first1=R.A. |last1=Stapleton |first2=S.E. |last2=Goodman |date=June 1988 |publisher=University of Arizona}}</ref> while a BASIC cartridge was an optional add-on. Later models supplied BASIC by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oldcomputermuseum.com/elektronika_bk0010.html |title=Elektronika BK-0010 |website=Old Computer Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe following description is based on FOCAL-69 as seen in the FOCAL-8 language reference manual.{{sfn|Manual|1968}}\n\n===Direct and indirect modes===\nFOCAL followed the JOSS model for interaction via a [[command line interface]]. This allowed users to type in commands in \"direct mode\", which were performed immediately, or to prefix them with a line number, in which case they were added to the program if they were unique, or overrode existing code if the same number had previously been used.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\nThe method of operation is similar to BASIC's \"immediate mode\" vs. \"program mode\". It contrasts with JOSS, in which all commands, both program and direct, were saved and loaded as part of the user's workspace. This allowed JOSS to have commands without line numbers, which they used for {{code|Form}} definitions and other tasks. FOCAL lacked this capability, so those instructions that needed to be loaded and saved became options on other program-mode commands like {{code|Type}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\n===Program statements===\nEvery line in a FOCAL program must start with a line number. As with JOSS, line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. In FOCAL-8, valid line numbers range from 1.01 through 31.99. When printed out, using {{code|WRITE}}, leading zeros will be added so that all line numbers will be a total of five characters including the period, so line 1.10 will be printed as {{code|01.10}}. Statements referring to those lines do not need the leading zeros, for instance, {{code|GOTO 1.10}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nThe number on the left of the period is known as the \"group number\". Groups provide some level of code organization that is lacking in languages like Fortran or BASIC. The primary use of these was to use a group as a [[subroutine]] which can be called with {{code|DO}}, for instance, {{code|DO 5}} which will jump to the subroutine written in group 5. The editor also used these during edit-time, for instance, one could {{code|WRITE 2}} to produce a listing of the code in group 2, or {{code|ERASE 4}} to delete all of the lines in group 4.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nEvery line must start with a command keyword following the line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}} There is no concept of a \"default command\" as is the case in BASIC with its optional {{code|LET}} statement. Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, separated by semicolons. Usually, the behavior is no different than if the statements had been on separate lines, except in the case of FOR loops.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n\n=== Commands ===\n====ASK====\nThe {{code|ASK}} command (abbreviation A) will take a list of strings and variables, echo the strings and store the user input in variables.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|INPUT}}.\n\n 01.01 ASK \"NAME\", NAME\n 01.02 ASK \"COORDINATES\", X, Y\n 01.03 ASK \"A1\",A1,\"OMEGA\",W,\"T0\",T0,\"DAMPING FACTOR\",DAMPINGFACTOR\n\nIf the user doesn't enter a number but enters text, the system will convert the initial character to a number with \"A\"=1, \"B\"=2, etc.\n\n====COMMENT====\nThe {{code|COMMENT}} command (abbreviation C) creates a remark.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|REM}}.\n 01.01 COMMENT: THE SUMER GAME, BY RICHARD MERRILL\n\n====DO====\nThe {{code|DO}} command (abbreviation D) branches execution to a subroutine. It is the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|GOSUB}}. The subroutine is referenced either by group number or line number. If a line number is provided, that single line is run and then returns to the statement after the {{code|DO}}. If no line number is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached or a {{code|RETURN}} is encountered. {{code|RETURN}} is only required to return early from the group, it is not needed at the end of the group.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}}\n 01.15 DO 7.24\n 01.16 DO 8\n\n====FOR====\nThe {{code|FOR}} command (abbreviation F) implements a [[for loop]]. When three arguments are specified, the first is the initial value of the loop variable, the second is the increment, and the third value is the terminating value for the loop. If two values are provided, the first is the initial value and the second is the terminating value, and the increment is set to 1.\n\nIn contrast to other parts of the language where multiple statements on a line are independent, the {{code|FOR}} always runs the statements that follow it on the line before the termination has been met, and then continues to the next line. Thus, loops have to be on a single line, or alternately, call a subroutine with {{code|DO}}. There is no equivalent of BASIC's {{code|NEXT}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n 01.01 FOR X=1,10; TYPE X,!\n 01.02 FOR X=0,10,100; DO 2\n\nA sample FOR loop:\n 01.10 ASK \"HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW ?\",PRINCIPAL\n 01.20 ASK \"FOR HOW MANY YEARS ?\",TERM\n 01.30 FOR RATE=4.0,.5,10;DO 2.0\n 01.40 QUIT\n 02.10 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n 02.20 TYPE \"RATE\",RATE,\"   \",\"INTEREST\",INTEREST,!\n\n====GOTO====\nThe {{code|GOTO}} command (abbreviation G) jumps program execution to the specified line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}} It is identical to the same-named statement in BASIC. Contrast with {{code|GO}}, an indirect command used from the command line that starts programs, the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|RUN}}.\n 01.05 GOTO 1.01\n 02.90 TYPE !!,\"TRY AGAIN.\",!!!!!;GOTO 1.1\n\n====IF====\nThe {{code|IF}} command (abbreviation I) provides a conditional branch based on the sign of the expression. After the numeric expression, the IF command can take one to three line numbers. If the expression is less than zero, execution branches to the first line number;  if equal to zero, to the second line number;  if greater than zero, to the third line number. The language lacked relative operators such as greater than, equal or less than. To branch if X > 5, one must compare X - 5.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n 02.20 IF (25-25) 2.4,2.3,2.4\n 03.01 IF (X) 3.1,3.02,3.1\n\nIF could be short-formed by placing a semicolon (or end of line) beyond the first line number. For instance:\n\n 02.20 IF (X)1.8; TYPE \"Q\"\n 02.30 IF (X)1.8,2.50\n 02.40 TYPE \"P\"\n\nIn this case the test at 2.20 will cause the program to jump to line 1.8 if the test is negative, otherwise it will continue and type \"Q\" to the console. Line 2.30 will jump to 1.8 or 2.5 if the value is negative or zero, and otherwise continue to type \"P\" to the console.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n\n====QUIT====\nThe {{code|QUIT}} command (abbreviation Q) terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|STOP}} or {{code|END}}.\n 01.10 FOR X=-10,1,10;TYPE X\n 01.20 QUIT\n\n====RETURN====\nThe {{code|RETURN}} command (abbreviation R) branches execution from a subroutine back to the calling location.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} The use of {{code|RETURN}} is optional at the last line of a subroutine, a subroutine returns at the last line in the group anyway. The following is a sample subroutine for converting a yes/no prompt into a value.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n 22.78 COMMENT: 'YES OR NO' SUBROUTINE\n 22.80 ASK \"ANSWER YES OR NO ?  \",AN\n 22.82 IF (AN-0YES)22.84,22.86\n 22.84 IF (AN-0NO)22.8,22.88,22.8\n 22.86 SET X=2;RETURN\n 22.88 SET X=1;RETURN\n\n====SET====\nThe {{code|SET}} command (abbreviation S) assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.3}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LET}}.\n 01.30 SET PI=3.14156\n 01.60 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n\n====TYPE ====\nThe {{code|TYPE}} command (abbreviation T) provides for output of one or more items separated by commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.1}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|PRINT}}.\n\nItems can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, or a variety of control characters. The control characters include the {{code|!}} to output a carriage return and line feed, {{code|#}} for the carriage return alone, and {{code|:}} for a tab character. Control characters can be strung together, for instance, {{code|!!!}} will output three CR/LFs without the need to separate them with commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n\n TYPE [NUMBERS, E1, \"TEXT\", !, #, :, $ OR %] ...OUTPUT\n 01.10 TYPE \"HI THERE, GOOD LOOKING.

The default format was {{code|%8.4}}, meaning a maximum of eight digits and four to the right of the period.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.2}} So, for instance:\n\n SET A=67823\n TYPE %6.01,A\n =  67823.0\n TYPE %5,A\n = 67823\n TYPE %8.03,A\n =   67823.000\n TYPE %,A\n = 6.7823E4\n\nNote the extra leading spaces in some examples, padding out the full defined width. Using % alone caused the output to be printed in \"floating point format\" using the E.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.3}}\n\nA special control character was {{code|$}} which caused a table of all defined variables and their values to be printed. Only the first two letters of the name will be printed, padded with a zero if need be. Arrays elements are printed on separate lines and variables with only one element will be indexed (00). For example:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.5}}\n\n TYPE $\n A0(00)=67823\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariable names may start with any letter except F (F is reserved for functions) and may contain any sequence of letters and numbers. However, only the first two characters are significant. For instance, the following code sample from ''FOCAL: A New Conversational Language''<ref>{{cite book |title=FOCAL: A New Conversational Language |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/focal69.html |publisher=Digital}}</ref> refers to the same variable as DESTINATION and then DES. Internally, both references refer to a value designated DE:\n 01.80 ASK DESTINATION\n 02.30 IF (DES-14) 2.4,3.1,2.4\n\nAny variable may be treated as an array, allowing subscripts from -2048 through 2047.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n\n=== Math ===\nFOCAL-69 contained only five mathematical operators:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n* {{code|^}} for exponents - the exponent is converted to a 12-bit integer\n* {{code|*}} for multiplication\n* {{code|/}} for division\n* {{code|+}} for addition\n* {{code|-}} for subtraction\n\nOne curiosity of FOCAL was that the operators all had independent precedence, as in the order above. That means that the formula {{code|SET T{{=}}2-3+1}}, it would be evaluated in the order 2-(3+1) and thus produce -2. This was very different than most languages, where the + and - had equal precedence and would be evaluated (2-3)+1 to produce 0.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems.\n\nFOCAL was unusual in that mathematical expressions could use (), [] and <> interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} For instance, the following is a valid expression:\n\n   01.30 SET A=<10*[5+1]*(1+5)>\n\nAll of these are the same level of precedence and read left-to-right when at the same level, so this statement will be evaluated [], then (), then <>, to produce 360.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n\nThe language contained the following built-in functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.10}}\n* {{code|FABS()}} - Absolute value\n* {{code|FATN()}} - Arctangent\n* {{code|FCOS()}} - Cosine of argument in radians\n* {{code|FEXP()}} - Natural base to the power of the argument\n* {{code|FITR()}} - Integer part of the argument\n* {{code|FLOG()}} - Naperian log\n* {{code|FRAN()}} - Random number\n* {{code|FSGN()}} - Sign of the argument; FSGN(0)=1 in FOCAL-69, but FSGN(0)=0 in FOCAL-71 as well as later versions\n* {{code|FSIN()}} - Sine of an angle given in radians\n* {{code|FSQT()}} - Square root\n\n===Other functions===\nFOCAL also included a number of special-purpose functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=A.3}}\n\n* {{code|FDIS}} took two values and plotted a dot on the screen of graphical terminals\n* {{code|FADC}} read a value from a numbered analog input and returned an integer value\n\n==Environment commands==\n====Running programs====\nFOCAL used {{code|GOTO}} in the editor to start a program. However, a rule-of-thumb was to shorten this to {{code|GO}}. This is the equivalent of {{code|RUN}} in BASIC. {{code|GOTO}} can also be used in the editor to start execution at a specified line.\n\n====Editing commands====\nNew lines are entered into the program by simply beginning the command with a line number.  The editing commands were ERASE (abbreviation E),{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} MODIFY (abbreviation M){{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.8}} and WRITE (abbreviation W):{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n* {{code|ERASE}} - zeroes out all variables. this is sometimes found within programs to reset them\n* {{code|ERASE <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - deletes the statement at the specified line\n* {{code|ERASE <nowiki><group number></nowiki>}} - deletes all statements in the specified group\n* {{code|ERASE ALL}} - deletes the entire program\n* {{code|MODIFY <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - allows the programmer to edit the specified line\n* {{code|WRITE <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - display the statement at the specified line\n* {{code|WRITE <nowiki><group number></nowiki>}} - display all statements in the specified group\n* {{code|WRITE ALL}} - display the specified program\n\n====File commands====\nThe file command was OPEN (abbreviation O):\n* {{code|OPEN INPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to read from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN OUTPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to write from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE INPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume input\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE OUTPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume output\n* {{code|OUTPUT CLOSE}} - output the buffer and close the file\n\n====Library commands====\nFOCAL included the ability to manage collections of FOCAL programs as a code library. Programs could call other programs in a chain fashion using {{code|LIBRARY CALL}}, or call a single subroutine in another program using {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB}}. Program names could be six characters long. The LIBRARY command (abbreviation L) had the following sub-commands:\n\n* {{code|LIBRARY DELETE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - delete a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY LIST [device:][file name]}} - catalog\n* {{code|LIBRARY RUN [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [line number]}} - chain the program, optionally resuming at the specified line number\n* {{code|LIBRARY SAVE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - save the program\n* {{code|LIBRARY EXIT}} - return to the PDP-8 monitor program\nFOCAL-71 added:\n* {{code|LIBRARY CALL [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - load a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [group number]}} - call a subroutine in an external program\n\n==Error codes==\nSince the interpreter lacked sufficient memory space to store error messages, or even a table of error numbers, FOCAL used a workaround by reporting the address of the error-detecting code as a fixed-point number. For example, the [[division by zero]] error was detected it would report {{code|?28.73 @ 01.10}}, where 28.73 represents the code checking for this error at memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words, and 01.10 is the line number where the error occurred. Pages in the PDP-8 were 128 bytes long, so this address translates to location 3657.\n\n==Changes between versions==\nDEC released three versions of FOCAL for the PDP-8 series, the original, known simply as FOCAL, and two updated versions, \nFOCAL,1969 and FOCAL,1971. FOCAL,1969 was largely identical to the original, but FOCAL,1971 was major update that added file handling, new mathematics, and a variety of other changes. In contrast to the first two versions, which were stand-alone systems, FOCAL,1971 was based on the emerging [[OS/8]] (then still known as PS/8) and relied more heavily on that operating system for file handling and editing.\n\n===FOCAL,1971===\nOne change in the new version was a 10-digit math package for added precision. The {{code|FSGN}} function now returned zero if the input expression evaluated to zero. Previously this would return one. The {{code|FRAN}} now used a better algorithm that produced more randomly distributed numbers. It also added the new {{code|FIN}} function that took a string and returned its [[ASCII]] value (akin to BASIC's {{code|ASC}}) and {{code|FOUT}} which took a number and returned a string with that ASCII character ({{code|CHR}}.\n\nAs all of these options used up limited memory, when started, FOCAL,1971 entered a dialog that asked the user what features they wanted to use.\n\n==Comparison with JOSS==\nFOCUL is, for all intents, a cleaned-up version of JOSS with changes to make the syntax terser and easier to parse. Almost all FOCAL commands have a one-to-one correspondence with JOSS and differ only in details. A few features of JOSS were missing in FOCAL.\n\nOne major difference is that JOSS included a complete set of comparison operations and a [[boolean logic]] system that operated within if and for constructs. Furthermore, the ifs and loops could be applied to any statement, in contrast to FOCAL, where the only operation either could carry out was the equivalent to a goto. For instance, in JOSS, one could:\n\n  1.10 Type A if X>10.\n  1.20 Type i for i=1(1)10.\n\nWhich would optionally print A based on the test, and then print the numbers 1 to 10. In contrast, FOCAL lacked the ability to compare values, and loops were applied by skipping to the next line when they completed. The equivalent code in FOCAL would be:\n\n 1.10 IF (X-10) ,,1.30\n 1.20 TYPE A!\n 1.30 FOR I=1,1,10;TYPE I,!\n\nJOSS' implementation makes common constructs easier to build and more closely match the programmer's intentions, at the cost of making the runtime more complex. For instance, JOSS allowed ranges in loops to be described in a flexible fashion, for instance, 1,2,3,10(5)50,75,78. This flexibility comes at a cost; in FOCAL the start, stop and step can be written down in a custom in-memory structure and easily updated as the loop is performed. In contrast, the JOSS system requires a pointer to what might be, but often isn't, a more complex expression that has to be stepped over with more complex parsing code.\n\nIn terms of making the code terser, changes were relatively minor. For instance, JOSS' {{code|Do part 20.}} becomes the slightly smaller FOCAL {{code|DO 20}}, while {{code|Do step 20.1}} becomes {{code|DO 20.1}}. Command keywords were also shortened where possible, so JOSS' {{code|Demand}} becomes FOCAL's {{code|ASK}}, both to make it shorter as well as allow the letter D to be uniquely used for {{code|DO}}. The period needed to indicate the end of a line in JOSS was removed.\n\nTo simplify the parser, some FOCAL options were removed. For instance, JOSS could perform multiple assignments with {{code|Set S{{=}}P, P{{=}}Q, Q{{=}}S.}} while in FOCAL these had to be made individual statements, {{code|SET S{{=}}P; SET P{{=}}Q; SET Q{{=}}S}}. Likewise, JOSS' {{code|Form}}, used to format output, was combined into FOCAL's {{code|TYPE}} with the {{code|%}}.\n\n==Comparison with BASIC==\nComparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were inevitable since both languages were common on [[minicomputer]]s of the same era, and the two languages have much in common in terms of syntax and structure. In most cases, there is a direct conversion of FOCAL code to and from BASIC. For instance, to ask the user to input a value, in FOCAL one would:\n\n  ASK \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nwhile in BASIC the equivalent is:\n\n  INPUT \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nWith the exception of a few features that were missing from one or the other, and some relatively minor differences in syntax, the two languages are very similar.\n\nOne notable exception is the {{code|IF}} in BASIC, which allowed any statement to be placed after the {{code|THEN}}, making it more similar with JOSS' control structures. BASIC reversed the ordering of the code compared to JOSS, placing the conditional expression at the start of the line rather than the end; in BASIC one uses {{code|IF this THEN that}} as opposed to {{code|that IF this}} in JOSS. BASIC's version has the advantage that the runtime could immediately abort reading the rest of the statement if the expression was not true. In contrast, FOCAL's {{code|IF}} was more like BASIC's [[computed goto]], {{code|ON X GOTO 10,20,30}}, but the {{code|ON...GOTO}} allowed any number of lines as targets, as opposed to only three for negative, zero and positive as in JOSS and FOCAL.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that FOCAL lacked inherent support for [[string (computer science)|strings]] as data elements that could be assigned to variables. As was the case in early BASICs or FORTRAN versions before the addition of strings (in F77), this limitation was generally avoided through the use of literal strings in input and output commands. It was only when one had to manipulate individual strings or characters within them that this became a significant problem.\n\nAs string variables were not supported, inputting a string used a [[kludge]] that converted any characters typed in by the user to their numeric character value. For example, if one typed \"HELLO\" at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to \"8\", the numeric value of \"H\" in the PDP-8's [[six-bit character code]]s (\"H\" is the eighth letter). It would then interpret the \"E\" as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute \"8\" to the \"LLO\" power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a particularly helpful response. Nevertheless, by asking questions that would be responded to using single-letter responses, like {{code|Do you need instructions, Y or N\"}}, programmers could test the result against known character values to produce what looked like character input.\n\nFOCAL's PDP-8 implementation used a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] representation that represented numbers as four 12-bit words, forty-eight bits in total, with thirty-six bits of mantissa and twelve bits of exponent. This allowed for both significantly higher precision and a significantly wider range of values than most contemporary interpreters, making FOCAL a reasonable choice for serious numerical work. This high precision, and good choices for default decimal output formatting, meant that difficulties with binary-to-decimal rounding were not evident to beginning users. For comparison, [[Microsoft BASIC]] initially used a [[Microsoft Binary Format|32-bit format]], while later versions expanded this to 40-bits. Most BASICs had problems with rounding that led to simple equations resulting in tiny non-zero remainders.\n\nIt is generally agreed that FOCAL was more efficient in its use of resources than comparable BASIC systems. On a typical machine of the day, often with 6 to 24 kilobytes of [[magnetic-core memory]], FOCAL could handle larger and more complex programming tasks than BASIC.\n\n== Versions and spinoffs ==\nThe Coca-Cola Corporation used a customized version of FOCAL called COKE.\n\nFOCAL was later implemented on the PDP-7, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, PDP-5 and LINC-8.\n\nThe FOCAL manual showed how to add commands to the FOCAL parser, so many sites added specialized commands for operating custom hardware.\n\nThe [[DECUS|Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society]] collected many patches and enhancements for FOCAL. There were even major enhanced offshoots of FOCAL, such as FOCAL-W, which added many features, including better mass storage file I/O and even virtual variable memory.\n\nIn [[Russia]], it saw use as late as the early 1990s in mass-produced home computers of the [[Electronika BK]] series.\n\n==Example code==\nThe original Lunar Lander makes an excellent example for examining FOCAL code, as it uses most of the features of the language.

This was almost universal in FOCAL programs (and JOSS), as the line number scheme made such constructs easy to use. This program uses nine routines. The first, group 1, simply prints out the instructions using the {{code|T}}ype statement and sets the initial values for the run. The mass of fuel is not recorded directly, instead, it uses the current {{code|M}}ass and empty mass, {{code|N}}, so the remaining fuel is M-N and the lander runs out of fuel when M-N is 0. Also note the {{code|E}}rase at the end of line 1.20, which resets all the variable values.\n\nThe main game loop is driven by group 2. As the code \"falls\" through group 1 into group 2 during the first run, the initial values are printed out in the first two lines. Near the end of line 2.20, the user is {{code|A}}sked to input the burn rate as {{code|K}}, and then the loop timer is reset using {{code|S T{{=}}10}}. Line 2.70 tests the user's input against several possibilities, if it is over 200 or below 8 it types \"NOT POSSIBLE\" and a row of periods, and then loops back to ask the user to try again. If the value is between these values, it jumps forward to group 3. Note that the limited capabilities of FOCAL's {{code|IF}} command are evident here, in BASIC this could be reduced to a single {{code|IF K>200 OR K<8 THEN...}}\n\nGroup 3 first tests to see if the fuel has run out, and jumps to group 4 if it has. Then it tests if the 10-second period in {{code|T}} has expired and, if so, loops back to print everything out again, which has the side-effect of resetting T and S to 10. Line 3.40 tests to see if the amount of fuel burned this period, S*K, will reduce the mass of the vehicle as a whole, S*K-M, beyond the empty weight, N. If not, it moves on, if it will, it instead sets the loop timer to the amount of time the remaining fuel will burn, thus ending the loop early. In either case, it calls group 9 to update the velocity and position. It then loops over groups 7, 8 and 9 until the value of I converges.\n\nWhen the 10-second timer runs out, or it reaches the end due to the fuel test in line 3.10 or the altitude test in 7.10. In the latter cases, it will jump to group 4 and fall through to group 5, or jump to group 5 directly. Group 5 types the end-of-game results and then asks the user if they'd like to try again. If so, it jumps to 1.20 to clear out all values and print the headers again, if not if falls through to 5.98 and {{code|Q}}uits.\n\n==See also==\n*[[JOSS]], the Rand language that inspired FOCAL\n*[[MUMPS]], a data-manipulation language based on JOSS and FOCAL concepts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n |title=FOCAL Programming Manual \n |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation \n |date=1968 \n |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-08-AJAB-D%20PDP-8-I%20FOCAL%20Programming%20Manual.pdf \n|ref=CITEREFManual1968\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/216469/A_basic_history_of_BASIC_on_its_50th_birthday.php\n |title=A basic history of BASIC on its 50th birthday\n |website=Gamasutra\n |date=1 May 2014\n |first=John |last=Szczepaniak\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite interview\n |first=Kevin |last=Savetz\n |date=April 2013\n |title=Dave Ahl and Betsy Ahl\n |url=https://computingpioneers.com/index.php?title=Dave_Ahl_and_Betsy_Ahl\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[ftp://ftp.pdp8.net/software/games/focal/ FOCAL source code], FOCAL source for several programs, including Lunar Lander, Sumer Game, and others\n*[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/ DEC's FOCAL 1969 Promotional Booklet]\n*[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ The Computer History Simulation Project (Focal is available as a free download here)]\n*ftp://www.cozx.com/pub/langs/focal.tar.gz C-source version that runs under several operating systems, including Linux\n*[http://www.catb.org/retro the C-source for a modern DOS version suitable for teaching]  \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525101809/http://www.libex.ru/detail/book91959.html Abramov V.A.

The name is an acronym for '''F'''ormulating '''O'''n-Line '''C'''alculations in '''A'''lgebraic '''L'''anguage.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=1.1}}\n\nFOCAL is very similar to JOSS in terms of the commands it supports and the general syntax of the language. It differs in that many of JOSS' advanced features like [[Range (computer programming)|ranges]] and [[user-defined function]]s were removed to simplify the parser. Some of the keywords were renamed so that they all start with a unique first letter. This allows users to type in programs using single-character statements, further reducing memory needs. This was an important consideration on the [[PDP-8]], which was often limited to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB), and FOCAL was popular on DEC machines for this reason.\n\nLike JOSS, and later BASICs, FOCAL on the PDP-8 was a complete environment that included a line editor, the interpreter, and input/output routines. The package as a whole was called '''FOCAL-8''', which also ran on the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. When ported to the [[PDP-11]], the resulting '''FOCAL-11''' relied on the underlying [[operating system]], [[RT-11]], to provide file support and editing. The language definition was updated twice, to '''FOCAL-69''' and a very slightly modified '''FOCAL-71'''. A port to the [[Intel 8080]] was also available.\n\nFOCAL is historically notable as the language for the original versions of the early [[video game]]s [[Hamurabi (video game)|''Hamurabi'']] and [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']]. Both were later ported to BASIC where they became much more famous.<ref name=\"TIME\">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |title=Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=2014-04-29 |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205214236/http://time.com/69316/basic/ |archive-date=2016-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> FOCAL was not popular outside the PDP platform and largely disappeared during the move to the [[VAX-11]]. It had a strong revival in the [[Soviet Union]] where PDP-11 clones were used as educational and [[home computer]]s.\n\n==History==\n=== JOSS ===\n[[JOSS]] was released in May 1963 on the one-off [[JOHNNIAC]] computer at [[RAND Corporation]]. Within RAND, use grew rapidly, and the machine, originally constructed in 1953, quickly ran out of capability. JOHNNIAC retired in 1966 and JOSS moved to a newly purchased [[PDP-6]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) first \"big\" machine. Usage continued to grow and by 1970 the system was being used by 500 to 600 users across the country and had spawned a number of innovations such as mobile [[computer terminal]]s that could be wheeled from room to room and plugged in for instant access.<ref name=rand>{{cite techreport |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R918.pdf |title=The JOSS Years: Reflections on an experiment |first=Shirley |last=Marks |date=December 1971 |publisher=Rand}}</ref>\n\nJOSS was extremely influential in the computer field. It emerged just as the [[time-sharing]] concept was being introduced and there was significant interest in man-machine interaction and computers were seeing more widespread use. Whereas most timeshare [[operating system]]s of the era concentrated on user account and file management, leaving the users on their own when it came to programming, JOSS provided these functions and an easily used programming language in a single package. Rand showed the system to a parade of people in the industry.<ref name=rand/>\n\n===FOCAL===\nPorts of JOSS to other platforms began to appear shortly after the PDP-6 version was released. FOCAL was one example of its many offshoots.\n\nWritten by [[Richard Merrill]], FOCAL removed features as required in order to be able to run in the much more limited memory space of the [[PDP-8]] and other 12-bit machines in the DEC lineup. To achieve this, a major change was made to reduce the amount of temporary data, or \"[[State (computer science)|state]]\", needed to parse the statements. One noticeable effect of this decision was that [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] could only be used for [[Branch (computer science)|branches]], in contrast to JOSS, where conditionals can be applied to any statement.\n\nThe other noticeable change was to rearrange the keywords so each started with a unique letter. This simplified the [[Parsing|parser]], which needed to read only the first letter of the command on a line, and then skip forward to the next blank. The list of potential command keywords was a single letter for each. In contrast, JOSS had to continue reading until it had read the entire command word, and then compare that against a list containing complete words.\n\nThe first version of FOCAL was released in 1968 for the [[PDP-8]]. An updated version followed the next year, which was later known as FOCAL-69. The system as a whole, regardless of version, was known as FOCAL-8 when it was ported to other machines in the 12-bit series, including the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. It was popular as it was highly efficient in terms of memory use, which was often severely limited on these machines to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB). The similar FOCAL-11 ran on the [[PDP-11]] under [[RT-11]].\n\n[[Processor Technology]] also offered a version of 8k FOCAL, complete with Lunar Lander, for the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]] system. This was provided for the copying charge of the tape, while the [[source code]] was provided for free with other purchases.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1976-04/page/n49 |title=Watch Your Altair Grow! |magazine=Byte |date=April 1976 |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===BASIC===\nWhile FOCAL was becoming popular on DEC machines, BASIC was becoming a more popular alternative on other platforms. By the late 1960s, a number of companies were making inroads in DEC's minicomputer stronghold selling similar machines running timeshared versions of BASIC. Notable among these was the [[HP 2100]] series, running [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]].{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] had recently joined DEC's PDP-8 Group, just as the company became interested in selling the machine into educational settings. Due to the popularity of BASIC in the educational market, especially with the growing library of BASIC programs from the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ahl found selling the machine with FOCAL was difficult in spite of its advantages.{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}} As he later noted:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | |DEC's FOCAL language was equal to BASIC in most aspects and even better in some, but it had one huge drawback: DEC was unwilling to license it to other computer manufacturers. FOCAL was fighting an uphill battle against BASIC, which was available on GE, Honeywell, HP, and other computers.<br /><br />I think it wound up with a situation like Sony and Betamax. Sony saying, \"Betamax is ours and it is a better format than VHS,\" which it was. But then, JVC saying, \"We have VHS and Toshiba. Hey, do you want to use it? Fine, we'll license it to you for next to nothing.\"{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}}}\n\nAhl took it upon himself to produce a BASIC system for the platform, hiring a company he later learned was a single programmer in Brooklyn to produce a version for the 4&nbsp;kWord PDP-8. DEC began selling packaged versions of the PDP-8 with terminals and the BASIC as the \"EduSystem\" lineup, with larger systems in the series having expanded versions of BASIC, and in some cases, FOCAL and [[FORTRAN]] as well. Some PDP-11 based EduSystems were also created.<ref name=edu>{{cite book |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/tss8/EduSystemHandbookJan73.pdf |title=EduSystem Handbook |page=V |publisher=Digital |date=1973}}</ref>\n\nAhl then began porting programs from FOCAL to BASIC, notably [[Hamurabi (video game)|''The Sumer Game'']] (which he renamed ''Hamurabi''), a version of [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']], and a number of smaller FOCAL demos. Combining his ports with submissions from outside programmers, he managed to collect enough material to have DEC publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in 1973. The book was an immediate success and ultimately ran through three printings to 1975.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s BASIC was a standard feature of all DEC machines and FOCAL use evaporated.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n===Rebirth in the Soviet Union===\nThe PDP-11 had been cloned in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s for military purposes. In the 1980s, single-chip variations similar to the [[LSI-11]] were produced that gave rise to a series of PDP-11 compatible [[home computer]]s. Most notable among several models were the [[Electronika BK]] series, released in 1985. These were initially supplied with FOCAL on a [[ROM cartridge]],<ref>{{cite techreport|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1988-802-8-Stapleton.pdf |title=The Soviet Union and the Personal Computer \"Revolution\" |page=8 |first1=R.A. |last1=Stapleton |first2=S.E. |last2=Goodman |date=June 1988 |publisher=University of Arizona}}</ref> while a BASIC cartridge was an optional add-on. Later models supplied BASIC by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oldcomputermuseum.com/elektronika_bk0010.html |title=Elektronika BK-0010 |website=Old Computer Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe following description is based on FOCAL-69 as seen in the FOCAL-8 language reference manual.{{sfn|Manual|1968}}\n\n===Direct and indirect modes===\nFOCAL followed the JOSS model for interaction via a [[command line interface]]. This allowed users to type in commands in \"direct mode\", which were performed immediately, or to prefix them with a line number, in which case they were added to the program if they were unique, or overrode existing code if the same number had previously been used.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\nThe method of operation is similar to BASIC's \"immediate mode\" vs. \"program mode\". It contrasts with JOSS, in which all commands, both program and direct, were saved and loaded as part of the user's workspace. This allowed JOSS to have commands without line numbers, which they used for {{code|Form}} definitions and other tasks. FOCAL lacked this capability, so those instructions that needed to be loaded and saved became options on other program-mode commands like {{code|Type}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\n===Program statements===\nEvery line in a FOCAL program must start with a line number. As with JOSS, line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. In FOCAL-8, valid line numbers range from 1.01 through 31.99. When printed out, using {{code|WRITE}}, leading zeros will be added so that all line numbers will be a total of five characters including the period, so line 1.10 will be printed as {{code|01.10}}. Statements referring to those lines do not need the leading zeros, for instance, {{code|GOTO 1.10}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nThe number on the left of the period is known as the \"group number\". Groups provide some level of code organization that is lacking in languages like Fortran or BASIC. The primary use of these was to use a group as a [[subroutine]] which can be called with {{code|DO}}, for instance, {{code|DO 5}} which will jump to the subroutine written in group 5. The editor also used these during edit-time, for instance, one could {{code|WRITE 2}} to produce a listing of the code in group 2, or {{code|ERASE 4}} to delete all of the lines in group 4.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nEvery line must start with a command keyword following the line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}} There is no concept of a \"default command\" as is the case in BASIC with its optional {{code|LET}} statement. Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, separated by semicolons. Usually, the behavior is no different than if the statements had been on separate lines, except in the case of FOR loops.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n\n=== Commands ===\n====ASK====\nThe {{code|ASK}} command (abbreviation A) will take a list of strings and variables, echo the strings and store the user input in variables.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|INPUT}}.\n\n 01.01 ASK \"NAME\", NAME\n 01.02 ASK \"COORDINATES\", X, Y\n 01.03 ASK \"A1\",A1,\"OMEGA\",W,\"T0\",T0,\"DAMPING FACTOR\",DAMPINGFACTOR\n\nIf the user doesn't enter a number but enters text, the system will convert the initial character to a number with \"A\"=1, \"B\"=2, etc.\n\n====COMMENT====\nThe {{code|COMMENT}} command (abbreviation C) creates a remark.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|REM}}.\n 01.01 COMMENT: THE SUMER GAME, BY RICHARD MERRILL\n\n====DO====\nThe {{code|DO}} command (abbreviation D) branches execution to a subroutine. It is the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|GOSUB}}. The subroutine is referenced either by group number or line number. If a line number is provided, that single line is run and then returns to the statement after the {{code|DO}}. If no line number is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached or a {{code|RETURN}} is encountered. {{code|RETURN}} is only required to return early from the group, it is not needed at the end of the group.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}}\n 01.15 DO 7.24\n 01.16 DO 8\n\n====FOR====\nThe {{code|FOR}} command (abbreviation F) implements a [[for loop]]. When three arguments are specified, the first is the initial value of the loop variable, the second is the increment, and the third value is the terminating value for the loop. If two values are provided, the first is the initial value and the second is the terminating value, and the increment is set to 1.\n\nIn contrast to other parts of the language where multiple statements on a line are independent, the {{code|FOR}} always runs the statements that follow it on the line before the termination has been met, and then continues to the next line. Thus, loops have to be on a single line, or alternately, call a subroutine with {{code|DO}}. There is no equivalent of BASIC's {{code|NEXT}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n 01.01 FOR X=1,10; TYPE X,!\n 01.02 FOR X=0,10,100; DO 2\n\nA sample FOR loop:\n 01.10 ASK \"HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW ?\",PRINCIPAL\n 01.20 ASK \"FOR HOW MANY YEARS ?\",TERM\n 01.30 FOR RATE=4.0,.5,10;DO 2.0\n 01.40 QUIT\n 02.10 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n 02.20 TYPE \"RATE\",RATE,\"   \",\"INTEREST\",INTEREST,!\n\n====GOTO====\nThe {{code|GOTO}} command (abbreviation G) jumps program execution to the specified line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}} It is identical to the same-named statement in BASIC. Contrast with {{code|GO}}, an indirect command used from the command line that starts programs, the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|RUN}}.\n 01.05 GOTO 1.01\n 02.90 TYPE !!,\"TRY AGAIN.\",!!!!!;GOTO 1.1\n\n====IF====\nThe {{code|IF}} command (abbreviation I) provides a conditional branch based on the sign of the expression. After the numeric expression, the IF command can take one to three line numbers. If the expression is less than zero, execution branches to the first line number;  if equal to zero, to the second line number;  if greater than zero, to the third line number. The language lacked relative operators such as greater than, equal or less than. To branch if X > 5, one must compare X - 5.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n 02.20 IF (25-25) 2.4,2.3,2.4\n 03.01 IF (X) 3.1,3.02,3.1\n\nIF could be short-formed by placing a semicolon (or end of line) beyond the first line number. For instance:\n\n 02.20 IF (X)1.8; TYPE \"Q\"\n 02.30 IF (X)1.8,2.50\n 02.40 TYPE \"P\"\n\nIn this case the test at 2.20 will cause the program to jump to line 1.8 if the test is negative, otherwise it will continue and type \"Q\" to the console. Line 2.30 will jump to 1.8 or 2.5 if the value is negative or zero, and otherwise continue to type \"P\" to the console.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n\n====QUIT====\nThe {{code|QUIT}} command (abbreviation Q) terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|STOP}} or {{code|END}}.\n 01.10 FOR X=-10,1,10;TYPE X\n 01.20 QUIT\n\n====RETURN====\nThe {{code|RETURN}} command (abbreviation R) branches execution from a subroutine back to the calling location.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} The use of {{code|RETURN}} is optional at the last line of a subroutine, a subroutine returns at the last line in the group anyway. The following is a sample subroutine for converting a yes/no prompt into a value.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n 22.78 COMMENT: 'YES OR NO' SUBROUTINE\n 22.80 ASK \"ANSWER YES OR NO ?  \",AN\n 22.82 IF (AN-0YES)22.84,22.86\n 22.84 IF (AN-0NO)22.8,22.88,22.8\n 22.86 SET X=2;RETURN\n 22.88 SET X=1;RETURN\n\n====SET====\nThe {{code|SET}} command (abbreviation S) assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.3}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LET}}.\n 01.30 SET PI=3.14156\n 01.60 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n\n====TYPE ====\nThe {{code|TYPE}} command (abbreviation T) provides for output of one or more items separated by commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.1}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|PRINT}}.\n\nItems can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, or a variety of control characters. The control characters include the {{code|!}} to output a carriage return and line feed, {{code|#}} for the carriage return alone, and {{code|:}} for a tab character. Control characters can be strung together, for instance, {{code|!!!}} will output three CR/LFs without the need to separate them with commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n\n TYPE [NUMBERS, E1, \"TEXT\", !, #, :, $ OR %] ...OUTPUT\n 01.10 TYPE \"HI THERE, GOOD LOOKING.  HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW?\",!\n 01.50 TYPE \"INTEREST\",INTEREST,!\n 01.80 TYPE \"THE INTEREST FOR\",TERM,\" YEARS\",!,\"IS\",INTEREST, \" DOLLARS.\",!!\n 01.90 TYPE \"NEW YORK\",!,\"WASHINGTON\",!,\"ATLANTA\",!,\"DALLAS\",!\n 02.10 TYPE \"X\",X,\"   \",\"X^2\",X^2,\"   \",\"SQRT\",FSQT(X)\n 03.20 TYPE \".\",#\n 02.20 TYPE !!!!!\n\n{{code|TYPE}} also included an optional format specifier indicated using the format {{code|%x.yz}}, where x is the number of digits to the left of the decimal, and yz is the number of digits to the right of the period. The default format was {{code|%8.4}}, meaning a maximum of eight digits and four to the right of the period.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.2}} So, for instance:\n\n SET A=67823\n TYPE %6.01,A\n =  67823.0\n TYPE %5,A\n = 67823\n TYPE %8.03,A\n =   67823.000\n TYPE %,A\n = 6.7823E4\n\nNote the extra leading spaces in some examples, padding out the full defined width. Using % alone caused the output to be printed in \"floating point format\" using the E.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.3}}\n\nA special control character was {{code|$}} which caused a table of all defined variables and their values to be printed. Only the first two letters of the name will be printed, padded with a zero if need be. Arrays elements are printed on separate lines and variables with only one element will be indexed (00). For example:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.5}}\n\n TYPE $\n A0(00)=67823\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariable names may start with any letter except F (F is reserved for functions) and may contain any sequence of letters and numbers. However, only the first two characters are significant. For instance, the following code sample from ''FOCAL: A New Conversational Language''<ref>{{cite book |title=FOCAL: A New Conversational Language |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/focal69.html |publisher=Digital}}</ref> refers to the same variable as DESTINATION and then DES. Internally, both references refer to a value designated DE:\n 01.80 ASK DESTINATION\n 02.30 IF (DES-14) 2.4,3.1,2.4\n\nAny variable may be treated as an array, allowing subscripts from -2048 through 2047.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n\n=== Math ===\nFOCAL-69 contained only five mathematical operators:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n* {{code|^}} for exponents - the exponent is converted to a 12-bit integer\n* {{code|*}} for multiplication\n* {{code|/}} for division\n* {{code|+}} for addition\n* {{code|-}} for subtraction\n\nOne curiosity of FOCAL was that the operators all had independent precedence, as in the order above. That means that the formula {{code|SET T{{=}}2-3+1}}, it would be evaluated in the order 2-(3+1) and thus produce -2. This was very different than most languages, where the + and - had equal precedence and would be evaluated (2-3)+1 to produce 0.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems.\n\nFOCAL was unusual in that mathematical expressions could use (), [] and <> interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} For instance, the following is a valid expression:\n\n   01.30 SET A=<10*[5+1]*(1+5)>\n\nAll of these are the same level of precedence and read left-to-right when at the same level, so this statement will be evaluated [], then (), then <>, to produce 360.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n\nThe language contained the following built-in functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.10}}\n* {{code|FABS()}} - Absolute value\n* {{code|FATN()}} - Arctangent\n* {{code|FCOS()}} - Cosine of argument in radians\n* {{code|FEXP()}} - Natural base to the power of the argument\n* {{code|FITR()}} - Integer part of the argument\n* {{code|FLOG()}} - Naperian log\n* {{code|FRAN()}} - Random number\n* {{code|FSGN()}} - Sign of the argument; FSGN(0)=1 in FOCAL-69, but FSGN(0)=0 in FOCAL-71 as well as later versions\n* {{code|FSIN()}} - Sine of an angle given in radians\n* {{code|FSQT()}} - Square root\n\n===Other functions===\nFOCAL also included a number of special-purpose functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=A.3}}\n\n* {{code|FDIS}} took two values and plotted a dot on the screen of graphical terminals\n* {{code|FADC}} read a value from a numbered analog input and returned an integer value\n\n==Environment commands==\n====Running programs====\nFOCAL used {{code|GOTO}} in the editor to start a program. However, a rule-of-thumb was to shorten this to {{code|GO}}. This is the equivalent of {{code|RUN}} in BASIC. {{code|GOTO}} can also be used in the editor to start execution at a specified line.\n\n====Editing commands====\nNew lines are entered into the program by simply beginning the command with a line number.  The editing commands were ERASE (abbreviation E),{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} MODIFY (abbreviation M){{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.8}} and WRITE (abbreviation W):{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n* {{code|ERASE}} - zeroes out all variables. this is sometimes found within programs to reset them\n* {{code|ERASE <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - deletes the statement at the specified line\n* {{code|ERASE <nowiki><group number></nowiki>}} - deletes all statements in the specified group\n* {{code|ERASE ALL}} - deletes the entire program\n* {{code|MODIFY <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - allows the programmer to edit the specified line\n* {{code|WRITE <nowiki><line number></nowiki>}} - display the statement at the specified line\n* {{code|WRITE <nowiki><group number></nowiki>}} - display all statements in the specified group\n* {{code|WRITE ALL}} - display the specified program\n\n====File commands====\nThe file command was OPEN (abbreviation O):\n* {{code|OPEN INPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to read from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN OUTPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to write from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE INPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume input\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE OUTPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume output\n* {{code|OUTPUT CLOSE}} - output the buffer and close the file\n\n====Library commands====\nFOCAL included the ability to manage collections of FOCAL programs as a code library. Programs could call other programs in a chain fashion using {{code|LIBRARY CALL}}, or call a single subroutine in another program using {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB}}. Program names could be six characters long. The LIBRARY command (abbreviation L) had the following sub-commands:\n\n* {{code|LIBRARY DELETE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - delete a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY LIST [device:][file name]}} - catalog\n* {{code|LIBRARY RUN [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [line number]}} - chain the program, optionally resuming at the specified line number\n* {{code|LIBRARY SAVE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - save the program\n* {{code|LIBRARY EXIT}} - return to the PDP-8 monitor program\nFOCAL-71 added:\n* {{code|LIBRARY CALL [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - load a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [group number]}} - call a subroutine in an external program\n\n==Error codes==\nSince the interpreter lacked sufficient memory space to store error messages, or even a table of error numbers, FOCAL used a workaround by reporting the address of the error-detecting code as a fixed-point number. For example, the [[division by zero]] error was detected it would report {{code|?28.73 @ 01.10}}, where 28.73 represents the code checking for this error at memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words, and 01.10 is the line number where the error occurred. Pages in the PDP-8 were 128 bytes long, so this address translates to location 3657.\n\n==Changes between versions==\nDEC released three versions of FOCAL for the PDP-8 series, the original, known simply as FOCAL, and two updated versions, \nFOCAL,1969 and FOCAL,1971. FOCAL,1969 was largely identical to the original, but FOCAL,1971 was major update that added file handling, new mathematics, and a variety of other changes. In contrast to the first two versions, which were stand-alone systems, FOCAL,1971 was based on the emerging [[OS/8]] (then still known as PS/8) and relied more heavily on that operating system for file handling and editing.\n\n===FOCAL,1971===\nOne change in the new version was a 10-digit math package for added precision. The {{code|FSGN}} function now returned zero if the input expression evaluated to zero. Previously this would return one. The {{code|FRAN}} now used a better algorithm that produced more randomly distributed numbers. It also added the new {{code|FIN}} function that took a string and returned its [[ASCII]] value (akin to BASIC's {{code|ASC}}) and {{code|FOUT}} which took a number and returned a string with that ASCII character ({{code|CHR}}.\n\nAs all of these options used up limited memory, when started, FOCAL,1971 entered a dialog that asked the user what features they wanted to use.\n\n==Comparison with JOSS==\nFOCUL is, for all intents, a cleaned-up version of JOSS with changes to make the syntax terser and easier to parse. Almost all FOCAL commands have a one-to-one correspondence with JOSS and differ only in details. A few features of JOSS were missing in FOCAL.\n\nOne major difference is that JOSS included a complete set of comparison operations and a [[boolean logic]] system that operated within if and for constructs. Furthermore, the ifs and loops could be applied to any statement, in contrast to FOCAL, where the only operation either could carry out was the equivalent to a goto. For instance, in JOSS, one could:\n\n  1.10 Type A if X>10.\n  1.20 Type i for i=1(1)10.\n\nWhich would optionally print A based on the test, and then print the numbers 1 to 10. In contrast, FOCAL lacked the ability to compare values, and loops were applied by skipping to the next line when they completed. The equivalent code in FOCAL would be:\n\n 1.10 IF (X-10) ,,1.30\n 1.20 TYPE A!\n 1.30 FOR I=1,1,10;TYPE I,!\n\nJOSS' implementation makes common constructs easier to build and more closely match the programmer's intentions, at the cost of making the runtime more complex. For instance, JOSS allowed ranges in loops to be described in a flexible fashion, for instance, 1,2,3,10(5)50,75,78. This flexibility comes at a cost; in FOCAL the start, stop and step can be written down in a custom in-memory structure and easily updated as the loop is performed. In contrast, the JOSS system requires a pointer to what might be, but often isn't, a more complex expression that has to be stepped over with more complex parsing code.\n\nIn terms of making the code terser, changes were relatively minor. For instance, JOSS' {{code|Do part 20.}} becomes the slightly smaller FOCAL {{code|DO 20}}, while {{code|Do step 20.1}} becomes {{code|DO 20.1}}. Command keywords were also shortened where possible, so JOSS' {{code|Demand}} becomes FOCAL's {{code|ASK}}, both to make it shorter as well as allow the letter D to be uniquely used for {{code|DO}}. The period needed to indicate the end of a line in JOSS was removed.\n\nTo simplify the parser, some FOCAL options were removed. For instance, JOSS could perform multiple assignments with {{code|Set S{{=}}P, P{{=}}Q, Q{{=}}S.}} while in FOCAL these had to be made individual statements, {{code|SET S{{=}}P; SET P{{=}}Q; SET Q{{=}}S}}. Likewise, JOSS' {{code|Form}}, used to format output, was combined into FOCAL's {{code|TYPE}} with the {{code|%}}.\n\n==Comparison with BASIC==\nComparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were inevitable since both languages were common on [[minicomputer]]s of the same era, and the two languages have much in common in terms of syntax and structure. In most cases, there is a direct conversion of FOCAL code to and from BASIC. For instance, to ask the user to input a value, in FOCAL one would:\n\n  ASK \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nwhile in BASIC the equivalent is:\n\n  INPUT \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nWith the exception of a few features that were missing from one or the other, and some relatively minor differences in syntax, the two languages are very similar.\n\nOne notable exception is the {{code|IF}} in BASIC, which allowed any statement to be placed after the {{code|THEN}}, making it more similar with JOSS' control structures. BASIC reversed the ordering of the code compared to JOSS, placing the conditional expression at the start of the line rather than the end; in BASIC one uses {{code|IF this THEN that}} as opposed to {{code|that IF this}} in JOSS. BASIC's version has the advantage that the runtime could immediately abort reading the rest of the statement if the expression was not true. In contrast, FOCAL's {{code|IF}} was more like BASIC's [[computed goto]], {{code|ON X GOTO 10,20,30}}, but the {{code|ON...GOTO}} allowed any number of lines as targets, as opposed to only three for negative, zero and positive as in JOSS and FOCAL.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that FOCAL lacked inherent support for [[string (computer science)|strings]] as data elements that could be assigned to variables. As was the case in early BASICs or FORTRAN versions before the addition of strings (in F77), this limitation was generally avoided through the use of literal strings in input and output commands. It was only when one had to manipulate individual strings or characters within them that this became a significant problem.\n\nAs string variables were not supported, inputting a string used a [[kludge]] that converted any characters typed in by the user to their numeric character value. For example, if one typed \"HELLO\" at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to \"8\", the numeric value of \"H\" in the PDP-8's [[six-bit character code]]s (\"H\" is the eighth letter). It would then interpret the \"E\" as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute \"8\" to the \"LLO\" power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a particularly helpful response. Nevertheless, by asking questions that would be responded to using single-letter responses, like {{code|Do you need instructions, Y or N\"}}, programmers could test the result against known character values to produce what looked like character input.\n\nFOCAL's PDP-8 implementation used a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] representation that represented numbers as four 12-bit words, forty-eight bits in total, with thirty-six bits of mantissa and twelve bits of exponent. This allowed for both significantly higher precision and a significantly wider range of values than most contemporary interpreters, making FOCAL a reasonable choice for serious numerical work. This high precision, and good choices for default decimal output formatting, meant that difficulties with binary-to-decimal rounding were not evident to beginning users. For comparison, [[Microsoft BASIC]] initially used a [[Microsoft Binary Format|32-bit format]], while later versions expanded this to 40-bits. Most BASICs had problems with rounding that led to simple equations resulting in tiny non-zero remainders.\n\nIt is generally agreed that FOCAL was more efficient in its use of resources than comparable BASIC systems. On a typical machine of the day, often with 6 to 24 kilobytes of [[magnetic-core memory]], FOCAL could handle larger and more complex programming tasks than BASIC.\n\n== Versions and spinoffs ==\nThe Coca-Cola Corporation used a customized version of FOCAL called COKE.\n\nFOCAL was later implemented on the PDP-7, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, PDP-5 and LINC-8.\n\nThe FOCAL manual showed how to add commands to the FOCAL parser, so many sites added specialized commands for operating custom hardware.\n\nThe [[DECUS|Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society]] collected many patches and enhancements for FOCAL. There were even major enhanced offshoots of FOCAL, such as FOCAL-W, which added many features, including better mass storage file I/O and even virtual variable memory.\n\nIn [[Russia]], it saw use as late as the early 1990s in mass-produced home computers of the [[Electronika BK]] series.\n\n==Example code==\nThe original Lunar Lander makes an excellent example for examining FOCAL code, as it uses most of the features of the language.

This was almost universal in FOCAL programs (and JOSS), as the line number scheme made such constructs easy to use. This program uses nine routines. The first, group 1, simply prints out the instructions using the {{code|T}}ype statement and sets the initial values for the run. The mass of fuel is not recorded directly, instead, it uses the current {{code|M}}ass and empty mass, {{code|N}}, so the remaining fuel is M-N and the lander runs out of fuel when M-N is 0. Also note the {{code|E}}rase at the end of line 1.20, which resets all the variable values.\n\nThe main game loop is driven by group 2. As the code \"falls\" through group 1 into group 2 during the first run, the initial values are printed out in the first two lines. Near the end of line 2.20, the user is {{code|A}}sked to input the burn rate as {{code|K}}, and then the loop timer is reset using {{code|S T{{=}}10}}. Line 2.70 tests the user's input against several possibilities, if it is over 200 or below 8 it types \"NOT POSSIBLE\" and a row of periods, and then loops back to ask the user to try again. If the value is between these values, it jumps forward to group 3. Note that the limited capabilities of FOCAL's {{code|IF}} command are evident here, in BASIC this could be reduced to a single {{code|IF K>200 OR K<8 THEN...}}\n\nGroup 3 first tests to see if the fuel has run out, and jumps to group 4 if it has. Then it tests if the 10-second period in {{code|T}} has expired and, if so, loops back to print everything out again, which has the side-effect of resetting T and S to 10. Line 3.40 tests to see if the amount of fuel burned this period, S*K, will reduce the mass of the vehicle as a whole, S*K-M, beyond the empty weight, N. If not, it moves on, if it will, it instead sets the loop timer to the amount of time the remaining fuel will burn, thus ending the loop early. In either case, it calls group 9 to update the velocity and position. It then loops over groups 7, 8 and 9 until the value of I converges.\n\nWhen the 10-second timer runs out, or it reaches the end due to the fuel test in line 3.10 or the altitude test in 7.10. In the latter cases, it will jump to group 4 and fall through to group 5, or jump to group 5 directly. Group 5 types the end-of-game results and then asks the user if they'd like to try again. If so, it jumps to 1.20 to clear out all values and print the headers again, if not if falls through to 5.98 and {{code|Q}}uits.\n\n==See also==\n*[[JOSS]], the Rand language that inspired FOCAL\n*[[MUMPS]], a data-manipulation language based on JOSS and FOCAL concepts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n |title=FOCAL Programming Manual \n |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation \n |date=1968 \n |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-08-AJAB-D%20PDP-8-I%20FOCAL%20Programming%20Manual.pdf \n|ref=CITEREFManual1968\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/216469/A_basic_history_of_BASIC_on_its_50th_birthday.php\n |title=A basic history of BASIC on its 50th birthday\n |website=Gamasutra\n |date=1 May 2014\n |first=John |last=Szczepaniak\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite interview\n |first=Kevin |last=Savetz\n |date=April 2013\n |title=Dave Ahl and Betsy Ahl\n |url=https://computingpioneers.com/index.php?title=Dave_Ahl_and_Betsy_Ahl\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[ftp://ftp.pdp8.net/software/games/focal/ FOCAL source code], FOCAL source for several programs, including Lunar Lander, Sumer Game, and others\n*[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/ DEC's FOCAL 1969 Promotional Booklet]\n*[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ The Computer History Simulation Project (Focal is available as a free download here)]\n*ftp://www.cozx.com/pub/langs/focal.tar.gz C-source version that runs under several operating systems, including Linux\n*[http://www.catb.org/retro the C-source for a modern DOS version suitable for teaching]  \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525101809/http://www.libex.ru/detail/book91959.html Abramov V.A.

Meyers, the ability to make a story seem more unfamiliar and exotic,  and an alien seem less of a costumed human who merely differs in physical appearance, is only possible through the use of language <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=8 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/8 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. It is this ability that appears to draw the boundary between great works of science fiction and those lesser so. As such, Linguistics, the scientific study of language, comes to hold an important role in the genre of science fiction.\n\n== History of Linguistics in Science Fiction ==\n\n== Alien Communication ==\n\nWhen dealing with alien languages, the general practice for science fiction, as described by Meyers, was to \u201cmine earlier stories for themes and approaches, frequently making references to what they regard as flaws or virtues in the works of their predecessors\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=96 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>. As such, it is common for science fiction works to be inspired by one another in terms of linguistics endeavours.\n\nTo have alien language involved in works of science fiction, there has to be contact between humans and extraterrestrial life forms. This is argued by Meyers to be a \u201cstaple\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=86 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> of science fiction. Despite the linguistic nature of such a task, Meyers laments that \u201cthe job of a linguist is handled by some other specialist\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=87 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> and in the works he examined, the characters seem to have no qualms with such a choice. There are several works of science fiction that have professionals with no linguistic training to undertake the attempts at communication with aliens. Such examples include professionals like  astronomers, geologists and poets. To some of these choices, Meyers suggests that the success of science fiction communications \u201cmight be the result of sheer good luck\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=88 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> for characters are often unfamiliar not only with the alien language they are faced, but linguistics as a whole.\n\nIn science fiction, the success in communication with extraterrestrial life forms often involve no attempt at solving the issue of the language barrier between the human characters and the alien characters. Meyers expresses his distaste for such writing in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' with:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cOne does not resolve a contradiction by asserting it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\" />\n}}\n\nGenerally, science fiction authors still use such a non-method. One such example is the translation circuit built into the TARDIS (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]) that automatically resolves any language barrier characters face in their space travel.\n\nAt the same time, science fiction is not completely devoid of attempts at solving the issue of language barriers between the different species of science fiction.\n\nIn ''Tetrahedra of Space'', author [[P. Schuyler Miller]] employs sign language as a means of communication between aliens and humans. This is, however, not before having considered other methods such as drawings. A notable attempt from the novel is that the human in the story draws a diagram of the solar system to explain to the alien its heliocentric nature. This method is susceptible to the [[arbitrariness]] of images. This is similar to the criticisms often applied to the [[Pioneer plaque]] by [[Frank Drake]] and [[Carl Sagan]] placed onboard the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft. The diagram in the story, much like the diagrams on the Pioneer plaque, can be easily misunderstood by any nonhuman life form that comes across it. In short, the strategy of using images to communicate with aliens in science fiction is not linguistically robust.\n\nAnother point of discussion brought up by Meyers is the question of whether or not aliens even have the sense of sight. The strategy of using images to communicate with aliens would not even be possible, regardless of its arbitrariness if the intended recipient is not even capable of seeing it. For example in ''Old Faithful'' by [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], a Martian astronomer detects a morse code message from Earth. Unfortunately for the Martian, not only can he not understand the message, he is deaf and mute and is therefore unfamiliar with the concept that sounds are put together to represent meanings in human language, nor that these strings of sound are represented by an [[orthography]] that can be encoded into signals. Throughout the book, Gallun made the Martian learn the messages he receives from Earth despite his disability.\n\nIn ''[[Swords of Mars]]'' of the [[Barsoom]] series, an example praised by Meyers, author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] documented a method with which his alien character uses to learn human language that is similar to that used by linguists. In one of the books, the alien character ignores the attempts of communication made by a human character for being too ambiguous. Instead, he points to things in his surroundings and asks the human for a name. This way, he slowly learns some words in English. \n\nIn ''The Winds of Time'' by [[Chad Oliver]], Oliver not only addressed the issue of there being language barrier but also described a method similar to those a linguist might employ when trying to document an unfamiliar language. The alien even goes on to look for [[minimal pairs]] and with his findings, builds an alien equivalent of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). The alien also learns human languages other than English, the majority language of where his ship landed. Oliver, however, glossed over the [[morphology (linguistics)]] and [[syntax]] part of learning a language and chose to summarise the entire process instead. Overall, Meyers praised this book as having \u201c[set] a high standard of excellence for the use of linguistics\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=100 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>.\n\nThe minority of its kind, ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by [[Ted Chiang]]  actually has a linguist attempt communication with an alien species that entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The linguistic concept used in the  novella, however, was the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The novella is the source material for the 2016 film, ''[[Arrival (film)]]''.\n\n== Deciphering Languages ==\n\nThe concept of unknown languages appears as a recurring theme in many science fiction books that contain alien languages. In some science fiction works, the deciphering of these unknown languages by protagonists of the story follow the linguistic method similar to that used in the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts using the [[Rosetta stone]]. This method involves comparing between translations of the same text, where at least one translation is in a known text. \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...to decipher a dead language one must have some way of getting into the circle, of finding a connection between something inside the system and something outside it.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=39 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/39 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis method can be seen in science fiction works such as [[Arrival (film)]] in which a part of the deciphering process involved acquiring translations of English sentences in the alien language to compare and decipher meanings. Another method used in the movie was learning the language one word at a time, see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]. This is not a recent phenomenon in science fiction, with such ideas appearing even earlier such as in ''[[This Perfect Day]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]. In the story, the world is unified under an oppressive rule with only one language. The protagonist, a nonconformist, later finds books in other foreign languages and attempts to decipher them with limited success, until he finds a book (in French)  with an essay by the founder of the unified world, an essay which already has a translated version available to him in the language he knows. This, in the same way as the Rosetta Stone helps him decipher the language (French). Some other works involve lesser accidental Rosetta Stones but rather deliberate clues with the explicit intention of helping future populations decipher the language. In such cases, since there is no way of knowing what future communication is like, there is preference to use illustrations and other instructional material to help future populations learn the unknown language. Such methods can be found in works such as The Retreat to Mars by Cecil B. White. \n\nOther works of science fiction involving language decipherment are ''[https://www.unz.com/print/ThrillingWonder-1943aug-00049 Expedition]'' by [[Anthony Boucher]] , ''Resurrection/[[The Monster (short story)]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]], ''[[Surface Tension (short story)]]'' by [[James Blish]], ''[[The Star (Clarke short story)|The Star]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and ''[[Omnilingual]]'' by [[H. Beam Piper]].\n\nWorks that contain more futile efforts of the decipherment of unknown languages include ''The Pastel City'' ([[Viriconium]] Book 1), ''No Jokes on Mars'' by [[James Blish]], and ''Patron of the Arts'' by [[William Rotsler]].\n\n== Language Change ==\n\nScience fiction highlights the common knowledge about language change, which most writers demonstrated to be very little. \n\n=== Historical Change ===\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cScience fiction as a genre, then, has a special relationship within the field of language within the field of language studies to historical linguistics.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/12 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, science fiction is the only genre that enables writers to either foresee the future of the language or the older forms of language, depending on the context of the story <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />. Despite this, many authors failed to realise the importance of linguistics in science fiction, even those with good knowledge of the field. As noted by [[John Krueger]]: \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...in perhaps one-third or thereabouts of s-f stories, problems of language and communication raise their head, though not always playing a major role.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />\n}}\n\nOne example of this can be viewed in the portrayal of [[historical linguistics]]. Historical linguistics entails the study of the older forms of language, and unfortunately, has been one of the lowest priorities in accuracy for science-fiction authors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/15 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. In some instances linguistic facts were disregarded such as in [[Harvey Jacobs]]\u2019s ''The Egg of the Glak'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=Harvey |title=The Egg of the Glak |url=https://epdf.pub/harvey-jacobs-the-egg-of-the-glak.html |website=epdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where the [[Great Vowel Shift]] was said to be caused by the [[Norman Conquest]]. In other instances, linguistic changes were misinterpreted such as in [[Larry Niven]]\u2019s ''The Fourth Profession'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/16 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there are authors who have employed linguistic change in their works fairly well. [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], for instance, conducted extensive research on the forms of English in different historical periods for his series ''[[Riverworld]]'', resulting in consistent accuracies with language change in English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIn general the treatment of linguistic change in science fiction is like the sky on a hazy night: a few bright spots seen through an obfuscating fog.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=18 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/18 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Evolutionary Change ===\n\nScience fiction authors have had differing views on how language will change in the future. Some believe English will become incomprehensible such as in  [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[The Time Machine]]''. Others hypothesize English will be influenced by other languages, as seen in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]]. There are, however, science fiction authors who choose neither and proclaim English as the \u201cinterstellar lingua franca as it had on Earth\u201d such as in [[Robert Silverberg]]\u2019s ''Schwartz Between the Galaxies'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Schwartz between the galaxies |url=https://archive.org/details/feastofstdionysu0000silv/page/n1 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=1 April 2020 |pages=79-104}}</ref>and in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which English is spoken by everyone. In his ''Visions of Tomorrow'', David Samuelson noted that many science-fiction authors prefer English as the universal spoken language in their stories <ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuelson |first1=David |title=Visions of Tomorrow |date=1975 |publisher=New York: Arno Press |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12296108?q&versionId=26107964 |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. For written English on the other hand, many science-fiction authors perceive a bleak future. This is seen in works such as [[Walter Miller, Jr.]]\u2019s ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', in which the people are reduced to illiteracy due to nuclear war. In [[Algis Budrys]]\u2019s ''For Love'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Budrys |first1=Algis |title=For Love |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n05_1962-06#page/n9/mode/2up |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, it is not nuclear war but rather alien invasion that causes this. In other works such as [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]'' and [[Robert Sheckley]]\u2019s ''Mindswap'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheckley |first1=Robert |title=Mindswap |url=https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v23n05_1965-06/page/n7/mode/2up/search/mindswap |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, written English is not completely wiped out but instead reduced to basic English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cmost science fiction writers have \u2026. the habit of being extremely slipshod about language\u2026 The time travelers hop three thousand years into the future and find people still speaking idiomatic New York English. (How many people today speak any language that was used in 1000 B.C.?)\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=22 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/22 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs from the quote by [[Fletcher Pratt]], the future of the language appears to be a topic brushed over by some science-fiction writers, where time-travellers into the future still find themselves being able to communicate perfectly in the same English regardless of the year from which the characters originate. [[Glottochronology]] assumes that a certain amount of basic words in a language will be lost after a thousand years and subsequently <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gudschinsky |first1=Sarah C. |title=The ABC'S of Lexicostatistics (Glottochronology) |journal=WORD |date=August 1956 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=175-210 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>. This would mean that the language as we know it now would not be fully similar in the far future. Certain writers believed sound recordings would hinder language change, as seen in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=27 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/27 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>.  \n\nHowever, not all writers give a lacklustre effort into the future of the language. Science-fiction writers mostly use two methods to demonstrate English of the future: some difference in pronunciation, and the insertion of a few words <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/29 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. The former can be seen in [[Bruce McAllister]]\u2019s ''Benji\u2019s Pencil'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=McAllister |first1=Bruce |title=Benji's Pencil |url=https://archive.org/stream/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF/Fantasy__Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF_djvu.txt |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where English is described as sounding like \u201cnasalised English, chopped but softer than German\u201d 200 years into the future. The inclusion of new words comprise of either forming new words, such as \u201cgoffin\u201d  in [[James Blish]]\u2019s ''[[A Work of Art]]'', or using old words in a new sense such as in [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''The Star Pit'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Samuel R. |title=The Star Pit |url=https://archive.org/details/samuelrdelanythestarpit04/Samuel_R_Delany-The_Star_Pit-01+WBAI.mp3 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, in which the word \u201cgolden\u201d is used as a term referring to the only ones capable of withstanding the mental stress of piloting an intergalactic craft. \n\nSuch assumptions on the evolution of language in science fiction might be helpful in predicting the future of language in reality as seen in an undertaking by Peter Stockwell <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stockwell |first1=Peter |title=Futuretalk: one small step towards a Chronolinguistics |journal=Nottingham Linguistic Circular |date=2000 |volume=15 |pages=55-68}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, all in all, the state of language change in science fiction may be summarized well by the following excerpt from ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' by Walter E. Meyers <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=36-37 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/36 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...science fiction is a window not into the future but into the present: in its stories we see what the writers know about language in general and historical linguistics in particular.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\" />\n}}\n\n== Learning Alien Language ==\n\n== Language Medium ==\n\nWith invented species, aliens, and other such characters in science fiction comes not only constructed languages but also new mediums using which these characters speak. As Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the science fiction writer frequently invents both the message and the medium.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=69 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=10 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Auditory (Sound)===\n\nA common medium of communication employed by science fiction authors, however, is the familiar one of vocal-auditory used by humans. In order to make this more exotic and suited to the alien theme of the story, some writers choose to tweak the method of producing this medium of communication. This could come in the form of a difference in physiology or structure of the alien as seen in [[Isaac Asimov]]\u2019s ''[[Hostess]]''. In his story, Asimov\u2019s alien is described as having a different mouth structure to a human, although his speech sounds similar to that of a human on Earth:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe construction of his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors , gave a whistling sound to the sibilants. Aside from that, he might have been born on Earth for all the accent his speech showed.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=The Complete Stories |date=1951 |page=354}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Gordon R. Dickson]] describes just as much in his work ''The Christmas Present'' (see: [[The Star Road]]), with the jellyfish-like alien described as having a voice that was:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...croaky and unbeautiful, for a constricted air-sac is not built for the manufacture of human words.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dickson |first1=Gordon R. |title=The Christmas Present |date=1973 |page=83}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[John Brunner]] also goes into detail about the method of sound production of his aliens in his work ''The Dramaturges of Yan'', writing that the aliens had lungs at their sides,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...drawing in air directly through spiracles between the ribs; like bagpipes, they had continual through-put. Sound to talk with was generated by a tympanal membrane and relayed through resonating chambers in the gullet, giving a rather pleasant, if not monotonous, timbre; in Kaydad\u2019s case, resembling a cello droning away on a single note\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunner |first1=John |title=The Dramaturges of Yan |date=1972 |page=44}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] uses a rather different method from these in his work ''Friend to Man'' (see: ''[[The Explorers (collection)]]''), in which the alien resembles a cello in the way it produces sound and not just in the way it sounds. This method of producing sound is described in the following excerpt of an interaction between the alien and a man named Smith who was rescued by the alien:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\"Salt?\" asked Smith, his voice thin in the thin air. \u201cI need salt with water.\u201d\nThe thing rubbed two appendages together and he saw a drop of amber exude and spread on them. It was, he realised a moment later, rosining the bow, for the appendages drew across each other and he heard a whining, vibrating cricket voice say: \u201cS-s-z-z-aw-w?\u201d\nIt did better the next time. The amber drop spread, and \u201cS-z-aw-t?\u201d was sounded, with a little tap of the bow for the final phoneme.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kornbluth |first1=Cyril M. |title=Friend to Man |date=1951 |page=243}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis theme of aliens producing sound in a way similar to a musical instrument (and perhaps physically resembling one as well) is continued by [[James Blish]] in his work ''This Earth of Hours''. In the story, the aliens are known as \u201cCall\u00ebans\u201d and the character, 12-UpJohn, discovers how they spoke, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the sounds issued at low volume from a multitude of spiracles or breath-holes all along the body, each hole producing only one pure tone, the words and intonations being formed in mid-air by intermodulation - a miracle of co-ordination among a multitude of  organs obviously unsuitable for sound-forming at all.\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blish |first1=James |title=This Earth of Hours |journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |date=June 1959 |page=12}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe theme of musical communication has appeared in science fiction as early as 1638 in [[Francis Godwin]]\u2019s work ''[[The Man in the Moone]]''. It also appeared in [[Winfred P. Lehmann]]\u2019s ''Decoding of the Martian Language''. Since W. P. Lehmann is a linguist, his story was explained in far greater scientific detail than most other science fiction authors.\n\nWhen it comes to the auditory medium, however, there is also communication at frequencies above and below that of what is audible to humans. For example, in [[Henry Kuttner]]\u2019s ''The Big Night'', the aliens communicate using frequencies below what is audible to humans (subsonics) and wears a device to increase this frequency to one that is audible to humans when communicating with them. In ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'' by [[Hal Clement]], the alien is able to communicate in both a frequency higher than what is perceived by humans and a frequency perceivable by humans. The aliens in ''[[In a Good Cause\u2014]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] had similar abilities, having a specialised organ for the higher frequencies and a separate one for frequencies audible to humans. \n\nMore science fiction stories involving the vocal-auditory medium as a means of communication include ''[[Proxima Centauri (short story)]]'' by [[Murray Leinster]], ''[[Arrival (film)]]'' (although the aliens in ''Arrival'' had two mediums of communication, one vocal-auditory and the other through visuals), and even the aliens present in ''[[Star Trek]]''.\n\n=== Visual (Sight) ===\n\nSecond most popular choice of language medium in science fiction is the visual medium or sight. One such story using this medium is ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]'' by Kilgore Trout ([[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]), in which the aliens used their limbs to make signs in order to communicate:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\u201cWhat do they talk with?\u201d Simon said to Chworktap.\n\t\u201cThey use their fingers, just like deaf-and-dumb people.\u201d\n\u2026 Their arms came out, the fingers wriggling and crossing and bending as they asked each other what in the hell these strangers were and what did they mean to do?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Philip Jos\u00e9 |title=Venus on the Half-Shell |date=1975 |page=101}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[James Blish]] also explored the use of visual medium in communication in his work ''VOR''. In the story, the alien communicated using colour-shifts in the light spectrum (displayed colours on in the front of its head). Similar to this was the aliens in [[Rex Gordon]]\u2019s ''First on Mars/[[No Man Friday]]'', in which the aliens (as big as freight trains) also communicated using light with the main character saying \u201c...there simply has not been on Earth such a colloquy of light.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Rex |title=No Man Friday |date=1956 |page=158}}</ref>. In ''[[What Is This Thing Called Love? (short story)]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], the aliens also communicated through colour, using color patches that changed hue to communicate. In ''Death and Designation Among the Asadi'' by [[Michael Bishop (author)]], Bishop describes in detail a similar form of communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAs for the staring matches, they\u2019re of brief duration and involve fierce gesticulation and mane-shaking. In these head-to-head confrontations the eyes change colour with astonishing rapidity, flashing through the entire visible spectrum -and maybe beyond- in a matter of seconds.\n\tI am now prepared to say that these instantaneous changes of eye color are the Asadi equivalent of speech\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Michael |title=Death and Designation Among the Asadi |date=January 1973 |page=175}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Olfactory (Smell)===\n\nAlthough much more challenging to employ, smell has also been used as a medium of communication by science fiction authors. In ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]], the aliens (T\u2019worlies) communicate through smells. As noticed by a human character in the story, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe vinegary smell deepened.It was a sign of polite cogitation in a T\u2019worlie, like a human being\u2019s hmmm\u201d <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=42}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSimilar to this method of communication is the alien species in ''Cabin Boy'' (see ''[[Far Out (book)]]'') by [[Damon Knight]]. In this story, two humans attempt to communicate with the alien that uses scent, although this proves rather difficult:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there had been a series of separate odors, all unfamiliar and all overpoweringly strong. At least a dozen of them, Roget thought; they had gone past too quickly to count.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Damon |title=Far Out |date=1951 |chapter=Cabin Boy}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs Meyers points out, however, the challenge in \u201c...using air-borne scents for communication is that even a casual breeze becomes \u201cnoise\u201d in the system, blending odors and distorting their original sequence.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=80 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>. Then again, [[Colin Kapp]] overcomes this problem in his work ''The Old King\u2019s Answers'', in which the one character describes the aliens as having:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...scent glands in the pads of their feet\u2026 They\u2019ve settled on the flat faces of the crystal rocks when they really want to leave a message for the world.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\">{{cite book |last1=Kapp |first1=Colin |title=The Old King's Answers |date=1973 |page=167}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe character further goes on to explain:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cUsing chromatography, I\u2019ve managed to identify three individual scent products, all of them remarkably persistent. They are combined together on the crystal faces in an amazing spectrum of complexity. In their scent-writing they have the capacity -though I\u2019m not sure how much of it they utilize- to compress more bits of information in a given space than we humans can in our optical writing.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\" />\n}}\n\nThis medium of smell was also utilised by [[John Norman]] [LINK] in his work ''Priest-Kings of Gor'' (Book 3 of ''[[Gor]]''), in which the medium is not only described but the advantages and disadvantages of it is also discussed. In the story, the narrator describes the medium, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cWhat in the passageways I had taken to be the scent of Priest-Kings had actually been the residue of odor-signals which Priest-Kings, like certain social insects of our world, use in communicating with one another.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=77}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe narrator then goes on to discuss in length the advantageous and disadvantageous of such a medium:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cCommunication by odor-signals can in certain circumstances be extremely efficient, though it can be disadvantageous in others. For example, an odor can carry\u2026 much farther than can the shout or cry of a man to another man. Moreover, if not too much time is allowed to elapse, a Priest-King may leave a message in his chamber or in a corridor for another Priest-King, and the other may arrive later and interpret. A disadvantage of this mode of communication, of course, is that the message may be understood by strangers or by others for whom it is not intended. One must be careful of what one says in the tunnels of the Priest-Kings for one\u2019s words may linger after one, until they sufficiently dissipate to be little more than a meaningless blur of scent.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=78}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince, Norman placed his setting in \u201ctunnels\u201d, he rid himself of any problems posed by winds. A similar approach was taken by [[Hal Clement]] in his work ''[[Uncommon Sense]]'', in which he had gotten rid of air altogether by assuming his setting to be an airless planet.\n\n=== Kinesics (Movement/Gestures)===\n\nAs explained by Meyers, gestures\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...are as arbitrary in their meanings as any spoken word: they depend for their intelligibility on the prior agreement by the members of the community.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=82 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis code-like aspect of gestures is seen in science fiction stories involving [[kinesics]] as a medium for language. One such example of this is seen in ''Orn'' (Book 2 of ''[[Of Man and Manta]]'') by [[Piers Anthony]]. In this story, \u201cmanta-shaped flying fungoids\u201d used kinesics for communication in that they snapped their tails once for \u2018yes\u2019 and twice for \u2018no\u2019 when communicating with humans. This code eventually evolved and allowed the fungoids to initiate conversation \u201cwith that combination of gesture and tail snaps they had gradually worked out as their code\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=Piers |title=Orn |date=1970 |page=147}}</ref>.\n\nIn some cases, however, kinesics was not employed as a medium of communication on its own but together with other mediums. For example, in ''The Dance of the Changer and the Three'' by [[Terry Carr]], the aliens called Loarrans communicated via \u201cwave-dancing\u201d and seemed in part an artform rather than just communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe dance he went through to give the description was intricate and even imaginative\u2026 It used motion and color and sound and another sense something like smell.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Terry |title=The Dance of the Changer and the Three |date=1968}}</ref> \n}}\n\nIn the case of the Nildoror, aliens in ''[[Downward to the Earth]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], they had no limbs that they were able to use to gesture (having walked on all fours). Hence, they had other appendages to do so. As the narrator explains:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe spiny crest down the middle of the alien\u2019s broad skull began to twitch\u2026 The nildoror had a rich language of gesture, employing not only the spines but also their long ropy trunks and their many-pleated ears,\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Downward to the Earth |date=1970 |pages=8-9}}</ref>  \n}}\n\nThere are also some science fiction works that include tactile ([[touch]]) as a medium of communication. These include works such as ''[[Memoirs of a Spacewoman]]'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\n== Machines & Language ==\n\n=== Machine Speech ===\n\nMachines have been another popular theme in science fiction works, appearing in works like ''[[I, Robot (film)]]'', ''[[Ex Machina (film)]]'' , ''[[Chappie (film)]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even much older works such as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. In such works, machines are portrayed with the ability to speak just as well or even better than humans. This ability is almost always explained from the perspective of computer programming as was done in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'', although it has just as much to do with linguistics, especially in order to sound natural enough to be indistinguishable from a regular human. \n\n[[Speech synthesis]] occurring in science fiction works can be categorised into two forms. The first form is synthesised speech, which is completely produced by the machine itself and is the form of speech synthesis portrayed by Robert A. Heinlein in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress''. The second form appearing in science fiction works is one in which stored pre-recorded bits of human speech are assembled by the machine to form speech <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/45/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>. This form of machine-generated speech appeared in works such as ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] in which speech produced by the machine was void of any intonations or other prosody. \n\nIn more recent works, such as ''I, Robot'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', machines are portrayed as having speech that sounds just as natural as that of a regular human. In ''The Machine'' by [[John W. Campbell]] (from ''The Best of John W. Campbell''), the machine-produced voice was described as being \u201c...peculiarly commanding, a superhuman voice of perfect clarity and perfect resonance. It was commanding, attracting, yet pleasant.\u201d. This manner of human-like speech can also be seen in ''You\u2019ll take the High Road'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] (from ''Three Trips in Time and Space'') and ''[[Galactic Pot-Healer]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Ira Levin has also utilised the idea of fluent human-like speech in his science fiction work ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', in which human-like androids are made to replace mens\u2019 wives after they have been murdered by their husbands. The androids, needing to be perfect copies of the women, use machine-generated voices that gain their vocabulary from recordings of the women\u2019s actual voices.\n\nHowever, in many other works, machine speech was used to portray \u201chuman depersonalisation\u201d. In ''Promises to Keep: A Science Fiction Drama'' from ''Alien Horizons'' by [[William F. Nolan]], Nolan described the computerised ship\u2019s voice as \u201cmetallic, emotionless\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\" />. This portrayal could be traced back to even older works such as ''The Last Evolution'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=John W. Campbell, Jr. |title=The Last Evolution |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27462/27462-h/27462-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020 |archivedate=December 2008}}</ref> by John W. Campbell in which machine speech was described as\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the vibrationally correct, emotionless tones of all the race of machines.\u201d \n}}\n\nOther work involving this theme of depersonalisation includes works such as ''[[It's Such a Beautiful Day]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], ''[[The Quest for Saint Aquin]]'' by Anthony Boucher, ''The Hawks of Arcturus'' by Cecil Snyder, ''I, the Unspeakable'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Walter J. Sheldon |title=I, the Unspeakable |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51210 |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Walter J. Sheldon<ref>{{cite web |title=Walter J. Sheldon |url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Sheldon |website=Wikip\u00e9dia |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=French}}</ref>, and ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' by [[Anne McCaffrey]].\n\nGiven the scientific capabilities to add prosody to machine-generated speech, Walter E. Meyers was critical of this use of emotionless machine speech in science fiction works, as shown from the following excerpt:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the problems of adding pitch, stress, and juncture (the transitions between words and phrases) to machine-produced speech were mastered well before William F. Nolan wrote the passage\u2026 Writers who now speak of emotionless mechanical voices do so either through ignorance or, more probably, because they value the symbolism involved more highly than scientific accuracy.\u201d \n}}\n\nMore works utilising the general theme of machine speech are ''Jamboree'' by [[Jack Williamson]], ''Becalmed in Hell'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Larry Niven |title=Becalmed in Hell |url=https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781481483605/9781481483605___6.htm |website=Space Pioneers |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Larry Niven, ''Starchild'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]] (part of the ''[[Starchild Trilogy]]''), ''Evane (1973)'' by [[E.C. Tubb]], and ''Stranger Station'' by [[Damon Knight]].\n\n=== Automatic Translators ===\n\nIn many works of science fiction with language as part of the plot, the idea of automatic translators has been frequently brought up <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Alien and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=119 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/119/mode/2up |accessdate=6 April 2020 |chapter=8}}</ref>. These translators can be split into two main types: translators translating from a known language to another known language, and those translating from an unknown language to a known language. \n\nWalter E. Meyers noted that translators of the first kind (known-to-known) were usually small devices, \u201c...typically worn as a pendent or pinned to the shirt\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\" />. This can be seen in ''Jackal\u2019s Meal'' (collected in ''[[The Star Road]]'') by [[Gordon R. Dickson]]. Such a device also appeared in ''A Little Knowledge'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which a small device worn on the chest and called a \u2018Vocalizer\u2019 translated English into the known language of aliens. More works involving this type of automatic translators include ''The Brains of Earth'' by [[Jack Vance]].\n\nThe second type of translator (unknown-to-known) seems to appear more often in science fiction works and can be alternatively known as a \u201c[[Universal Translator]]\u201d. In ''I\u2019ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty'' by [[James Tiptree Jr.]], the protagonist uses a universal translator called the \u2018Omniglot Mark Eight Vocoder\u2019 that instantly translates whatever is being said to the necessary alien language although the characters themselves do not know what language that is. \n\nThe universal translator also makes multiple appearances in science fiction movies and shows. In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)]]'', a universal translator is introduced during the tour of the MIB headquarters, and in ''[[Star Trek]]'', a Universal Translator  is frequently used to translate alien languages into known languages of the user. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also played with the idea of a universal translator, with the universal translator being part of the Tardis. This recurring theme of universal translators being part of a ship or mode of transport was also seen in ''[[Ringworld]]'' by Larry Niven.\n\nContrary to this theme, works such as ''[[Inconstant Moon#\"How the Heroes Die\"|\"How the Heroes Die\"]]'' also by Larry Niven and ''Unhuman Sacrifice'' by [[Katherine Maclean]] portrayed the universal translator as a less portable, more fixed-in-place computer. Even further from this theme are works such as ''[[The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which the universal translator is not in the form of a machine at all. In ''The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy'', the universal translator exists instead as a \u2018babel fish\u2019 that is inserted into the ear.\n\n== Animals and Language ==\n\n== Telepathy ==\n\n[[Telepathy]] has been a recurring [[motif (narrative)]] in science fiction stories, for the most part being used as a convenient tool to bypass linguistic problems that writers encounter <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=131 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This is illustrated in [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923). In this science fiction story, telepathy is used in daily communications, although the accuracy of what is communicated differs from person to person, with thought being rephrased and reflected based on the receiver's linguistic ability. Wells, through his character's dialogue, directly mentions how convenient a solution telepathy is to linguistic problems such as  language barriers (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAnd all things considered, it is really very convenient for us that there should be this method of transmission. For otherwise, I do not see how we could have avoided weeks of linguistic bother, first principles of our respective grammars, logic, significs, and so forth, boring stuff for the most part, before we could have got to anything like our present understanding\u201d \n}} (Excerpt from ''Men like Gods'')\n\nHowever, while conveniently giving a solution to that linguistic issue, Wells form of telepathy seemed to create problems for other aspects of linguistics. Given that language change resulted from variations in speech, Walter E. Meyers suggested that this telepathy would result in an obstruction to language evolution (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Evolutionary Change|Evolutionary Change]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...a universal telepathic power would slow down, and perhaps even halt [language] change altogether, if (and this is an important condition) change in language results from normal but inevitable variation in speech forms\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=134-135 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAlthough affecting speech, telepathy would not isolate writing from changes, as illustrated by Burrough in his Martian novels, where Mars has several forms of written language despite having only one spoken language. \n\nAs noted by Walter E. Meyers, Wells use of telepathy implies that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...telepathy transmits linguistic constructions\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=136 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn doing so, however, differences between linguistic, lexical, and even cultural concepts of different language speakers would still hinder understanding between speakers using telepathy. The challenges presented by cultural barriers, for example, was presented in the work ''Prott'' by [[Margaret St. Clair]], in which a telepath laments that despite conducting 52 interviews with aliens named \u201cPrott\u201d he has been unable to learn much. As John W. Campbell pointed out in an editorial (see: [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]: Astounding, June 1941)\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cMost of our words have background references that we know so well we tend to overlook them.\u201d \n}}\n\nAs per this quote, these background references may be easily understood by speakers of a language but not to the rest. Paul A. Carter summarised this well when explaining that \u201c... in situations demanding discernment of the cultural context of words, there might be trouble.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=137 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>.\n\nGiven such a problem, some science-fiction writers suggested pictures were transmitted via telepathy instead of words <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=138 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This could be seen in works like [[Judith Merril]]\u2019s ''Whoever You Are'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Best of Judith Merril |url=https://epdf.pub/the-best-of-judith-merril.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=4 April 2020 |page=18-31}}</ref> and Michael Elder <ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Elder |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/ |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\u2019s ''Flight to Terror'' (also known as ''Perfumed Planet'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Perfumed Planet |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/perfumed-planet.htm |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>). However, the process of transmitting pictures still involves a hidden form of linguistic structure, as mentioned by Meyers:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIt is difficult to divorce the transmission of information in whatever medium from predications; introspection, if we can rely on it, seems to confirm that we think in linguistic structures.\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\" />\n}}\n\nThis brings back the question of barriers in language mentioned before. [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] attempted to address this issue in his work ''[[The Lotus Eaters]]'', where the partly telepathetic alien learned the language from humans through its ability to read links between words as well as the conceptual meanings of the words, though only after the words are used by the humans. One other example of this concept of telepathy being limited to the surface of one\u2019s conscious mind appears in ''[[To Die in Italbar]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].\n\n[[Robert Heinlein]]\u2019s ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', however, presents a rather convincing argument that words and not pictures are transmitted through telepathy <ref>{{cite book |last1=Walter |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=139 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. In the novel, the characters tried telepathy without using any words, but found \u201c...the silly, incoherent rumbling that went on in [the other\u2019s] mind in place of thought was as confusing and annoying, as senseless as finding yourself inside another person\u2019s dream <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |date=1956 |page=28}}</ref>. The habitual receiving of each other\u2019s thoughts as words was explained by the psychologist in the novel as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe ears and eyes and fingers are just data collectors; it is the brain that abstracts order out of chaos of data and gives it meaning\u2026 You expect words, your brain \u2018hears\u2019 words; it is a process used to and knows how to handle.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |pages=28-29}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDespite all these explanations offered by science fiction authors, telepathy still seems to be something unknown. As written in ''[[Blind Alley]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cTelepathy! Telepathy! Telepathy! Might as well say by witch brew; Nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name. What is the mechanism of telepathy? What is the physiology and the physics of it?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=Blind Alley |page=178}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSeveral characters in science fiction novels do attempt to explore the workings of telepathy, however, such as the characters in [[Walter M. Miller Jr.]]\u2019s ''Command Performance'', or  [[Fritz Leiber]]\u2019s ''Deadly Moon''. \n\nRegardless of the reason behind the use of telepathy by authors of science fiction, whether a real interest in the topic or convenience, it is as Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there is no question that writers find the subject a fertile one for an array of linguistic functions.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=145 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Perceptual dialectology]]\n* [[Folk linguistics]]\n* [[List of common misconceptions about language learning]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

As mentioned in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> by [[Walter E. Meyers]], science fiction is almost always concerned with the idea of communication <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>, such as communication with aliens and machines, or communication using dead languages and evolved languages of the future. Authors of science fiction at times use Linguistics and Linguistic theories as a tool for storytelling, although technical terms are rarely used with authors only going into as much detail as the reader will understand <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/5 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. \n\nWhile Linguistics can be found to be employed by writers of science fiction, it must be noted that not all uses are accurate to actual Linguistics and Linguistic Theories. Nevertheless, there still exists the lingering presence and use of Linguistics (even if inaccurate) in such cases. As mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, the ability to make a story seem more unfamiliar and exotic,  and an alien seem less of a costumed human who merely differs in physical appearance, is only possible through the use of language <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=8 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/8 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. It is this ability that appears to draw the boundary between great works of science fiction and those lesser so. As such, Linguistics, the scientific study of language, comes to hold an important role in the genre of science fiction.\n\n== History of Linguistics in Science Fiction ==\n\n== Alien Communication ==\n\nWhen dealing with alien languages, the general practice for science fiction, as described by Meyers, was to \u201cmine earlier stories for themes and approaches, frequently making references to what they regard as flaws or virtues in the works of their predecessors\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=96 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>. As such, it is common for science fiction works to be inspired by one another in terms of linguistics endeavours.\n\nTo have alien language involved in works of science fiction, there has to be contact between humans and extraterrestrial life forms. This is argued by Meyers to be a \u201cstaple\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=86 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> of science fiction. Despite the linguistic nature of such a task, Meyers laments that \u201cthe job of a linguist is handled by some other specialist\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=87 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> and in the works he examined, the characters seem to have no qualms with such a choice. There are several works of science fiction that have professionals with no linguistic training to undertake the attempts at communication with aliens. Such examples include professionals like  astronomers, geologists and poets. To some of these choices, Meyers suggests that the success of science fiction communications \u201cmight be the result of sheer good luck\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=88 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> for characters are often unfamiliar not only with the alien language they are faced, but linguistics as a whole.\n\nIn science fiction, the success in communication with extraterrestrial life forms often involve no attempt at solving the issue of the language barrier between the human characters and the alien characters. Meyers expresses his distaste for such writing in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' with:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cOne does not resolve a contradiction by asserting it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\" />\n}}\n\nGenerally, science fiction authors still use such a non-method. One such example is the translation circuit built into the TARDIS (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]) that automatically resolves any language barrier characters face in their space travel.\n\nAt the same time, science fiction is not completely devoid of attempts at solving the issue of language barriers between the different species of science fiction.\n\nIn ''Tetrahedra of Space'', author [[P. Schuyler Miller]] employs sign language as a means of communication between aliens and humans. This is, however, not before having considered other methods such as drawings. A notable attempt from the novel is that the human in the story draws a diagram of the solar system to explain to the alien its heliocentric nature. This method is susceptible to the [[arbitrariness]] of images. This is similar to the criticisms often applied to the [[Pioneer plaque]] by [[Frank Drake]] and [[Carl Sagan]] placed onboard the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft. The diagram in the story, much like the diagrams on the Pioneer plaque, can be easily misunderstood by any nonhuman life form that comes across it. In short, the strategy of using images to communicate with aliens in science fiction is not linguistically robust.\n\nAnother point of discussion brought up by Meyers is the question of whether or not aliens even have the sense of sight. The strategy of using images to communicate with aliens would not even be possible, regardless of its arbitrariness if the intended recipient is not even capable of seeing it. For example in ''Old Faithful'' by [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], a Martian astronomer detects a morse code message from Earth. Unfortunately for the Martian, not only can he not understand the message, he is deaf and mute and is therefore unfamiliar with the concept that sounds are put together to represent meanings in human language, nor that these strings of sound are represented by an [[orthography]] that can be encoded into signals. Throughout the book, Gallun made the Martian learn the messages he receives from Earth despite his disability.\n\nIn ''[[Swords of Mars]]'' of the [[Barsoom]] series, an example praised by Meyers, author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] documented a method with which his alien character uses to learn human language that is similar to that used by linguists. In one of the books, the alien character ignores the attempts of communication made by a human character for being too ambiguous. Instead, he points to things in his surroundings and asks the human for a name. This way, he slowly learns some words in English. \n\nIn ''The Winds of Time'' by [[Chad Oliver]], Oliver not only addressed the issue of there being language barrier but also described a method similar to those a linguist might employ when trying to document an unfamiliar language. The alien even goes on to look for [[minimal pairs]] and with his findings, builds an alien equivalent of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). The alien also learns human languages other than English, the majority language of where his ship landed. Oliver, however, glossed over the [[morphology (linguistics)]] and [[syntax]] part of learning a language and chose to summarise the entire process instead. Overall, Meyers praised this book as having \u201c[set] a high standard of excellence for the use of linguistics\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=100 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>.\n\nThe minority of its kind, ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by [[Ted Chiang]]  actually has a linguist attempt communication with an alien species that entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The linguistic concept used in the  novella, however, was the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The novella is the source material for the 2016 film, ''[[Arrival (film)]]''.\n\n== Deciphering Languages ==\n\nThe concept of unknown languages appears as a recurring theme in many science fiction books that contain alien languages. In some science fiction works, the deciphering of these unknown languages by protagonists of the story follow the linguistic method similar to that used in the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts using the [[Rosetta stone]]. This method involves comparing between translations of the same text, where at least one translation is in a known text. \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...to decipher a dead language one must have some way of getting into the circle, of finding a connection between something inside the system and something outside it.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=39 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/39 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis method can be seen in science fiction works such as [[Arrival (film)]] in which a part of the deciphering process involved acquiring translations of English sentences in the alien language to compare and decipher meanings. Another method used in the movie was learning the language one word at a time, see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]. This is not a recent phenomenon in science fiction, with such ideas appearing even earlier such as in ''[[This Perfect Day]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]. In the story, the world is unified under an oppressive rule with only one language. The protagonist, a nonconformist, later finds books in other foreign languages and attempts to decipher them with limited success, until he finds a book (in French)  with an essay by the founder of the unified world, an essay which already has a translated version available to him in the language he knows. This, in the same way as the Rosetta Stone helps him decipher the language (French). Some other works involve lesser accidental Rosetta Stones but rather deliberate clues with the explicit intention of helping future populations decipher the language. In such cases, since there is no way of knowing what future communication is like, there is preference to use illustrations and other instructional material to help future populations learn the unknown language. Such methods can be found in works such as The Retreat to Mars by Cecil B. White. \n\nOther works of science fiction involving language decipherment are ''[https://www.unz.com/print/ThrillingWonder-1943aug-00049 Expedition]'' by [[Anthony Boucher]] , ''Resurrection/[[The Monster (short story)]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]], ''[[Surface Tension (short story)]]'' by [[James Blish]], ''[[The Star (Clarke short story)|The Star]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and ''[[Omnilingual]]'' by [[H. Beam Piper]].\n\nWorks that contain more futile efforts of the decipherment of unknown languages include ''The Pastel City'' ([[Viriconium]] Book 1), ''No Jokes on Mars'' by [[James Blish]], and ''Patron of the Arts'' by [[William Rotsler]].\n\n== Language Change ==\n\nScience fiction highlights the common knowledge about language change, which most writers demonstrated to be very little. \n\n=== Historical Change ===\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cScience fiction as a genre, then, has a special relationship within the field of language within the field of language studies to historical linguistics.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/12 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, science fiction is the only genre that enables writers to either foresee the future of the language or the older forms of language, depending on the context of the story <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />. Despite this, many authors failed to realise the importance of linguistics in science fiction, even those with good knowledge of the field. As noted by [[John Krueger]]: \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...in perhaps one-third or thereabouts of s-f stories, problems of language and communication raise their head, though not always playing a major role.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />\n}}\n\nOne example of this can be viewed in the portrayal of [[historical linguistics]]. Historical linguistics entails the study of the older forms of language, and unfortunately, has been one of the lowest priorities in accuracy for science-fiction authors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/15 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. In some instances linguistic facts were disregarded such as in [[Harvey Jacobs]]\u2019s ''The Egg of the Glak'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=Harvey |title=The Egg of the Glak |url=https://epdf.pub/harvey-jacobs-the-egg-of-the-glak.html |website=epdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where the [[Great Vowel Shift]] was said to be caused by the [[Norman Conquest]]. In other instances, linguistic changes were misinterpreted such as in [[Larry Niven]]\u2019s ''The Fourth Profession'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/16 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there are authors who have employed linguistic change in their works fairly well. [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], for instance, conducted extensive research on the forms of English in different historical periods for his series ''[[Riverworld]]'', resulting in consistent accuracies with language change in English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIn general the treatment of linguistic change in science fiction is like the sky on a hazy night: a few bright spots seen through an obfuscating fog.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=18 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/18 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Evolutionary Change ===\n\nScience fiction authors have had differing views on how language will change in the future. Some believe English will become incomprehensible such as in  [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[The Time Machine]]''. Others hypothesize English will be influenced by other languages, as seen in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]]. There are, however, science fiction authors who choose neither and proclaim English as the \u201cinterstellar lingua franca as it had on Earth\u201d such as in [[Robert Silverberg]]\u2019s ''Schwartz Between the Galaxies'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Schwartz between the galaxies |url=https://archive.org/details/feastofstdionysu0000silv/page/n1 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=1 April 2020 |pages=79-104}}</ref>and in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which English is spoken by everyone. In his ''Visions of Tomorrow'', David Samuelson noted that many science-fiction authors prefer English as the universal spoken language in their stories <ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuelson |first1=David |title=Visions of Tomorrow |date=1975 |publisher=New York: Arno Press |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12296108?q&versionId=26107964 |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. For written English on the other hand, many science-fiction authors perceive a bleak future. This is seen in works such as [[Walter Miller, Jr.]]\u2019s ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', in which the people are reduced to illiteracy due to nuclear war. In [[Algis Budrys]]\u2019s ''For Love'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Budrys |first1=Algis |title=For Love |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n05_1962-06#page/n9/mode/2up |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, it is not nuclear war but rather alien invasion that causes this. In other works such as [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]'' and [[Robert Sheckley]]\u2019s ''Mindswap'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheckley |first1=Robert |title=Mindswap |url=https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v23n05_1965-06/page/n7/mode/2up/search/mindswap |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, written English is not completely wiped out but instead reduced to basic English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cmost science fiction writers have \u2026. the habit of being extremely slipshod about language\u2026 The time travelers hop three thousand years into the future and find people still speaking idiomatic New York English. (How many people today speak any language that was used in 1000 B.C.?)\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=22 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/22 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs from the quote by [[Fletcher Pratt]], the future of the language appears to be a topic brushed over by some science-fiction writers, where time-travellers into the future still find themselves being able to communicate perfectly in the same English regardless of the year from which the characters originate. [[Glottochronology]] assumes that a certain amount of basic words in a language will be lost after a thousand years and subsequently <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gudschinsky |first1=Sarah C. |title=The ABC'S of Lexicostatistics (Glottochronology) |journal=WORD |date=August 1956 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=175-210 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>. This would mean that the language as we know it now would not be fully similar in the far future. Certain writers believed sound recordings would hinder language change, as seen in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=27 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/27 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>.  \n\nHowever, not all writers give a lacklustre effort into the future of the language. Science-fiction writers mostly use two methods to demonstrate English of the future: some difference in pronunciation, and the insertion of a few words <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/29 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. The former can be seen in [[Bruce McAllister]]\u2019s ''Benji\u2019s Pencil'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=McAllister |first1=Bruce |title=Benji's Pencil |url=https://archive.org/stream/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF/Fantasy__Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF_djvu.txt |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where English is described as sounding like \u201cnasalised English, chopped but softer than German\u201d 200 years into the future. The inclusion of new words comprise of either forming new words, such as \u201cgoffin\u201d  in [[James Blish]]\u2019s ''[[A Work of Art]]'', or using old words in a new sense such as in [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''The Star Pit'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Samuel R. |title=The Star Pit |url=https://archive.org/details/samuelrdelanythestarpit04/Samuel_R_Delany-The_Star_Pit-01+WBAI.mp3 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, in which the word \u201cgolden\u201d is used as a term referring to the only ones capable of withstanding the mental stress of piloting an intergalactic craft. \n\nSuch assumptions on the evolution of language in science fiction might be helpful in predicting the future of language in reality as seen in an undertaking by Peter Stockwell <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stockwell |first1=Peter |title=Futuretalk: one small step towards a Chronolinguistics |journal=Nottingham Linguistic Circular |date=2000 |volume=15 |pages=55-68}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, all in all, the state of language change in science fiction may be summarized well by the following excerpt from ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' by Walter E. Meyers <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=36-37 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/36 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...science fiction is a window not into the future but into the present: in its stories we see what the writers know about language in general and historical linguistics in particular.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\" />\n}}\n\n== Learning Alien Language ==\n\n== Language Medium ==\n\nWith invented species, aliens, and other such characters in science fiction comes not only constructed languages but also new mediums using which these characters speak. As Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the science fiction writer frequently invents both the message and the medium.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=69 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=10 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Auditory (Sound)===\n\nA common medium of communication employed by science fiction authors, however, is the familiar one of vocal-auditory used by humans. In order to make this more exotic and suited to the alien theme of the story, some writers choose to tweak the method of producing this medium of communication. This could come in the form of a difference in physiology or structure of the alien as seen in [[Isaac Asimov]]\u2019s ''[[Hostess]]''. In his story, Asimov\u2019s alien is described as having a different mouth structure to a human, although his speech sounds similar to that of a human on Earth:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe construction of his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors , gave a whistling sound to the sibilants. Aside from that, he might have been born on Earth for all the accent his speech showed.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=The Complete Stories |date=1951 |page=354}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Gordon R. Dickson]] describes just as much in his work ''The Christmas Present'' (see: [[The Star Road]]), with the jellyfish-like alien described as having a voice that was:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...croaky and unbeautiful, for a constricted air-sac is not built for the manufacture of human words.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dickson |first1=Gordon R. |title=The Christmas Present |date=1973 |page=83}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[John Brunner]] also goes into detail about the method of sound production of his aliens in his work ''The Dramaturges of Yan'', writing that the aliens had lungs at their sides,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...drawing in air directly through spiracles between the ribs; like bagpipes, they had continual through-put. Sound to talk with was generated by a tympanal membrane and relayed through resonating chambers in the gullet, giving a rather pleasant, if not monotonous, timbre; in Kaydad\u2019s case, resembling a cello droning away on a single note\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunner |first1=John |title=The Dramaturges of Yan |date=1972 |page=44}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] uses a rather different method from these in his work ''Friend to Man'' (see: ''[[The Explorers (collection)]]''), in which the alien resembles a cello in the way it produces sound and not just in the way it sounds. This method of producing sound is described in the following excerpt of an interaction between the alien and a man named Smith who was rescued by the alien:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\"Salt?\" asked Smith, his voice thin in the thin air. \u201cI need salt with water.\u201d\nThe thing rubbed two appendages together and he saw a drop of amber exude and spread on them. It was, he realised a moment later, rosining the bow, for the appendages drew across each other and he heard a whining, vibrating cricket voice say: \u201cS-s-z-z-aw-w?\u201d\nIt did better the next time. The amber drop spread, and \u201cS-z-aw-t?\u201d was sounded, with a little tap of the bow for the final phoneme.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kornbluth |first1=Cyril M. |title=Friend to Man |date=1951 |page=243}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis theme of aliens producing sound in a way similar to a musical instrument (and perhaps physically resembling one as well) is continued by [[James Blish]] in his work ''This Earth of Hours''. In the story, the aliens are known as \u201cCall\u00ebans\u201d and the character, 12-UpJohn, discovers how they spoke, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the sounds issued at low volume from a multitude of spiracles or breath-holes all along the body, each hole producing only one pure tone, the words and intonations being formed in mid-air by intermodulation - a miracle of co-ordination among a multitude of  organs obviously unsuitable for sound-forming at all.\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blish |first1=James |title=This Earth of Hours |journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |date=June 1959 |page=12}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe theme of musical communication has appeared in science fiction as early as 1638 in [[Francis Godwin]]\u2019s work ''[[The Man in the Moone]]''. It also appeared in [[Winfred P. Lehmann]]\u2019s ''Decoding of the Martian Language''. Since W. P. Lehmann is a linguist, his story was explained in far greater scientific detail than most other science fiction authors.\n\nWhen it comes to the auditory medium, however, there is also communication at frequencies above and below that of what is audible to humans. For example, in [[Henry Kuttner]]\u2019s ''The Big Night'', the aliens communicate using frequencies below what is audible to humans (subsonics) and wears a device to increase this frequency to one that is audible to humans when communicating with them. In ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'' by [[Hal Clement]], the alien is able to communicate in both a frequency higher than what is perceived by humans and a frequency perceivable by humans. The aliens in ''[[In a Good Cause\u2014]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] had similar abilities, having a specialised organ for the higher frequencies and a separate one for frequencies audible to humans. \n\nMore science fiction stories involving the vocal-auditory medium as a means of communication include ''[[Proxima Centauri (short story)]]'' by [[Murray Leinster]], ''[[Arrival (film)]]'' (although the aliens in ''Arrival'' had two mediums of communication, one vocal-auditory and the other through visuals), and even the aliens present in ''[[Star Trek]]''.\n\n==== Visual (Sight) ====\n\nSecond most popular choice of language medium in science fiction is the visual medium or sight. One such story using this medium is ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]'' by Kilgore Trout ([[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]), in which the aliens used their limbs to make signs in order to communicate:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\u201cWhat do they talk with?\u201d Simon said to Chworktap.\n\t\u201cThey use their fingers, just like deaf-and-dumb people.\u201d\n\u2026 Their arms came out, the fingers wriggling and crossing and bending as they asked each other what in the hell these strangers were and what did they mean to do?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Philip Jos\u00e9 |title=Venus on the Half-Shell |date=1975 |page=101}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[James Blish]] also explored the use of visual medium in communication in his work ''VOR''. In the story, the alien communicated using colour-shifts in the light spectrum (displayed colours on in the front of its head). Similar to this was the aliens in [[Rex Gordon]]\u2019s ''First on Mars/[[No Man Friday]]'', in which the aliens (as big as freight trains) also communicated using light with the main character saying \u201c...there simply has not been on Earth such a colloquy of light.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Rex |title=No Man Friday |date=1956 |page=158}}</ref>. In ''[[What Is This Thing Called Love? (short story)]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], the aliens also communicated through colour, using color patches that changed hue to communicate. In ''Death and Designation Among the Asadi'' by [[Michael Bishop (author)]], Bishop describes in detail a similar form of communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAs for the staring matches, they\u2019re of brief duration and involve fierce gesticulation and mane-shaking. In these head-to-head confrontations the eyes change colour with astonishing rapidity, flashing through the entire visible spectrum -and maybe beyond- in a matter of seconds.\n\tI am now prepared to say that these instantaneous changes of eye color are the Asadi equivalent of speech\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Michael |title=Death and Designation Among the Asadi |date=January 1973 |page=175}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Olfactory (Smell)===\n\nAlthough much more challenging to employ, smell has also been used as a medium of communication by science fiction authors. In ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]], the aliens (T\u2019worlies) communicate through smells. As noticed by a human character in the story, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe vinegary smell deepened.It was a sign of polite cogitation in a T\u2019worlie, like a human being\u2019s hmmm\u201d <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=42}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSimilar to this method of communication is the alien species in ''Cabin Boy'' (see ''[[Far Out (book)]]'') by [[Damon Knight]]. In this story, two humans attempt to communicate with the alien that uses scent, although this proves rather difficult:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there had been a series of separate odors, all unfamiliar and all overpoweringly strong. At least a dozen of them, Roget thought; they had gone past too quickly to count.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Damon |title=Far Out |date=1951 |chapter=Cabin Boy}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs Meyers points out, however, the challenge in \u201c...using air-borne scents for communication is that even a casual breeze becomes \u201cnoise\u201d in the system, blending odors and distorting their original sequence.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=80 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>. Then again, [[Colin Kapp]] overcomes this problem in his work ''The Old King\u2019s Answers'', in which the one character describes the aliens as having:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...scent glands in the pads of their feet\u2026 They\u2019ve settled on the flat faces of the crystal rocks when they really want to leave a message for the world.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\">{{cite book |last1=Kapp |first1=Colin |title=The Old King's Answers |date=1973 |page=167}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe character further goes on to explain:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cUsing chromatography, I\u2019ve managed to identify three individual scent products, all of them remarkably persistent. They are combined together on the crystal faces in an amazing spectrum of complexity. In their scent-writing they have the capacity -though I\u2019m not sure how much of it they utilize- to compress more bits of information in a given space than we humans can in our optical writing.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\" />\n}}\n\nThis medium of smell was also utilised by [[John Norman]] [LINK] in his work ''Priest-Kings of Gor'' (Book 3 of ''[[Gor]]''), in which the medium is not only described but the advantages and disadvantages of it is also discussed. In the story, the narrator describes the medium, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cWhat in the passageways I had taken to be the scent of Priest-Kings had actually been the residue of odor-signals which Priest-Kings, like certain social insects of our world, use in communicating with one another.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=77}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe narrator then goes on to discuss in length the advantageous and disadvantageous of such a medium:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cCommunication by odor-signals can in certain circumstances be extremely efficient, though it can be disadvantageous in others. For example, an odor can carry\u2026 much farther than can the shout or cry of a man to another man. Moreover, if not too much time is allowed to elapse, a Priest-King may leave a message in his chamber or in a corridor for another Priest-King, and the other may arrive later and interpret. A disadvantage of this mode of communication, of course, is that the message may be understood by strangers or by others for whom it is not intended. One must be careful of what one says in the tunnels of the Priest-Kings for one\u2019s words may linger after one, until they sufficiently dissipate to be little more than a meaningless blur of scent.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=78}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince, Norman placed his setting in \u201ctunnels\u201d, he rid himself of any problems posed by winds. A similar approach was taken by [[Hal Clement]] in his work ''[[Uncommon Sense]]'', in which he had gotten rid of air altogether by assuming his setting to be an airless planet.\n\n=== Kinesics (Movement/Gestures)===\n\nAs explained by Meyers, gestures\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...are as arbitrary in their meanings as any spoken word: they depend for their intelligibility on the prior agreement by the members of the community.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=82 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis code-like aspect of gestures is seen in science fiction stories involving [[kinesics]] as a medium for language. One such example of this is seen in ''Orn'' (Book 2 of ''[[Of Man and Manta]]'') by [[Piers Anthony]]. In this story, \u201cmanta-shaped flying fungoids\u201d used kinesics for communication in that they snapped their tails once for \u2018yes\u2019 and twice for \u2018no\u2019 when communicating with humans. This code eventually evolved and allowed the fungoids to initiate conversation \u201cwith that combination of gesture and tail snaps they had gradually worked out as their code\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=Piers |title=Orn |date=1970 |page=147}}</ref>.\n\nIn some cases, however, kinesics was not employed as a medium of communication on its own but together with other mediums. For example, in ''The Dance of the Changer and the Three'' by [[Terry Carr]], the aliens called Loarrans communicated via \u201cwave-dancing\u201d and seemed in part an artform rather than just communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe dance he went through to give the description was intricate and even imaginative\u2026 It used motion and color and sound and another sense something like smell.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Terry |title=The Dance of the Changer and the Three |date=1968}}</ref> \n}}\n\nIn the case of the Nildoror, aliens in ''[[Downward to the Earth]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], they had no limbs that they were able to use to gesture (having walked on all fours). Hence, they had other appendages to do so. As the narrator explains:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe spiny crest down the middle of the alien\u2019s broad skull began to twitch\u2026 The nildoror had a rich language of gesture, employing not only the spines but also their long ropy trunks and their many-pleated ears,\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Downward to the Earth |date=1970 |pages=8-9}}</ref>  \n}}\n\nThere are also some science fiction works that include tactile ([[touch]]) as a medium of communication. These include works such as ''[[Memoirs of a Spacewoman]]'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\n== Machines & Language ==\n\n=== Machine Speech ===\n\nMachines have been another popular theme in science fiction works, appearing in works like ''[[I, Robot (film)]]'', ''[[Ex Machina (film)]]'' , ''[[Chappie (film)]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even much older works such as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. In such works, machines are portrayed with the ability to speak just as well or even better than humans. This ability is almost always explained from the perspective of computer programming as was done in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'', although it has just as much to do with linguistics, especially in order to sound natural enough to be indistinguishable from a regular human. \n\n[[Speech synthesis]] occurring in science fiction works can be categorised into two forms. The first form is synthesised speech, which is completely produced by the machine itself and is the form of speech synthesis portrayed by Robert A. Heinlein in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress''. The second form appearing in science fiction works is one in which stored pre-recorded bits of human speech are assembled by the machine to form speech <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/45/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>. This form of machine-generated speech appeared in works such as ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] in which speech produced by the machine was void of any intonations or other prosody. \n\nIn more recent works, such as ''I, Robot'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', machines are portrayed as having speech that sounds just as natural as that of a regular human. In ''The Machine'' by [[John W. Campbell]] (from ''The Best of John W. Campbell''), the machine-produced voice was described as being \u201c...peculiarly commanding, a superhuman voice of perfect clarity and perfect resonance. It was commanding, attracting, yet pleasant.\u201d. This manner of human-like speech can also be seen in ''You\u2019ll take the High Road'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] (from ''Three Trips in Time and Space'') and ''[[Galactic Pot-Healer]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Ira Levin has also utilised the idea of fluent human-like speech in his science fiction work ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', in which human-like androids are made to replace mens\u2019 wives after they have been murdered by their husbands. The androids, needing to be perfect copies of the women, use machine-generated voices that gain their vocabulary from recordings of the women\u2019s actual voices.\n\nHowever, in many other works, machine speech was used to portray \u201chuman depersonalisation\u201d. In ''Promises to Keep: A Science Fiction Drama'' from ''Alien Horizons'' by [[William F. Nolan]], Nolan described the computerised ship\u2019s voice as \u201cmetallic, emotionless\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\" />. This portrayal could be traced back to even older works such as ''The Last Evolution'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=John W. Campbell, Jr. |title=The Last Evolution |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27462/27462-h/27462-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020 |archivedate=December 2008}}</ref> by John W. Campbell in which machine speech was described as\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the vibrationally correct, emotionless tones of all the race of machines.\u201d \n}}\n\nOther work involving this theme of depersonalisation includes works such as ''[[It's Such a Beautiful Day]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], ''[[The Quest for Saint Aquin]]'' by Anthony Boucher, ''The Hawks of Arcturus'' by Cecil Snyder, ''I, the Unspeakable'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Walter J. Sheldon |title=I, the Unspeakable |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51210 |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Walter J. Sheldon<ref>{{cite web |title=Walter J. Sheldon |url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Sheldon |website=Wikip\u00e9dia |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=French}}</ref>, and ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' by [[Anne McCaffrey]].\n\nGiven the scientific capabilities to add prosody to machine-generated speech, Walter E. Meyers was critical of this use of emotionless machine speech in science fiction works, as shown from the following excerpt:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the problems of adding pitch, stress, and juncture (the transitions between words and phrases) to machine-produced speech were mastered well before William F. Nolan wrote the passage\u2026 Writers who now speak of emotionless mechanical voices do so either through ignorance or, more probably, because they value the symbolism involved more highly than scientific accuracy.\u201d \n}}\n\nMore works utilising the general theme of machine speech are ''Jamboree'' by [[Jack Williamson]], ''Becalmed in Hell'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Larry Niven |title=Becalmed in Hell |url=https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781481483605/9781481483605___6.htm |website=Space Pioneers |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Larry Niven, ''Starchild'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]] (part of the ''[[Starchild Trilogy]]''), ''Evane (1973)'' by [[E.C. Tubb]], and ''Stranger Station'' by [[Damon Knight]].\n\n=== Automatic Translators ===\n\nIn many works of science fiction with language as part of the plot, the idea of automatic translators has been frequently brought up <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Alien and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=119 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/119/mode/2up |accessdate=6 April 2020 |chapter=8}}</ref>. These translators can be split into two main types: translators translating from a known language to another known language, and those translating from an unknown language to a known language. \n\nWalter E. Meyers noted that translators of the first kind (known-to-known) were usually small devices, \u201c...typically worn as a pendent or pinned to the shirt\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\" />. This can be seen in ''Jackal\u2019s Meal'' (collected in ''[[The Star Road]]'') by [[Gordon R. Dickson]]. Such a device also appeared in ''A Little Knowledge'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which a small device worn on the chest and called a \u2018Vocalizer\u2019 translated English into the known language of aliens. More works involving this type of automatic translators include ''The Brains of Earth'' by [[Jack Vance]].\n\nThe second type of translator (unknown-to-known) seems to appear more often in science fiction works and can be alternatively known as a \u201c[[Universal Translator]]\u201d. In ''I\u2019ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty'' by [[James Tiptree Jr.]], the protagonist uses a universal translator called the \u2018Omniglot Mark Eight Vocoder\u2019 that instantly translates whatever is being said to the necessary alien language although the characters themselves do not know what language that is. \n\nThe universal translator also makes multiple appearances in science fiction movies and shows. In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)]]'', a universal translator is introduced during the tour of the MIB headquarters, and in ''[[Star Trek]]'', a Universal Translator  is frequently used to translate alien languages into known languages of the user. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also played with the idea of a universal translator, with the universal translator being part of the Tardis. This recurring theme of universal translators being part of a ship or mode of transport was also seen in ''[[Ringworld]]'' by Larry Niven.\n\nContrary to this theme, works such as ''[[Inconstant Moon#\"How the Heroes Die\"|\"How the Heroes Die\"]]'' also by Larry Niven and ''Unhuman Sacrifice'' by [[Katherine Maclean]] portrayed the universal translator as a less portable, more fixed-in-place computer. Even further from this theme are works such as ''[[The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which the universal translator is not in the form of a machine at all. In ''The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy'', the universal translator exists instead as a \u2018babel fish\u2019 that is inserted into the ear.\n\n== Animals and Language ==\n\n== Telepathy ==\n\n[[Telepathy]] has been a recurring [[motif (narrative)]] in science fiction stories, for the most part being used as a convenient tool to bypass linguistic problems that writers encounter <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=131 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This is illustrated in [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923). In this science fiction story, telepathy is used in daily communications, although the accuracy of what is communicated differs from person to person, with thought being rephrased and reflected based on the receiver's linguistic ability. Wells, through his character's dialogue, directly mentions how convenient a solution telepathy is to linguistic problems such as  language barriers (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAnd all things considered, it is really very convenient for us that there should be this method of transmission. For otherwise, I do not see how we could have avoided weeks of linguistic bother, first principles of our respective grammars, logic, significs, and so forth, boring stuff for the most part, before we could have got to anything like our present understanding\u201d \n}} (Excerpt from ''Men like Gods'')\n\nHowever, while conveniently giving a solution to that linguistic issue, Wells form of telepathy seemed to create problems for other aspects of linguistics. Given that language change resulted from variations in speech, Walter E. Meyers suggested that this telepathy would result in an obstruction to language evolution (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Evolutionary Change|Evolutionary Change]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...a universal telepathic power would slow down, and perhaps even halt [language] change altogether, if (and this is an important condition) change in language results from normal but inevitable variation in speech forms\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=134-135 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAlthough affecting speech, telepathy would not isolate writing from changes, as illustrated by Burrough in his Martian novels, where Mars has several forms of written language despite having only one spoken language. \n\nAs noted by Walter E. Meyers, Wells use of telepathy implies that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...telepathy transmits linguistic constructions\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=136 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn doing so, however, differences between linguistic, lexical, and even cultural concepts of different language speakers would still hinder understanding between speakers using telepathy. The challenges presented by cultural barriers, for example, was presented in the work ''Prott'' by [[Margaret St. Clair]], in which a telepath laments that despite conducting 52 interviews with aliens named \u201cPrott\u201d he has been unable to learn much. As John W. Campbell pointed out in an editorial (see: [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]: Astounding, June 1941)\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cMost of our words have background references that we know so well we tend to overlook them.\u201d \n}}\n\nAs per this quote, these background references may be easily understood by speakers of a language but not to the rest. Paul A. Carter summarised this well when explaining that \u201c... in situations demanding discernment of the cultural context of words, there might be trouble.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=137 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>.\n\nGiven such a problem, some science-fiction writers suggested pictures were transmitted via telepathy instead of words <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=138 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This could be seen in works like [[Judith Merril]]\u2019s ''Whoever You Are'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Best of Judith Merril |url=https://epdf.pub/the-best-of-judith-merril.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=4 April 2020 |page=18-31}}</ref> and Michael Elder <ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Elder |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/ |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\u2019s ''Flight to Terror'' (also known as ''Perfumed Planet'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Perfumed Planet |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/perfumed-planet.htm |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>). However, the process of transmitting pictures still involves a hidden form of linguistic structure, as mentioned by Meyers:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIt is difficult to divorce the transmission of information in whatever medium from predications; introspection, if we can rely on it, seems to confirm that we think in linguistic structures.\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\" />\n}}\n\nThis brings back the question of barriers in language mentioned before. [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] attempted to address this issue in his work ''[[The Lotus Eaters]]'', where the partly telepathetic alien learned the language from humans through its ability to read links between words as well as the conceptual meanings of the words, though only after the words are used by the humans. One other example of this concept of telepathy being limited to the surface of one\u2019s conscious mind appears in ''[[To Die in Italbar]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].\n\n[[Robert Heinlein]]\u2019s ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', however, presents a rather convincing argument that words and not pictures are transmitted through telepathy <ref>{{cite book |last1=Walter |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=139 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. In the novel, the characters tried telepathy without using any words, but found \u201c...the silly, incoherent rumbling that went on in [the other\u2019s] mind in place of thought was as confusing and annoying, as senseless as finding yourself inside another person\u2019s dream <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |date=1956 |page=28}}</ref>. The habitual receiving of each other\u2019s thoughts as words was explained by the psychologist in the novel as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe ears and eyes and fingers are just data collectors; it is the brain that abstracts order out of chaos of data and gives it meaning\u2026 You expect words, your brain \u2018hears\u2019 words; it is a process used to and knows how to handle.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |pages=28-29}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDespite all these explanations offered by science fiction authors, telepathy still seems to be something unknown. As written in ''[[Blind Alley]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cTelepathy! Telepathy! Telepathy! Might as well say by witch brew; Nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name. What is the mechanism of telepathy? What is the physiology and the physics of it?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=Blind Alley |page=178}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSeveral characters in science fiction novels do attempt to explore the workings of telepathy, however, such as the characters in [[Walter M. Miller Jr.]]\u2019s ''Command Performance'', or  [[Fritz Leiber]]\u2019s ''Deadly Moon''. \n\nRegardless of the reason behind the use of telepathy by authors of science fiction, whether a real interest in the topic or convenience, it is as Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there is no question that writers find the subject a fertile one for an array of linguistic functions.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=145 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Perceptual dialectology]]\n* [[Folk linguistics]]\n* [[List of common misconceptions about language learning]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

In his book ''Rivolta contro il mondo moderno'' (''Revolt against the Modern World''; 1934) Evola writes that in the \"Golden Age\" the center of the \"Olympic civilization\" that spread across the Eurasian continent was in a \"Boreal\" or Nordic \"region\". The [[Thule-Gesellschaft]], a secret society of which the [[Nazi]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] was a member, believed that the [[Aryan race]] came from the mythical northern province of Hyperborea.\n\nIn the [[discourse]] of twenty-first-century [[postmodern]] politics, the term ''boreal'' is used by politicians like [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in [[France]] and [[Thierry Baudet]] in [[The Netherlands]] to refer vaguely and semi-[[myth|mythically]] to Northern Europe and its ethnic groups, culture and languages. The term is used to imply a white cultural and political space \"from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Vladivostok]]\", as opposed to the [[international migration|migrating]] [[minorities]], in an attempt to avoid openly [[racism|racist]] connotations. Thus the term \"boreal\" is used as a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] way of saying \"white\" when referring to [[White people]]. Le Pen's statements about a \"boreal Europe\" and \"white world\" contributed to him being expelled by [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015 as a member of the [[Front National]].<ref>[https://www.counter-currents.com/2015/04/jean-marie-le-pens-rivarol-interview/ ''\u201cWe must save Boreal Europe & the white world\u201d'': Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s Rivarol Interview] Counter-Currents Publishing, 9 april 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/race-blanche-pour-jean-marie-le-pen-nadine-morano-a-enonce-une-evidence-historique-7779898077 ''Race blanche\" : pour Jean-Marie Le Pen, Nadine Morano a \"\u00e9nonc\u00e9 une \u00e9vidence historique'']</ref> \n\nThe term has also been used by [[Russian nationalism|Russian-nationalist movements]] since the 1990s after the [[German reunification|fall of the Berlin wall]] as an indication of ethnic [[Russians]]. \n\nIn the Netherlands, [[Forum for Democracy]] (FvD) leader Thierry Baudet introduced the word in a political context.<ref>''[https://decorrespondent.nl/7955/hoe-thierry-baudet-aan-de-lippen-hing-van-jean-marie-le-pen/811713530980-29774dcf Hoe Thierry Baudet aan de lippen hing van Jean-Marie Le Pen]''</ref> At the first party congress of the FvD in 2017, he spoke about \"our boreal Europe\"; in the victory speech he gave to his followers after the [[2019 Dutch provincial elections]], about \"our boreal world\".<ref>''[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/03/on-owls-women-and-the-boreal-world-10-things-thierry-baudet-has-said/ On owls, women and the boreal world: 10 things Thierry Baudet has said]''</ref><ref>''[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/thierry-baudet-dutch-rightwing-populism Meet Thierry Baudet, the suave new face of Dutch rightwing populism]''</ref><ref>''[https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/28/the-new-face-of-the-dutch-far-right-fvd-thierry-baudet-netherlands-pvv-geert-wilders The New Face of the Dutch Far-Right - Thierry Baudet once called politicians brain-dead.

Whiting was arrested a few weeks later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red [[Ford Sierra]], which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.<ref name=\"first victim\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}\n\nThree months later, Whiting admitted charges of abduction and [[indecent assault]], and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence for the crime was [[life imprisonment]]; however, he received a lesser sentence because he had admitted to the crime at an early opportunity, although a [[psychiatrist]] who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.<ref name=\"freed to kill\"/>\n\nWhiting was released from prison in November 1997, having served 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offenders' register]]. He had been forced to serve an extra five months in prison before being released on licence as penalty for refusing to undergo a sex offenders rehabilitation course.<ref name=\"refused treatment\"/>\n\nWhiting moved {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=}} away from Crawley to [[Littlehampton]] on the West Sussex coast, upon his release.<ref name=\"co973236\"/>{{Better source|reason=Sensationalist tabloid, more objective article available?|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Sarah Payne's disappearance==\nSarah Payne, who lived in [[Hersham]], [[Surrey]], disappeared on the evening of 1 July 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne, in [[Kingston Gorse]], [[West Sussex]], England.<ref name=\"sworn in\"/> Payne had been playing with her two elder brothers (aged 13 and 11 at the time) and younger sister (aged 6).<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/> A nationwide search commenced within 48 hours, and Payne's parents made numerous television and newspaper appeals for her safe return. On the evening of 2 July 2000, officers from Sussex Police first visited Whiting making inquiries into Payne's disappearance. A number of other suspects were also questioned and at least one other person was arrested.<ref name=\"nowhere near\"/>\n\nPolice officers and numerous volunteers scoured the area around Littlehampton for clues to Sarah's disappearance, and her family made daily appeals on national television news for help in finding Sarah. On 10 July, police announced that they had received information regarding the sighting of a girl who matched Sarah's description at [[Knutsford Services]] on the [[M6 motorway]] in [[Cheshire]] on the morning after her disappearance. Three days later, Michael and Sara Payne were warned by police to \"prepare for the worst\", explaining that the emphasis of their inquiries had shifted and that there was a possibility that their daughter might not be found safe and well.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nOn 17 July, a body was found in a field near [[Pulborough]], some {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=}} from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared. Within 24 hours, [[forensic]] science tests confirmed that the body was that of Sarah Payne, and [[Sussex Police]] began a murder investigation.<ref name=\"body confirmed\"/>\n\n==Murder investigation==\nWhiting was first questioned about the disappearance of Payne, which had taken place about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from Whiting's home, some 24 hours after she went missing. Whiting was routinely questioned as he had been placed on the [[sex offender registry]]. On the officers' first visit to Whiting's home earlier that day, he was not there. The police returned five hours later and questioned Whiting for over an hour before leaving.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/>\n\nSoon after questioning, Whiting walked to his van, but was stopped by undercover police and arrested.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/> Whiting spent two days in custody, but there was no evidence to press any charges and Whiting was released on bail. Police had found a receipt for fuel from Buck Barn garage on the [[A24 (road)|A24]], not far from [[Coolham]] where one of Payne's shoes was found.<ref name=\"I tell truth\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}<ref name=\"summer evening\"/> This contradicted his alibi of being at a [[funfair]] in [[Hove]] at 5:30&nbsp;pm and then returning to his flat by 9:30&nbsp;pm on the night that Payne had disappeared.<ref name=\"funfair alibi\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, a shoe was recovered from a roadside in the village of Coolham, three miles from Pulborough, and identified as one of those belonging to Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2000, Whiting stole a [[Vauxhall Nova]] and was pursued by police at speeds of up to {{convert|70|mph}} before crashing into a parked vehicle. Whiting was arrested on a charge of [[dangerous driving]]. Whiting was remanded in custody until 27 September 2000, when he admitted taking the car and driving dangerously and was jailed for 22 months.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting began his jail term for the car theft and dangerous driving, detectives carried out forensic tests on his 1988 white [[Fiat Ducato]] van, which he had bought on 23 June 2000. On 6 February 2001, following a police enquiry, Whiting was charged with the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"Rearrest\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nBy 6 February 2001, Sussex Police had enough evidence to press charges against Whiting, who appeared at [[Lewes Crown Court]] that day, charged with abduction and murder. Whiting pleaded not guilty to both charges and was remanded in custody, with his trial due to start on 14 November 2001. He was still serving his sentence for the motoring offences at this stage, but the new charges against him prevented his release from prison during the summer of that year for the motoring offences.<ref name=\"charged with murder\"/>\n\nOn 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court, the jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother who had seen a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade.<ref name=\"smiled\"/> One of Payne's shoes was found by a member of the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered.<ref name=\"examined shoe\"/> A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.<ref name=\"one in a billion\"/>\n\nOn 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Payne and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The trial judge said it was a rare case in which a life sentence [[whole life tariff|should mean life]].<ref name=\"guilty\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting was convicted, his previous convictions were revealed; it had previously been withheld from the jury and media amid police fears that any knowledge in court of his previous conviction could jeopardize the trial and in the event of being convicted, Whiting would argue that he had been tried on the evidence of an earlier crime, paving the way for a potentially successful appeal. There were renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offender's register]], although the [[Home Office]] commented the day after Whiting's conviction that such a system would be \"unworkable\" and run the risk of driving paedophiles \"underground\", making it more difficult for the police to monitor and locate them, as well as putting them in danger of vigilante attacks.<ref name=\"unworkable\"/>\n\nThis case is also notable for the extensive use of forensic sciences in establishing the prosecution case against Whiting. Twenty forensic experts from a variety of fields were employed during the inquiry, including [[entomology]], palynology/environmental profiling, [[pathology]], geology, [[archaeology]], and oil/lubricant analysis. It has been estimated<ref>{{cite web |last1=Acford |first1=Louise |title=Sarah Payne investigation cost nearly \u00a33m |url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1859160.sarah-payne-investigation-cost-nearly-3m/ |website=Argus on line newspaper |publisher=Newsquest, a Gannet company |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> that the investigation involved one thousand personnel and cost more than \u00a32 million.\n\n===Sentencing===\nOn 24 November 2002, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning that he would have to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an agreement with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff.<ref name=\"50 years\"/> Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer ([[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|Anthony Anderson]]) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.<ref name=\"lords defy blunkett\"/>\n\nIn June 2004, it was confirmed that Whiting would be applying to the [[Court of Appeal]] for a new minimum term to be set.<ref name=\"plea for early\"/> On 9 June 2010, Whiting's appeal resulted in his 50-year jail term being reduced by 10 years by a High Court judge. Whiting's lawyers argued that the 50-year tariff, imposed just before the power of Home Secretaries to determine how long prisoners sentenced to life should serve lapsed, was politically motivated; the decision was also made at a time when the government was under fire from the public and media over a firefighters strike. [[Peregrine Simon|Mr Justice Simon]] said that under 2010 sentencing guidelines, Whiting may have received a [[whole life tariff]], but apparently<!-- unfortunately the BBC article is not fully clear on this --> arrived at the 40-year term by retroactively applying guidelines from the time of the original sentencing. Whiting is now serving a 40-year minimum term, which is set to keep him in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 82. Payne's mother, Sara, was present and said she was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"life should mean life\".<ref name=\"term reduced\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sarah's Law===\n{{redirect|Sarah's Law|the US proposal|California Proposition 4 (2008)}}\n{{See also|Criminal record#United Kingdom}}\nThe campaign for Sarah's Law  was spearheaded by the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, and began in July 2000 in response to the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah Payne's parents backed up the campaign as they were sure that a [[child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] had been responsible for their daughter's death. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of killing Sarah Payne, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.\n\nThe aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the [[sex offender registry]], so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender were living in their area. Sarah Payne's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter's life.\n\nA modified scheme where parents can enquire about a named individual was introduced in four pilot areas of England and Wales in September 2008. In August 2010 the [[Home Office]] announced that after proving successful, the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme would be extended to cover the whole of England and Wales by spring 2011.<ref name=\"no vigilante\"/>\n\n===Payne family===\nPayne's mother, [[Sara Payne]], has subsequently written a book, ''[[Sara Payne: A Mother's Story]]'', about her daughter's murder and the aftermath, including her campaign for Sarah's Law. The book was published in 2004.<ref name=\"payne240\"/>\n\nIn July 2001, it was reported that Payne's parents received \u00a311,000 compensation from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]], an executive agency of the [[UK Government]]. Sara Payne described the offer as a \"sick joke\" and \"derisory\", even though it was the maximum CICA could offer by law.<ref name=\"sick offer\"/> \n\nSara Payne was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in December 2008 for her work behind Sarah's Law.<ref name=\"Sara MBE\"/> In December 2011, she suffered a life-threatening stroke and collapsed while at her home.<ref name=\"collapsing\"/>\n\nIn July 2011 it was revealed that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].<ref name=\"news of the world\"/> Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara's phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World's editor at the time of the murder, [[Rebekah Brooks]].\n\nPayne's father, Michael, suffered from depression following the disappearance of his daughter.<ref name=\"father dead\"/> He separated from his wife of 18 years in August 2003, and subsequently became an alcoholic, leading to a 16-month jail term for attacking his brother with a glass in December 2011, during a drunken incident. On 30 October 2014, he was found dead at his home in [[Maidstone, Kent]]; police reported there were no suspicious circumstances.<ref name=\"father dead\"/>\n\n===Roy Whiting===\nOn 4 August 2002, Whiting was attacked with a razor by another prisoner while fetching hot water at [[Wakefield Prison]]. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in [[Cornwall]]) was found guilty of carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek.<ref name=\"bbcyorkshire\"/> Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Whiting. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time in prison if the [[Parole Board]] decides that he can be freed on [[life licence]].{{Citation needed|reason=Previous source was too generic|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn July 2011, Whiting was again attacked in prison, this time stabbed in the eye. No charge was pressed by Whiting and consequently a police investigation into the assault was not undertaken.  Whiting's injuries were not life-threatening.<ref name=\"Gary Vinter\"/>\n\nHe was attacked again on 8 November 2018, when he was stabbed by two other prisoners in his cell at HMP Wakefield. He was taken to hospital for treatment but returned to prison shortly after in a stable condition.<ref>{{Cite web |

Whiting was arrested a few weeks later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red [[Ford Sierra]], which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.<ref name=\"first victim\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}\n\nThree months later, Whiting admitted charges of abduction and [[indecent assault]], and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence for the crime was [[life imprisonment]]; however, he received a lesser sentence because he had admitted to the crime at an early opportunity, although a [[psychiatrist]] who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.<ref name=\"freed to kill\"/>\n\nWhiting was released from prison in November 1997, having served 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offenders' register]]. He had been forced to serve an extra five months in prison before being released on licence as penalty for refusing to undergo a sex offenders rehabilitation course.<ref name=\"refused treatment\"/>\n\nWhiting moved {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=}} away from Crawley to [[Littlehampton]] on the West Sussex coast, upon his release.<ref name=\"co973236\"/>{{Better source|reason=Sensationalist tabloid, more objective article available?|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Sarah Payne's disappearance==\nSarah Payne, who lived in [[Hersham]], [[Surrey]], disappeared on the evening of 1 July 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne, in [[Kingston Gorse]], [[West Sussex]], England.<ref name=\"sworn in\"/> Payne had been playing with her two elder brothers (aged 13 and 11 at the time) and younger sister (aged 6).<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/> A nationwide search commenced within 48 hours, and Payne's parents made numerous television and newspaper appeals for her safe return. On the evening of 2 July 2000, officers from Sussex Police first visited Whiting making inquiries into Payne's disappearance. A number of other suspects were also questioned and at least one other person was arrested.<ref name=\"nowhere near\"/>\n\nPolice officers and numerous volunteers scoured the area around Littlehampton for clues to Sarah's disappearance, and her family made daily appeals on national television news for help in finding Sarah. On 10 July, police announced that they had received information regarding the sighting of a girl who matched Sarah's description at [[Knutsford Services]] on the [[M6 motorway]] in [[Cheshire]] on the morning after her disappearance. Three days later, Michael and Sara Payne were warned by police to \"prepare for the worst\", explaining that the emphasis of their inquiries had shifted and that there was a possibility that their daughter might not be found safe and well.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nOn 17 July, a body was found in a field near [[Pulborough]], some {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared. Within 24 hours, [[forensic]] science tests confirmed that the body was that of Sarah Payne, and [[Sussex Police]] began a murder investigation.<ref name=\"body confirmed\"/>\n\n==Murder investigation==\nWhiting was first questioned about the disappearance of Payne, which had taken place about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from Whiting's home, some 24 hours after she went missing. Whiting was routinely questioned as he had been placed on the [[sex offender registry]]. On the officers' first visit to Whiting's home earlier that day, he was not there. The police returned five hours later and questioned Whiting for over an hour before leaving.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/>\n\nSoon after questioning, Whiting walked to his van, but was stopped by undercover police and arrested.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/> Whiting spent two days in custody, but there was no evidence to press any charges and Whiting was released on bail. Police had found a receipt for fuel from Buck Barn garage on the [[A24 (road)|A24]], not far from [[Coolham]] where one of Payne's shoes was found.<ref name=\"I tell truth\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}<ref name=\"summer evening\"/> This contradicted his alibi of being at a [[funfair]] in [[Hove]] at 5:30&nbsp;pm and then returning to his flat by 9:30&nbsp;pm on the night that Payne had disappeared.<ref name=\"funfair alibi\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, a shoe was recovered from a roadside in the village of Coolham, three miles from Pulborough, and identified as one of those belonging to Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2000, Whiting stole a [[Vauxhall Nova]] and was pursued by police at speeds of up to {{convert|70|mph}} before crashing into a parked vehicle. Whiting was arrested on a charge of [[dangerous driving]]. Whiting was remanded in custody until 27 September 2000, when he admitted taking the car and driving dangerously and was jailed for 22 months.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting began his jail term for the car theft and dangerous driving, detectives carried out forensic tests on his 1988 white [[Fiat Ducato]] van, which he had bought on 23 June 2000. On 6 February 2001, following a police enquiry, Whiting was charged with the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"Rearrest\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nBy 6 February 2001, Sussex Police had enough evidence to press charges against Whiting, who appeared at [[Lewes Crown Court]] that day, charged with abduction and murder. Whiting pleaded not guilty to both charges and was remanded in custody, with his trial due to start on 14 November 2001. He was still serving his sentence for the motoring offences at this stage, but the new charges against him prevented his release from prison during the summer of that year for the motoring offences.<ref name=\"charged with murder\"/>\n\nOn 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court, the jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother who had seen a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade.<ref name=\"smiled\"/> One of Payne's shoes was found by a member of the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered.<ref name=\"examined shoe\"/> A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.<ref name=\"one in a billion\"/>\n\nOn 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Payne and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The trial judge said it was a rare case in which a life sentence [[whole life tariff|should mean life]].<ref name=\"guilty\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting was convicted, his previous convictions were revealed; it had previously been withheld from the jury and media amid police fears that any knowledge in court of his previous conviction could jeopardize the trial and in the event of being convicted, Whiting would argue that he had been tried on the evidence of an earlier crime, paving the way for a potentially successful appeal. There were renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offender's register]], although the [[Home Office]] commented the day after Whiting's conviction that such a system would be \"unworkable\" and run the risk of driving paedophiles \"underground\", making it more difficult for the police to monitor and locate them, as well as putting them in danger of vigilante attacks.<ref name=\"unworkable\"/>\n\nThis case is also notable for the extensive use of forensic sciences in establishing the prosecution case against Whiting. Twenty forensic experts from a variety of fields were employed during the inquiry, including [[entomology]], palynology/environmental profiling, [[pathology]], geology, [[archaeology]], and oil/lubricant analysis. It has been estimated<ref>{{cite web |last1=Acford |first1=Louise |title=Sarah Payne investigation cost nearly \u00a33m |url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1859160.sarah-payne-investigation-cost-nearly-3m/ |website=Argus on line newspaper |publisher=Newsquest, a Gannet company |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> that the investigation involved one thousand personnel and cost more than \u00a32 million.\n\n===Sentencing===\nOn 24 November 2002, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning that he would have to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an agreement with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff.<ref name=\"50 years\"/> Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer ([[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|Anthony Anderson]]) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.<ref name=\"lords defy blunkett\"/>\n\nIn June 2004, it was confirmed that Whiting would be applying to the [[Court of Appeal]] for a new minimum term to be set.<ref name=\"plea for early\"/> On 9 June 2010, Whiting's appeal resulted in his 50-year jail term being reduced by 10 years by a High Court judge. Whiting's lawyers argued that the 50-year tariff, imposed just before the power of Home Secretaries to determine how long prisoners sentenced to life should serve lapsed, was politically motivated; the decision was also made at a time when the government was under fire from the public and media over a firefighters strike. [[Peregrine Simon|Mr Justice Simon]] said that under 2010 sentencing guidelines, Whiting may have received a [[whole life tariff]], but apparently<!-- unfortunately the BBC article is not fully clear on this --> arrived at the 40-year term by retroactively applying guidelines from the time of the original sentencing. Whiting is now serving a 40-year minimum term, which is set to keep him in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 82. Payne's mother, Sara, was present and said she was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"life should mean life\".<ref name=\"term reduced\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sarah's Law===\n{{redirect|Sarah's Law|the US proposal|California Proposition 4 (2008)}}\n{{See also|Criminal record#United Kingdom}}\nThe campaign for Sarah's Law  was spearheaded by the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, and began in July 2000 in response to the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah Payne's parents backed up the campaign as they were sure that a [[child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] had been responsible for their daughter's death. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of killing Sarah Payne, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.\n\nThe aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the [[sex offender registry]], so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender were living in their area. Sarah Payne's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter's life.\n\nA modified scheme where parents can enquire about a named individual was introduced in four pilot areas of England and Wales in September 2008. In August 2010 the [[Home Office]] announced that after proving successful, the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme would be extended to cover the whole of England and Wales by spring 2011.<ref name=\"no vigilante\"/>\n\n===Payne family===\nPayne's mother, [[Sara Payne]], has subsequently written a book, ''[[Sara Payne: A Mother's Story]]'', about her daughter's murder and the aftermath, including her campaign for Sarah's Law. The book was published in 2004.<ref name=\"payne240\"/>\n\nIn July 2001, it was reported that Payne's parents received \u00a311,000 compensation from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]], an executive agency of the [[UK Government]]. Sara Payne described the offer as a \"sick joke\" and \"derisory\", even though it was the maximum CICA could offer by law.<ref name=\"sick offer\"/> \n\nSara Payne was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in December 2008 for her work behind Sarah's Law.<ref name=\"Sara MBE\"/> In December 2011, she suffered a life-threatening stroke and collapsed while at her home.<ref name=\"collapsing\"/>\n\nIn July 2011 it was revealed that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].<ref name=\"news of the world\"/> Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara's phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World's editor at the time of the murder, [[Rebekah Brooks]].\n\nPayne's father, Michael, suffered from depression following the disappearance of his daughter.<ref name=\"father dead\"/> He separated from his wife of 18 years in August 2003, and subsequently became an alcoholic, leading to a 16-month jail term for attacking his brother with a glass in December 2011, during a drunken incident. On 30 October 2014, he was found dead at his home in [[Maidstone, Kent]]; police reported there were no suspicious circumstances.<ref name=\"father dead\"/>\n\n===Roy Whiting===\nOn 4 August 2002, Whiting was attacked with a razor by another prisoner while fetching hot water at [[Wakefield Prison]]. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in [[Cornwall]]) was found guilty of carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek.<ref name=\"bbcyorkshire\"/> Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Whiting. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time in prison if the [[Parole Board]] decides that he can be freed on [[life licence]].{{Citation needed|reason=Previous source was too generic|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn July 2011, Whiting was again attacked in prison, this time stabbed in the eye. No charge was pressed by Whiting and consequently a police investigation into the assault was not undertaken.  Whiting's injuries were not life-threatening.<ref name=\"Gary Vinter\"/>\n\nHe was attacked again on 8 November 2018, when he was stabbed by two other prisoners in his cell at HMP Wakefield. He was taken to hospital for treatment but returned to prison shortly after in a stable condition.<ref>{{Cite web |

In 1984 Adams implemented this system on Berkeley Unix 4.2 and dubbed it SLIP.  The SLIP protocol was documented in RFC 1055.\n\nThe SLIP protocol was superseded in the early 1990s, by the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), which is still in use.\n\n=== Founding UUNET ===\nAdams founded a nonprofit telecommunications company, UUNET Communications Service, to reduce the cost of mail and Usenet traffic sent by UUCP, particularly for rural sites in America. (UUNET was founded with a $50,000 loan from the [[USENIX]] Association, which was subsequently repaid.) UUNET became an official gateway between UUCP mail and Internet email, as well as between North America and Europe. It hosted many related services, such as Internet FTP access for its UUCP clients and the comp.sources.unix archives.\n\nAdams spun out a for-profit company, UUNET Technologies, which was the first ISP in the United States.  The for-profit company bought the assets of the nonprofit, repaying it with a share of the profits over the years. The nonprofit has spent that money for many UNIX-related charitable causes over the years, such as supporting the [[Internet Software Consortium]]. The for-profit ISP became a multibillion-dollar company and made an [[initial public offering]] in 1995.  It was acquired by [[Metropolitan Fiber Systems|MFS]] (Metropolitan Fiber Systems, a wide-area optical-networking company), in 1996, which was subsequently acquired by [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], which rose to challenge the largest telecommunications companies in America.\n\nAdams left UUNET after transitioning leadership of the company to [[John Sidgmore]] in 1994.

In 1984 Adams implemented this system on Berkeley Unix 4.2 and dubbed it SLIP.  The SLIP protocol was documented in RFC 1055.\n\nThe SLIP protocol was superseded in the early 1990s, by the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), which is still in use.\n\n=== Founding UUNET ===\nAdams founded a nonprofit telecommunications company, UUNET Communications Service, to reduce the cost of mail and Usenet traffic sent by UUCP, particularly for rural sites in America. (UUNET was founded with a $50,000 loan from the [[USENIX]] Association, which was subsequently repaid.) UUNET became an official gateway between UUCP mail and Internet email, as well as between North America and Europe. It hosted many related services, such as Internet FTP access for its UUCP clients and the comp.sources.unix archives.\n\nAdams spun out a for-profit company, UUNET Technologies, which was the first ISP in the United States.  The for-profit company bought the assets of the nonprofit, repaying it with a share of the profits over the years. The nonprofit has spent that money for many UNIX-related charitable causes over the years, such as supporting the [[Internet Software Consortium]]. The for-profit ISP became a multibillion-dollar company and made an [[initial public offering]] in 1995.  It was acquired by [[Metropolitan Fiber Systems|MFS]] (Metropolitan Fiber Systems, a wide-area optical-networking company), in 1996, which was subsequently acquired by [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], which rose to challenge the largest telecommunications companies in America.\n\nAdams left UUNET after transitioning leadership of the company to [[John Sidgmore]] in 1994. After leaving [[UUNET]], Adams pursued opportunities as a partner in other ventures, including Cello and the 2941 restaurant in [[Falls Church, Virginia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bisnow.com/archives/newsletter/washington-dc/the-biggest-developer-youve-never-heard-of|title=The Biggest Developer You've Never Heard Of!|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bisnow.com|access-date=2017-08-31}}</ref>.\n\n=== Cello Recording Studios ===\nIn 1999 Adams purchased the \"Western Studio\" half of Ocean Way recording studios in Hollywood, California from Alan Sides and renamed it [[United Western Recorders|Cello Studios]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastweststudio.com/history/|title=EastWest Studios : Our History|website=www.eastweststudio.com|access-date=2016-10-25}}</ref> Many of the most famous recording artists of the time worked there including [[Weezer]], [[Rage Against the Machine|Rage Against The Machine]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Blink-182|Blink 182]] and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastweststudio.com/history/|title=EastWest Studios : Our History|website=www.eastweststudio.com|access-date=2016-10-25}}</ref> The business continued under his ownership until it was closed in January 2005.

The College has two campuses: the Junior Campus in [[Norwood, South Australia|Norwood]], containing the Junior School (Reception to Year 6 students) and Early Childhood Centre (3 to 5 years old), and the Senior Campus in [[Athelstone, South Australia|Athelstone]], located across some 16 hectares of land, home to the Senior School (Year 7 to 12 students).<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/the-college/ College. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Single-gender education beginnings and later developments ===\n\nThe College began in Queen Street, [[Norwood, South Australia]], commencing with fifty-two boys and six Jesuit fathers on 13 February 1951. The catalyst was Archbishop [[Matthew Beovich]]'s<ref>[http://www.sosj.org.au/about/south_australia/history.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016004409/http://www.sosj.org.au/about/south_australia/history.html |date=16 October 2009 }}, Sisters of St Joseph, retrieved 2008-10-10.</ref> increasing interest in commencing more formalised Catholic schooling in Adelaide. Thus the Jesuit boys' day school was established. The initial intake was from Grade 3 onwards. Students prior to this year level were educated at [[Loreto College, Marryatville|Loreto College]], St Joseph's Memorial School (the local [[Parochial school|parish school]]), or the local [[state school]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe school grew quickly and in 1967 a secondary campus was opened at Athelstone, in the then outer suburbs of [[Adelaide, South Australia]] and the Norwood campus became the Junior School. From 1971, the school accepted [[Kildare College]] enrolments from girls wanting to complete their secondary studies. At that stage, Kildare offered education up to Year 11. In 1996, the school changed to offer co-educational enrolments from Reception to Year 12, the first Jesuit school in the world to do so.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/the-college/ History. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\n=== A co-educational Reception to Year 12 College ===\n\nToday, over 1500 students are enrolled at the College across both the Junior and Senior Schools.<ref>http://www.ignatius.sa.edu.au/</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the College and [[Mercedes College (Adelaide)|Mercedes College]] hosted their inaugural 'Intercollegiate Sports Carnival' ('Intercol'). Each year the senior students of both colleges participate in eight sports for nineteen shields in the winter season. The school that wins the majority of the shields is the overall winner of the Carnival and of the 'Mercedes-Ignatius' Shield. Each school alternates the hosting of Intercol each year.\n\nA significant celebration and event within the College community is the annual Patronal Feast Day of Saint Ignatius. A whole school mass is held at the Norwood Parish for current students and staff of the school; it is one of only two events in the College calendar where students from both campuses are gathered in one place. Saint Ignatius' feast day is celebrated on 31 July.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/activities/senior-school-activities/ Senior school activities. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\nAside from Junior and Senior School swimming and sports carnivals, another major event is the school's annual Distribution of Prizes, known as 'Speech Day', which all students from Years 3 to 12 attend. Students from Years 3 to 12 can be acknowledged for achievement in various areas of their schooling life. The 'College Blue' prize is also awarded to any past or present student of the College for extraordinary achievement in their life. It is held at the [[Adelaide Convention Centre]] at the beginning of Term 4 (October/November). The majority of awards are books such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias, as well as a small number of medals and trophies. Future student leaders of the school are announced at this event.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/activities/ Activities. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\nIgnatius Early Years opened in 2009. It is an early childhood education centre located next to the Junior School at Norwood. It is for preschoolers aged 3 to 5 and follows the [[Reggio Emilia approach]] on educational philosophy for children.\n\n=== Recent ===\n\nOpening in March 2010, the [[Edmund Campion|Campion]] Library is a new double-storey library at the Senior School, developed to replace the previous, smaller library building. The Campion Library contains more classrooms to accommodate the growing number of Senior School students, as well as more modern library facilities. Similarly, opening in early 2011, the new Junior School library building replaced the former Junior Campus administration building, and likewise, includes new classrooms for the increasing student population.\n\nIn 2014 the Senior School Performing Arts Centre, a Music and Drama Building, was completed, replacing previous [[portable building|demountable]] Performing Arts buildings. The building houses student classrooms, tutorial and storage rooms, and an auditorium with raked audience seating for over 300 people.<ref>http://www.ignatius.sa.edu.au/news-detail172/the-college/general-news/music-and-drama-building/</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the Caroline Chisholm building was opened. The building is three stories tall with the bottom story being for a reception, student services and a variety of offices for many different people at the school. The second level is a new staff room and the third level is a new versatile learning place for students. This learning space includes a green screen, 'building' workshop as well as a number of interactive classrooms which teachers can book and arrange in the layout they want for their class.\n\n==Headmasters==\n* T Perrott SJ (1951-53)\n* T Barden SJ (1954-61)\n* J McArearvey SJ (1962-64)\n* F Wallace SJ (1965-72)\n* P Hosking SJ (1973-77)\n* G O'Kelly SJ (1978-81)\n* N Olsen SJ (1982-86)\n* M Ryan SJ (1987-94)\n* G O'Kelly SJ (1994-06)\n* R Davoren SJ (2007-13)\n* P Coffey (2018-)\n\n==Sport, notable alumni and popular culture==\n=== Sport ===\nStudents of the College are separated into four houses under a College house system. House members are involved in various musical, pastoral, performing and sporting events alongside participants of their own house and opposing teams.

The College has two campuses: the Junior Campus in [[Norwood, South Australia|Norwood]], containing the Junior School (Reception to Year 6 students) and Early Childhood Centre (3 to 5 years old), and the Senior Campus in [[Athelstone, South Australia|Athelstone]], located across some 16 hectares of land, home to the Senior School (Year 7 to 12 students).<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/the-college/ College.

Thus the Jesuit boys' day school was established. The initial intake was from Grade 3 onwards. Students prior to this year level were educated at [[Loreto College, Marryatville|Loreto College]], St Joseph's Memorial School (the local [[Parochial school|parish school]]), or the local [[state school]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe school grew quickly and in 1967 a secondary campus was opened at Athelstone, in the then outer suburbs of [[Adelaide, South Australia]] and the Norwood campus became the Junior School. From 1971, the school accepted [[Kildare College]] enrolments from girls wanting to complete their secondary studies. At that stage, Kildare offered education up to Year 11. In 1996, the school changed to offer co-educational enrolments from Reception to Year 12, the first Jesuit school in the world to do so.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/the-college/ History. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\n=== A co-educational Reception to Year 12 College ===\n\nToday, over 1500 students are enrolled at the College across both the Junior and Senior Schools.<ref>http://www.ignatius.sa.edu.au/</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the College and [[Mercedes College (Adelaide)|Mercedes College]] hosted their inaugural 'Intercollegiate Sports Carnival' ('Intercol'). Each year the senior students of both colleges participate in eight sports for nineteen shields in the winter season. The school that wins the majority of the shields is the overall winner of the Carnival and of the 'Mercedes-Ignatius' Shield. Each school alternates the hosting of Intercol each year.\n\nA significant celebration and event within the College community is the annual Patronal Feast Day of Saint Ignatius. A whole school mass is held at the Norwood Parish for current students and staff of the school; it is one of only two events in the College calendar where students from both campuses are gathered in one place. Saint Ignatius' feast day is celebrated on 31 July.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/activities/senior-school-activities/ Senior school activities. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\nAside from Junior and Senior School swimming and sports carnivals, another major event is the school's annual Distribution of Prizes, known as 'Speech Day', which all students from Years 3 to 12 attend. Students from Years 3 to 12 can be acknowledged for achievement in various areas of their schooling life. The 'College Blue' prize is also awarded to any past or present student of the College for extraordinary achievement in their life. It is held at the [[Adelaide Convention Centre]] at the beginning of Term 4 (October/November). The majority of awards are books such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias, as well as a small number of medals and trophies. Future student leaders of the school are announced at this event.<ref>[http://ignatius.sa.edu.au/activities/ Activities. Accessed 6 June 2016.]</ref>\n\nIgnatius Early Years opened in 2009. It is an early childhood education centre located next to the Junior School at Norwood. It is for preschoolers aged 3 to 5 and follows the [[Reggio Emilia approach]] on educational philosophy for children.\n\n=== Recent ===\n\nOpening in March 2010, the [[Edmund Campion|Campion]] Library is a new double-storey library at the Senior School, developed to replace the previous, smaller library building. The Campion Library contains more classrooms to accommodate the growing number of Senior School students, as well as more modern library facilities. Similarly, opening in early 2011, the new Junior School library building replaced the former Junior Campus administration building, and likewise, includes new classrooms for the increasing student population.\n\nIn 2014 the Senior School Performing Arts Centre, a Music and Drama Building, was completed, replacing previous [[portable building|demountable]] Performing Arts buildings. The building houses student classrooms, tutorial and storage rooms, and an auditorium with raked audience seating for over 300 people.<ref>http://www.ignatius.sa.edu.au/news-detail172/the-college/general-news/music-and-drama-building/</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the Caroline Chisholm building was opened. The building is three stories tall with the bottom story being for a reception, student services and a variety of offices for many different people at the school. The second level is a new staff room and the third level is a new versatile learning place for students. This learning space includes a green screen, 'building' workshop as well as a number of interactive classrooms which teachers can book and arrange in the layout they want for their class.\n\n==Headmasters==\n* T Perrott SJ (1951-53)\n* T Barden SJ (1954-61)\n* J McArearvey SJ (1962-64)\n* F Wallace SJ (1965-72)\n* P Hosking SJ (1973-77)\n* G O'Kelly SJ (1978-81)\n* N Olsen SJ (1982-86)\n* M Ryan SJ (1987-94)\n* G O'Kelly SJ (1994-06)\n* R Davoren SJ (2007-13)\n* P Coffey (2018-)\n\n==Sport, notable alumni and popular culture==\n=== Sport ===\nStudents of the College are separated into four houses under a College house system.

Because of its [[performance dance|performance]] and [[entertainment]] aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.\n\n''Ballroom dance'' may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any recreational dance with a partner.  However, with the emergence of dance competition (now known as [[Dancesport]]), two principal schools have emerged and the term is used more narrowly to refer to the dances recognized by those schools.\n\n* The International School, originally developed in England<ref name=Franks>Franks A.H. 1963. ''Social dance: a short history''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London.</ref> and now regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] ([https://www.wdcdance.com/ WDC]) and the [[World DanceSport Federation]] ([https://www.worlddancesport.org/ WDSF]), is most prevalent in Europe.  It encompasses two categories, Standard and Latin, each of which consist of five dances\u2014International Waltz, International Tango, International Viennese Waltz, International Slow Foxtrot, and International Quickstep in the Standard category and International Samba, International Cha Cha, International Rumba, International Paso Doble, and International Jive in the Latin category.  A \"Standard\" or \"Latin\" competition encompasses all five dances in the respective category, and a \"Ten Dance\" competition encompasses all ten dances.  The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm, and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness.\n* The American School, also called North American School, is most prevalent in the United States and Canada, where it's regulated by [https://usadance.org/ USA Dance] and Canada Dancesport ([http://www.dancesport.ca/ CDS]) -- the respective national member bodies of the WDSF.  It also consists of two categories analogous to the Standard and Latin categories of the International School, respectively called Smooth and Rhythm.  The Smooth category consists of only four dances\u2014American Waltz, American Tango, American Foxtrot, and American Viennese Waltz, omitting American Peabody (the American School equivalent to Quickstep) -- while the dances selected for competition in the Rhythm category are American Cha Cha, American Rumba, American East Coast Swing (the American School equivalent to International Jive), American Bolero, and American Mambo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dancesport Rulebook 2019 |url=https://cdn.ymaws.com/usadance.org/resource/resmgr/governance/rules/2019a_dancesport_rulebook_ed.pdf |website=USA Dance, Inc. |publisher=USA Dance, Inc. |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=CDS Constitution and Bylaws/Reglement Generaux |url=http://www.dancesport.ca/attachments/File/Rules/2018-19%20CDS%20Rule%20Book%20.pdf |website=Canada Dancesport/Dansesport Canada |publisher=Canada Dancesport/Dansesport Canada |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>  A \"Smooth\" or \"Rhythm\" competition encompasses the dances in the respective category, and a \"Nine Dance\" competition encompassing all nine of these dances is analogous to the \"Ten Dance\" competition of the International School.  USA Dance additionally recognizes American Peabody, American Merengue, American Paso Doble, American Samba, American West Coast Swing, American Polka, and American Hustle as ballroom dances in which sanctioned competition may take place.\n\nNote that dances of the two schools that bear the same name may differ considerably in permitted patterns (figures), technique, and styling.\n\nExhibitions and social situations that feature ballroom dancing also may include additional partner dances such as Lindy Hop, Night Club Two Step, Night Club Swing, Bachata, Country Two Step, and regional (local or national) favorites that normally are not regarded as part of the ballroom family, and a number of historical dances also may be danced in ballrooms or salons.  Additionally, some sources regard Sequence Dancing, in pairs or other formations, to be a style of ballroom dance.<ref>Silvester, Victor 1980. ''Old Time and sequence dancing''. Barrie and Jenkins, London.</ref>\n\n== Definitions and history ==\n[[File:Galliard.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Galliard in [[Siena]], Italy, 15th century]]\nThe term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word ''ball'' which in turn originates from the Latin word ''ballare'' which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was [[Social dance|social dancing]] for the privileged, leaving [[folk dancing]] for the lower classes. These boundaries have since become blurred. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the [[Minuet]], [[Quadrille]], [[Polonaise (dance)|Polonaise]], [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], and others, which are now considered to be [[historical dance]]s.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThe first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name \"[[Thoinot Arbeau|Thoinot-Arbeau]]\", published in 1588 his ''Orch\u00e9sographie'', a study of late 16th-century French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn [[basse danse]], the livelier [[branle]], [[pavane]], and the [[galliarde]] which [[Shakespeare]] called the \"cinq pace\" as it was made of five steps.<ref name=silvester/>\n\nIn 1650 the [[Minuet]], originally a peasant dance of [[Poitou]], was introduced into Paris and set to music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and danced by the King [[Louis XIV]] in public. The Minuet dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.\n\nToward the later half of the 16th century, Louis XIV founded his '[[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique|Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique et de Danse]]', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the \"[[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions]]\" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Acad\u00e9mie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turned out]] positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.<ref name=silvester />\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Vernon and Irene Castle2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], early ballroom dance pioneers, c. 1910\u201318]]\nThe waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 [[Carl Maria von Weber]] wrote ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened.<ref name=silvester>Silvester, Victor 1993. ''Modern Ballroom Dancing''; rev. ed. London: Stanley Paul. (1st edition: London: H. Jenkins, 1927)</ref> In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the [[polka]], [[mazurka]], and the [[Schottische]]. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as ''entrechats'' and ''ronds de jambes'' that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nModern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as [[jazz]]. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910\u20131930.\n\nThe third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe. Here [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including [[Josephine Bradley]] and [[Victor Silvester]]. These professionals analysed, codified, published, and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge [[Arthur Murray]] organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.<ref name=Franks/><ref>Richardson P.J S. 1948. ''The history of English ballroom dancing (1900\u20131945)''. London: Jenkins</ref>\n\nLater, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] influenced all forms of dance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm |title=History of Musical Film, by John Kenrick |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=Musicals101.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172708/http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980215/REVIEWS08/401010363/1023 |title=Review of \"Swing Time\" (1936) |date=1998-02-15 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503164308/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19980215%2FREVIEWS08%2F401010363%2F1023 |archivedate=2008-05-03 }}</ref>\n\n== Competitive dancing ==\n{{Main|Dancesport}}\n[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha 3.jpg|thumb|right|Young couple dancing [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] at a junior Latin dance competition in the [[Czech Republic]]]]\n\nCompetitions, sometimes referred to as [[dancesport]], range from world championships, regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels.

Australian [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] is danced both competitively and socially. In competition, there are 15 recognized New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognized internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.\n\nInternationally, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], hosted annually at [[Blackpool]], England is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.\n\n[[Formation dance]] is another style of competitive dance recognized by the WDSF. In this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.\n\n=== Elements of competition ===\n[[File:MIT 2006 Latin Intermediate.jpg|thumb|Intermediate level international style Latin dancing at the 2006 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ballroom dance competition. A judge stands in the foreground.]]\n\nIn competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers\u2014called scrutineers\u2014will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals when the [[Skating system]] is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1\u20136, though the number of couples in the final may vary. Sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.\n\nCompetitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. The levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. The syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold\u2014with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. In these levels, moves are restricted to those written in a syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. Each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. There are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. At those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.\n\n=== Medal evaluations ===\nMedal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD) and the [[United Kingdom Alliance (UKA)]], each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD and UKA also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country & Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-championship, and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.\n\n== Collegiate ballroom ==\n[[File:Colligate ballroom.jpg|right|thumb|People on the dance floor waiting to dance and compete.]]\nThere is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. These chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. Teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. Ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. There is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. There is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ballroom 101|url=http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|publisher=USA Dance, Inc.|accessdate=9 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155208/http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|archivedate=13 April 2014}}</ref> These competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. Examples include the MIT Open Ballroom Dance Competition, Purdue Ballroom Classic, Cardinal Classic, Berkeley Classic, and Harvard Invitational.\n\n== Dances ==\n\"Ballroom dance\" refers most often to the ten dances of '''Standard''' and '''Latin''', though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/%7Edon/pubs/modern.html| title= History of Modern Ballroom Dancing| accessdate= 2007-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070226125005/http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~don/pubs/modern.html| archivedate= 26 February 2007| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}.</ref> [[Sequence dancing]], which is danced predominantly in the United Kingdom, and its development [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] in Australia and New Zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the '''American Style''' ('''American Smooth''' and '''American Rhythm''') also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only [[Ballroom glossary#Closed position|closed dance positions]], whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.\n\nOther dances sometimes placed under the umbrella \"ballroom dance\" include nightclub dances such as [[Lindy Hop]], [[West Coast swing]], [[nightclub two step]], [[Hustle (dance)|hustle]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], and [[merengue (dance)|merengue]]. The categorization of dances as \"ballroom dances\" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the [[vintage dance]] movement.\n\nIn Europe, Latin Swing dances include [[Argentine tango]], [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], [[Lindy Hop]], swing boogie (sometimes also known as nostalgic boogie), and [[discofox]]. One example of this is the subcategory of [[cajun dance]]s that originated in [[Acadiana]], with branches reaching both coasts of the United States.\n\nStandard/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the [[Ballroom glossary#Line of dance|line of dance]]. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a [[white tie]] affair, with full gowns for the ladies and [[bow tie]] and [[tail coat]]s for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]]s, vests, and other creative outfits.\n\nLatin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music and (in case of jive) Western music. With the exception of a few traveling dances like [[Samba (ballroom)|samba]] and [[pasodoble]], couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted Latin outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.\n\n== Competitive dances ==\n[[File:Tango ballroom standard.png|thumb|180px|Victor Fung and Anna Mikhed dancing a [[Tango (ballroom)|tango]] in 2006. The couple, dancing for the US, came third in the Professional [[World Ballroom Dance Championship|World Championship]] 2009.]]\n\n===Standard/Smooth===\n==== Waltz ====\n{{Main|Waltz (International Standard)}}\nWaltz began as a country folk dance in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] in the 17th century. In the early 19th century it was introduced in England. It was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. When performing the dance, the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, follow's body leaves the right side of the lead while the head is extended to follow the elbow. Figures with rotation have little rise. The start of the rise begins slowly from the first count, peaks on the 2nd count and lowers slowly on the 3rd. Sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing the feet together. Waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\n==== Viennese Waltz ====\n{{Main|Viennese Waltz}}\nViennese waltz originated in [[Provence]] area in France in 1559 and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. It was introduced in England as German waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]. It is often referred to as the classic \u201cold-school\u201d ballroom. Viennese Waltz music is quite fast. Slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. Reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. While natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. Viennese waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|title=International Style - DanceCentral.info|website=www.dancecentral.info|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514234052/http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|archivedate=2017-05-14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|title=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|website=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505151122/http://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|archivedate=2017-05-05}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|title=Just Dance Ballroom :: Dance Styles|website=www.justdanceballroom.com|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429183138/http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|archivedate=2017-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==== Tango ====\n{{Main|Tango}}\nTango originated in [[Buenos Aires]] in the late 19th century. Modern [[Argentine tango]] is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the lead and follow moving in harmony of the tango's passionate charging music. The tango's technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. Tango is a flat-footed dance and unlike the other dances, has no rise and fall. Body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the dancers in the hips.\n\n[[Ballroom tango]], however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and [[staccato]] movements. Ballroom tango, rather than Argentine tango, is performed in international competition.\n\n==== Foxtrot ====\n{{Main|Foxtrot}}\nThe foxtrot is an American dance, believed to be of African-American origin. It was named by a [[vaudeville]] performer [[Harry Fox]] in 1914. Fox was rapidly trotting step to [[ragtime]] music. The dance therefore was originally named as the \u201cFox\u2019s trot\u201d. The foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. The partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. The dance is flat, with no rise and fall. The walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. Foxtrot is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\n==== Quickstep ====\n{{Main|Quickstep}}\nThe quickstep is an English dance and was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]. It is a fast moving dance, so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. Quickstep includes the walks, runs, chasses, and turns of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, run, quick step, jump and skips. Quick step is performed as an International Standard dance.\n\n===Latin/Rhythm===\n==== Pasodoble ====\n{{Main|Pasodoble}}\nThe pasodoble originated from Spain and its dramatic bullfights. The dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially because of its many choreographic rules. The lead plays the role of the [[Bullfighter|matador]] while the follow takes the role of the matador's cape, the bull, or even the matador. The chassez cape refers to the lead using the follow to turn them as if they are the cape, and the apel is when the lead stomps their foot to get the bull's attention. Pasodoble is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\n==== Spanish bolero ====\n{{Main|Bolero (Spanish dance)}}\nThe Spanish bolero was developed in the late 18th century out of the ''[[seguidilla]]'', and its popularization is attributed to court dancers such as [[Sebastiano Carezo|Sebasti\u00e1n Cerezo]]. It became one of the most popular ballroom dances of the 19th century and saw many classical adaptations. However, by the 20th century it had become old-fashioned. A Cuban music genre of the same name, [[bolero]], which became popular in the early 20th century, is unrelated to the Spanish dance.\n\n====Cuban bolero====\n{{Main|Bolero}}\nAlthough Cuban bolero was born as a form of ''[[trova]]'', traditional singer/songwriter tradition from eastern Cuba, with no associated dance, it soon became a ballroom favorite in Cuba and all of Latin America. The dance most commonly represents the couple falling in love. Modern bolero is seen as a combination of many dances: like a slow salsa with contra-body movement of tango, patterns of rhumba, and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. Bolero can be danced in a closed hold or singly and then coming back together. It is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\n==== Samba ====\n{{Main|Samba (Brazilian dance)}}\nSamba is the national dance of [[Brazil]]. The rhythm of samba and its name originated from the language and culture of West African slaves. In 1905, samba became known to other countries during an exhibition in Paris. In the 1940s, samba was introduced in America through [[Carmen Miranda]]. The international version of Ballroom Samba has been based on an early version of Brazilian Samba called Maxixe, but has since developed away and differs strongly from Brazilian Ballroom Samba, which is called Samba de Gafieira. International Ballroom Samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. It is performed as an International Latin dance, although most of its modern development has occurred outside Latin America.\n\n==== Rhumba ====\n{{Main|Rhumba}}\nRhumba came to the United States from Cuba in the 1920s and became a popular [[cabaret]] dance during [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Rhumba is a ballroom adaptation of [[son cubano]] and [[bolero]] (the Cuban genre) and, despite its name, it rarely included elements of [[Cuban rumba]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=Yvonne|editor1-last=Malnig|editor1-first=Julie|title=Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago, IL|page=162|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zCSDBjRqC5EC|chapter=Rumba Then and Now}}</ref> It includes Cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure-eight hip rotation, and swiveling foot action. An important characteristic of rhumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. Rhumba is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\n==== Mambo ====\n{{Main|Mambo (dance)}}\nMambo was developed as an offshoot of [[danz\u00f3n]], the national dance of Cuba, in the late 1930s by [[Orestes L\u00f3pez]] and his brother [[Cachao]], of [[Arca\u00f1o y sus Maravillas]]. They conceived a new form of danz\u00f3n influenced by [[son cubano]], with a faster, improvised final section, which allowed dancers to more freely express themselves, given that danz\u00f3n had traditionally a very rigid structure. In the 1940s, [[D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado]] transformed the mambo from the charanga into the [[big band]] format, and took it to Mexico and the United States, where it became a \"dance craze\".\n\n==== Cha Cha ====\n{{Main|Cha-cha-cha (dance)}}\nCha Cha (sometimes wrongly called Cha Cha Cha based on a \"street version\" of the dance with shifted timing) was delevoped by [[Enrique Jorr\u00edn]] in the early 1950s, as a slower alternative to Mambo\u2014and, in fact, was originally called Triple Mambo. The Cha Cha is a flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronising their movements. The dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of Cuban motion. Cha-cha is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\n==== East Coast Swing ====\n{{Main|East Coast Swing}}\nSwing in 1927 was originally named the [[Lindy Hop]] named by [[George Snowden|Shorty George Snowden]]. There have been 40 different versions documented over the years; most common is the East Coast swing which is performed in the American Smooth (or American Rhythm) only in the U.S. or Canada. The East Coast swing was established by Arthur Murray and others only shortly after World War II. Swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. The swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. Swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. East Coast swing is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\n==== Jive ====\n{{Main|Jive (dance)}}\nThe jive is part of the [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] group and is a very lively variation of the [[jitterbug]]. Jive originated from African American clubs in the early 1940s. During World War II, American soldiers introduced the jive in England where it was adapted to today's competitive jive. In jive, the man leads the dance while the woman encourages the man to ask them to dance. It is danced to [[big band]] music, and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. Jive is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\n== Dance style classification ==\n=== {{anchor|International Style}} International Style competition dances ===\n\nAccording to [[World Dance Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910165950/http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====Standard====\n'''[[Waltz (International Standard)|Waltz]]''':\n28 bars per minute, {{music|time|3|4}} time, also known as ''Slow Waltz'' or ''English Waltz'' depending on locality\n\n'''[[Ballroom tango|Tango]]''':\n32 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Viennese Waltz]]''':\n60 bars per minute, {{music|time|3|4}} time.\nOn the European continent, the Viennese waltz is known simply as ''waltz'', while the [[waltz]] is recognized as ''English waltz'' or ''Slow Waltz''.\n\n'''[[Foxtrot]]''':\n28 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Quickstep]]''':\n50 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n====Latin====\n'''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha-cha]]''':\n30 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Samba (ballroom)|Samba]]''':\n48 bars per minute, {{music|time|2|4}} time\n\n'''[[Rhumba|Rumba]]''':\n24 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Paso Doble]]''':\n56 bars per minute, {{music|time|2|4}} time\n\n'''[[Jive (dance)|Jive]]''':\n42 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n=== American Style competition dances (only in the U.S. & Canada) ===\n\n====Smooth====\n'''[[Waltz]]''':\n29\u201330 bars per minute\n30\u201332 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Ballroom tango|Tango]]''':\n60 bars per minute\n30\u201332 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]''':\n30 bars per minute\n32\u201334 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Viennese Waltz]]''':\n53\u201354 bars per minute\n54 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n====Rhythm====\n'''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha Cha]]''':\n30 bars per minute\n\n'''[[Rhumba|Rumba]]''':\n30\u201332 bars per minute\n32\u201336 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[East Coast Swing]]''':\n36 bars per minute\n34\u201336 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Bolero]]''':\n24 bars per minute\n24\u201326 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Mambo dance|Mambo]]''':\n47 bars per minute\n48\u201351 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n=== Others ===\nHistorical/Vintage Ballroom dance:\n:[[Waltz]] \u2013 [[Polka]] \u2013 [[Schottische]] \u2013 [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] \u2013 [[One-Step]] \u2013 [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]] \u2013 [[Peabody (dance)|Peabody]]\n\nOther dances occasionally categorized as ballroom:\n\n: '''Nightclub'''\n:[[Nightclub Two-step]] \u2013 [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]] \u2013 [[Modern Jive]] / [[LeRoc]] / [[Ceroc]] \u2013 and the whole swing variety: [[West Coast Swing]] / [[East Coast Swing]]/ [[Lindy Hop]] (always included in the \"Rhythm-Swing\" category) / [[Carolina Shag]] / [[Collegiate Shag]] / [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]] / [[Blues]] \u2013 [[Fusion dance|Fusion]]\n\n: '''Latin nightclub'''\n:[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] \u2013 [[Cumbia]] \u2013 [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]] \u2013 [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]] \u2013 [[Porro]] \u2013 [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha cha]] \u2013 [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata]]\n\n: '''African nightclub'''\n:[[Kizomba]] \u2013 [[Semba]] \u2013 [[Zouk]]\n\n: '''Brazilian Dances'''\n:[[Forr\u00f3]] \u2013 [[Pagode]] \u2013 [[Samba de Gafieira]] \u2013 [[Lambada]] -

Because of its [[performance dance|performance]] and [[entertainment]] aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.\n\n''Ballroom dance'' may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any recreational dance with a partner.  However, with the emergence of dance competition (now known as [[Dancesport]]), two principal schools have emerged and the term is used more narrowly to refer to the dances recognized by those schools.\n\n* The International School, originally developed in England<ref name=Franks>Franks A.H. 1963. ''Social dance: a short history''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London.</ref> and now regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] ([https://www.wdcdance.com/ WDC]) and the [[World DanceSport Federation]] ([https://www.worlddancesport.org/ WDSF]), is most prevalent in Europe.  It encompasses two categories, Standard and Latin, each of which consist of five dances\u2014International Waltz, International Tango, International Viennese Waltz, International Slow Foxtrot, and International Quickstep in the Standard category and International Samba, International Cha Cha, International Rumba, International Paso Doble, and International Jive in the Latin category.  A \"Standard\" or \"Latin\" competition encompasses all five dances in the respective category, and a \"Ten Dance\" competition encompasses all ten dances.  The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm, and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness.\n* The American School, also called North American School, is most prevalent in the United States and Canada, where it's regulated by [https://usadance.org/ USA Dance] and Canada Dancesport ([http://www.dancesport.ca/ CDS]) -- the respective national member bodies of the WDSF.  It also consists of two categories analogous to the Standard and Latin categories of the International School, respectively called Smooth and Rhythm.  The Smooth category consists of only four dances\u2014American Waltz, American Tango, American Foxtrot, and American Viennese Waltz, omitting American Peabody (the American School equivalent to Quickstep) -- while the dances selected for competition in the Rhythm category are American Cha Cha, American Rumba, American East Coast Swing (the American School equivalent to International Jive), American Bolero, and American Mambo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dancesport Rulebook 2019 |url=https://cdn.ymaws.com/usadance.org/resource/resmgr/governance/rules/2019a_dancesport_rulebook_ed.pdf |website=USA Dance, Inc. |publisher=USA Dance, Inc. |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=CDS Constitution and Bylaws/Reglement Generaux |url=http://www.dancesport.ca/attachments/File/Rules/2018-19%20CDS%20Rule%20Book%20.pdf |website=Canada Dancesport/Dansesport Canada |publisher=Canada Dancesport/Dansesport Canada |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>  A \"Smooth\" or \"Rhythm\" competition encompasses the dances in the respective category, and a \"Nine Dance\" competition encompassing all nine of these dances is analogous to the \"Ten Dance\" competition of the International School.  USA Dance additionally recognizes American Peabody, American Merengue, American Paso Doble, American Samba, American West Coast Swing, American Polka, and American Hustle as ballroom dances in which sanctioned competition may take place.\n\nNote that dances of the two schools that bear the same name may differ considerably in permitted patterns (figures), technique, and styling.\n\nExhibitions and social situations that feature ballroom dancing also may include additional partner dances such as Lindy Hop, Night Club Two Step, Night Club Swing, Bachata, Country Two Step, and regional (local or national) favorites that normally are not regarded as part of the ballroom family, and a number of historical dances also may be danced in ballrooms or salons.  Additionally, some sources regard Sequence Dancing, in pairs or other formations, to be a style of ballroom dance.<ref>Silvester, Victor 1980. ''Old Time and sequence dancing''. Barrie and Jenkins, London.</ref>\n\n== Definitions and history ==\n[[File:Galliard.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Galliard in [[Siena]], Italy, 15th century]]\nThe term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word ''ball'' which in turn originates from the Latin word ''ballare'' which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was [[Social dance|social dancing]] for the privileged, leaving [[folk dancing]] for the lower classes. These boundaries have since become blurred. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the [[Minuet]], [[Quadrille]], [[Polonaise (dance)|Polonaise]], [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], and others, which are now considered to be [[historical dance]]s.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThe first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name \"[[Thoinot Arbeau|Thoinot-Arbeau]]\", published in 1588 his ''Orch\u00e9sographie'', a study of late 16th-century French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn [[basse danse]], the livelier [[branle]], [[pavane]], and the [[galliarde]] which [[Shakespeare]] called the \"cinq pace\" as it was made of five steps.<ref name=silvester/>\n\nIn 1650 the [[Minuet]], originally a peasant dance of [[Poitou]], was introduced into Paris and set to music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and danced by the King [[Louis XIV]] in public. The Minuet dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.\n\nToward the later half of the 16th century, Louis XIV founded his '[[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique|Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique et de Danse]]', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the \"[[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions]]\" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Acad\u00e9mie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turned out]] positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.<ref name=silvester />\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Vernon and Irene Castle2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], early ballroom dance pioneers, c. 1910\u201318]]\nThe waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 [[Carl Maria von Weber]] wrote ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened.<ref name=silvester>Silvester, Victor 1993. ''Modern Ballroom Dancing''; rev. ed. London: Stanley Paul. (1st edition: London: H. Jenkins, 1927)</ref> In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the [[polka]], [[mazurka]], and the [[Schottische]]. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as ''entrechats'' and ''ronds de jambes'' that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nModern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as [[jazz]]. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910\u20131930.\n\nThe third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe. Here [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including [[Josephine Bradley]] and [[Victor Silvester]]. These professionals analysed, codified, published, and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge [[Arthur Murray]] organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.<ref name=Franks/><ref>Richardson P.J S. 1948. ''The history of English ballroom dancing (1900\u20131945)''. London: Jenkins</ref>\n\nLater, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] influenced all forms of dance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm |title=History of Musical Film, by John Kenrick |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=Musicals101.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172708/http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980215/REVIEWS08/401010363/1023 |title=Review of \"Swing Time\" (1936) |date=1998-02-15 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503164308/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19980215%2FREVIEWS08%2F401010363%2F1023 |archivedate=2008-05-03 }}</ref>\n\n== Competitive dancing ==\n{{Main|Dancesport}}\n[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha 3.jpg|thumb|right|Young couple dancing [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] at a junior Latin dance competition in the [[Czech Republic]]]]\n\nCompetitions, sometimes referred to as [[dancesport]], range from world championships, regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA [[pro-am]] competitions typically accompany professional competitions.<ref>[http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ USDC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000126/http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ |date=2007-03-11 }}</ref> The [[International Olympic Committee]] now recognizes [[competitive dance|competitive]] ballroom dance.<ref>[http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 Certificate of Olympic recognition of WDSF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010044/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 |date=2010-06-26 }}</ref> It has recognized another body, the [[World DanceSport Federation]] (WDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the [[Olympic Games]]. However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nBallroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. There are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. There are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the WDC and/or the WDSF, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions.<ref>Complete listings of affiliations are given in the programmes of the major competitions.</ref> In Britain there is the [[British Dance Council]], which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the British Ballroom Championships, the [[British Sequence Championships]] and the United Kingdom Championships.

Australian [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] is danced both competitively and socially. In competition, there are 15 recognized New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognized internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.\n\nInternationally, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], hosted annually at [[Blackpool]], England is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.\n\n[[Formation dance]] is another style of competitive dance recognized by the WDSF. In this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.\n\n=== Elements of competition ===\n[[File:MIT 2006 Latin Intermediate.jpg|thumb|Intermediate level international style Latin dancing at the 2006 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ballroom dance competition. A judge stands in the foreground.]]\n\nIn competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers\u2014called scrutineers\u2014will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals when the [[Skating system]] is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1\u20136, though the number of couples in the final may vary. Sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.\n\nCompetitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. The levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. The syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold\u2014with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. In these levels, moves are restricted to those written in a syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. Each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. There are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. At those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.\n\n=== Medal evaluations ===\nMedal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD) and the [[United Kingdom Alliance (UKA)]], each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD and UKA also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country & Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-championship, and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.\n\n== Collegiate ballroom ==\n[[File:Colligate ballroom.jpg|right|thumb|People on the dance floor waiting to dance and compete.]]\nThere is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. These chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. Teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. Ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. There is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. There is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ballroom 101|url=http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|publisher=USA Dance, Inc.|accessdate=9 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155208/http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|archivedate=13 April 2014}}</ref> These competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. Examples include the MIT Open Ballroom Dance Competition, Purdue Ballroom Classic, Cardinal Classic, Berkeley Classic, and Harvard Invitational.\n\n== Dances ==\n\"Ballroom dance\" refers most often to the ten dances of '''Standard''' and '''Latin''', though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/%7Edon/pubs/modern.html| title= History of Modern Ballroom Dancing| accessdate= 2007-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070226125005/http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~don/pubs/modern.html| archivedate= 26 February 2007| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}.</ref> [[Sequence dancing]], which is danced predominantly in the United Kingdom, and its development [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] in Australia and New Zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the '''American Style''' ('''American Smooth''' and '''American Rhythm''') also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only [[Ballroom glossary#Closed position|closed dance positions]], whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.\n\nOther dances sometimes placed under the umbrella \"ballroom dance\" include nightclub dances such as [[Lindy Hop]], [[West Coast swing]], [[nightclub two step]], [[Hustle (dance)|hustle]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], and [[merengue (dance)|merengue]]. The categorization of dances as \"ballroom dances\" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the [[vintage dance]] movement.\n\nIn Europe, Latin Swing dances include [[Argentine tango]], [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], [[Lindy Hop]], swing boogie (sometimes also known as nostalgic boogie), and [[discofox]]. One example of this is the subcategory of [[cajun dance]]s that originated in [[Acadiana]], with branches reaching both coasts of the United States.\n\nStandard/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the [[Ballroom glossary#Line of dance|line of dance]]. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a [[white tie]] affair, with full gowns for the ladies and [[bow tie]] and [[tail coat]]s for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]]s, vests, and other creative outfits.\n\nLatin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music and (in case of jive) Western music. With the exception of a few traveling dances like [[Samba (ballroom)|samba]] and [[pasodoble]], couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted Latin outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.\n\n== Competitive dances ==\n[[File:Tango ballroom standard.png|thumb|180px|Victor Fung and Anna Mikhed dancing a [[Tango (ballroom)|tango]] in 2006. The couple, dancing for the US, came third in the Professional [[World Ballroom Dance Championship|World Championship]] 2009.]]\n\n===Standard/Smooth===\n==== Waltz ====\n{{Main|Waltz (International Standard)}}\nWaltz began as a country folk dance in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] in the 17th century. In the early 19th century it was introduced in England. It was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. When performing the dance, the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, follow's body leaves the right side of the lead while the head is extended to follow the elbow. Figures with rotation have little rise. The start of the rise begins slowly from the first count, peaks on the 2nd count and lowers slowly on the 3rd. Sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing the feet together. Waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\n==== Viennese Waltz ====\n{{Main|Viennese Waltz}}\nViennese waltz originated in [[Provence]] area in France in 1559 and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. It was introduced in England as German waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]. It is often referred to as the classic \u201cold-school\u201d ballroom. Viennese Waltz music is quite fast. Slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. Reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. While natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. Viennese waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|title=International Style - DanceCentral.info|website=www.dancecentral.info|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514234052/http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|archivedate=2017-05-14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|title=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|website=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505151122/http://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|archivedate=2017-05-05}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|title=Just Dance Ballroom :: Dance Styles|website=www.justdanceballroom.com|access-date=2017-05-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429183138/http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|archivedate=2017-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==== Tango ====\n{{Main|Tango}}\nTango originated in [[Buenos Aires]] in the late 19th century. Modern [[Argentine tango]] is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the lead and follow moving in harmony of the tango's passionate charging music. The tango's technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. Tango is a flat-footed dance and unlike the other dances, has no rise and fall. Body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the dancers in the hips.\n\n[[Ballroom tango]], however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and [[staccato]] movements. Ballroom tango, rather than Argentine tango, is performed in international competition.\n\n==== Foxtrot ====\n{{Main|Foxtrot}}\nThe foxtrot is an American dance, believed to be of African-American origin. It was named by a [[vaudeville]] performer [[Harry Fox]] in 1914. Fox was rapidly trotting step to [[ragtime]] music. The dance therefore was originally named as the \u201cFox\u2019s trot\u201d. The foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. The partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. The dance is flat, with no rise and fall. The walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. Foxtrot is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\n==== Quickstep ====\n{{Main|Quickstep}}\nThe quickstep is an English dance and was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]. It is a fast moving dance, so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. Quickstep includes the walks, runs, chasses, and turns of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, run, quick step, jump and skips. Quick step is performed as an International Standard dance.\n\n===Latin/Rhythm===\n==== Pasodoble ====\n{{Main|Pasodoble}}\nThe pasodoble originated from Spain and its dramatic bullfights. The dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially because of its many choreographic rules. The lead plays the role of the [[Bullfighter|matador]] while the follow takes the role of the matador's cape, the bull, or even the matador. The chassez cape refers to the lead using the follow to turn them as if they are the cape, and the apel is when the lead stomps their foot to get the bull's attention. Pasodoble is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\n==== Spanish bolero ====\n{{Main|Bolero (Spanish dance)}}\nThe Spanish bolero was developed in the late 18th century out of the ''[[seguidilla]]'', and its popularization is attributed to court dancers such as [[Sebastiano Carezo|Sebasti\u00e1n Cerezo]]. It became one of the most popular ballroom dances of the 19th century and saw many classical adaptations. However, by the 20th century it had become old-fashioned. A Cuban music genre of the same name, [[bolero]], which became popular in the early 20th century, is unrelated to the Spanish dance.\n\n====Cuban bolero====\n{{Main|Bolero}}\nAlthough Cuban bolero was born as a form of ''[[trova]]'', traditional singer/songwriter tradition from eastern Cuba, with no associated dance, it soon became a ballroom favorite in Cuba and all of Latin America. The dance most commonly represents the couple falling in love. Modern bolero is seen as a combination of many dances: like a slow salsa with contra-body movement of tango, patterns of rhumba, and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. Bolero can be danced in a closed hold or singly and then coming back together. It is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\n==== Samba ====\n{{Main|Samba (Brazilian dance)}}\nSamba is the national dance of [[Brazil]]. The rhythm of samba and its name originated from the language and culture of West African slaves. In 1905, samba became known to other countries during an exhibition in Paris. In the 1940s, samba was introduced in America through [[Carmen Miranda]]. The international version of Ballroom Samba has been based on an early version of Brazilian Samba called Maxixe, but has since developed away and differs strongly from Brazilian Ballroom Samba, which is called Samba de Gafieira. International Ballroom Samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. It is performed as an International Latin dance, although most of its modern development has occurred outside Latin America.\n\n==== Rhumba ====\n{{Main|Rhumba}}\nRhumba came to the United States from Cuba in the 1920s and became a popular [[cabaret]] dance during [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Rhumba is a ballroom adaptation of [[son cubano]] and [[bolero]] (the Cuban genre) and, despite its name, it rarely included elements of [[Cuban rumba]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=Yvonne|editor1-last=Malnig|editor1-first=Julie|title=Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago, IL|page=162|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zCSDBjRqC5EC|chapter=Rumba Then and Now}}</ref> It includes Cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure-eight hip rotation, and swiveling foot action. An important characteristic of rhumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. Rhumba is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\n==== Mambo ====\n{{Main|Mambo (dance)}}\nMambo was developed as an offshoot of [[danz\u00f3n]], the national dance of Cuba, in the late 1930s by [[Orestes L\u00f3pez]] and his brother [[Cachao]], of [[Arca\u00f1o y sus Maravillas]]. They conceived a new form of danz\u00f3n influenced by [[son cubano]], with a faster, improvised final section, which allowed dancers to more freely express themselves, given that danz\u00f3n had traditionally a very rigid structure. In the 1940s, [[D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado]] transformed the mambo from the charanga into the [[big band]] format, and took it to Mexico and the United States, where it became a \"dance craze\".\n\n==== Cha Cha ====\n{{Main|Cha-cha-cha (dance)}}\nCha Cha (sometimes wrongly called Cha Cha Cha based on a \"street version\" of the dance with shifted timing) was delevoped by [[Enrique Jorr\u00edn]] in the early 1950s, as a slower alternative to Mambo\u2014and, in fact, was originally called Triple Mambo. The Cha Cha is a flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronising their movements. The dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of Cuban motion. Cha-cha is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\n==== East Coast Swing ====\n{{Main|East Coast Swing}}\nSwing in 1927 was originally named the [[Lindy Hop]] named by [[George Snowden|Shorty George Snowden]]. There have been 40 different versions documented over the years; most common is the East Coast swing which is performed in the American Smooth (or American Rhythm) only in the U.S. or Canada. The East Coast swing was established by Arthur Murray and others only shortly after World War II. Swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. The swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. Swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. East Coast swing is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\n==== Jive ====\n{{Main|Jive (dance)}}\nThe jive is part of the [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] group and is a very lively variation of the [[jitterbug]]. Jive originated from African American clubs in the early 1940s. During World War II, American soldiers introduced the jive in England where it was adapted to today's competitive jive. In jive, the man leads the dance while the woman encourages the man to ask them to dance. It is danced to [[big band]] music, and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. Jive is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\n== Dance style classification ==\n===  International Style competition dances ===\n\nAccording to [[World Dance Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910165950/http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====Standard====\n'''[[Waltz (International Standard)|Waltz]]''':\n28 bars per minute, {{music|time|3|4}} time, also known as ''Slow Waltz'' or ''English Waltz'' depending on locality\n\n'''[[Ballroom tango|Tango]]''':\n32 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Viennese Waltz]]''':\n60 bars per minute, {{music|time|3|4}} time.\nOn the European continent, the Viennese waltz is known simply as ''waltz'', while the [[waltz]] is recognized as ''English waltz'' or ''Slow Waltz''.\n\n'''[[Foxtrot]]''':\n28 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Quickstep]]''':\n50 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n====Latin====\n'''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha-cha]]''':\n30 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Samba (ballroom)|Samba]]''':\n48 bars per minute, {{music|time|2|4}} time\n\n'''[[Rhumba|Rumba]]''':\n24 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n'''[[Paso Doble]]''':\n56 bars per minute, {{music|time|2|4}} time\n\n'''[[Jive (dance)|Jive]]''':\n42 bars per minute, {{music|time|4|4}} time\n\n=== American Style competition dances (only in the U.S. & Canada) ===\n\n====Smooth====\n'''[[Waltz]]''':\n29\u201330 bars per minute\n30\u201332 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Ballroom tango|Tango]]''':\n60 bars per minute\n30\u201332 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]''':\n30 bars per minute\n32\u201334 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Viennese Waltz]]''':\n53\u201354 bars per minute\n54 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n====Rhythm====\n'''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha Cha]]''':\n30 bars per minute\n\n'''[[Rhumba|Rumba]]''':\n30\u201332 bars per minute\n32\u201336 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[East Coast Swing]]''':\n36 bars per minute\n34\u201336 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Bolero]]''':\n24 bars per minute\n24\u201326 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n'''[[Mambo dance|Mambo]]''':\n47 bars per minute\n48\u201351 bars per minute for Bronze\n\n=== Others ===\nHistorical/Vintage Ballroom dance:\n:[[Waltz]] \u2013 [[Polka]] \u2013 [[Schottische]] \u2013 [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] \u2013 [[One-Step]] \u2013 [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]] \u2013 [[Peabody (dance)|Peabody]]\n\nOther dances occasionally categorized as ballroom:\n\n: '''Nightclub'''\n:[[Nightclub Two-step]] \u2013 [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]] \u2013 [[Modern Jive]] / [[LeRoc]] / [[Ceroc]] \u2013 and the whole swing variety: [[West Coast Swing]] / [[East Coast Swing]]/ [[Lindy Hop]] (always included in the \"Rhythm-Swing\" category) / [[Carolina Shag]] / [[Collegiate Shag]] / [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]] / [[Blues]] \u2013 [[Fusion dance|Fusion]]\n\n: '''Latin nightclub'''\n:[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] \u2013 [[Cumbia]] \u2013 [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]] \u2013 [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]] \u2013 [[Porro]] \u2013 [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha cha]] \u2013 [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata]]\n\n: '''African nightclub'''\n:[[Kizomba]] \u2013 [[Semba]] \u2013 [[Zouk]]\n\n: '''Brazilian Dances'''\n:[[Forr\u00f3]] \u2013 [[Pagode]] \u2013 [[Samba de Gafieira]] \u2013 [[Lambada]] -
