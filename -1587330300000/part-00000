Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release. I was told that the Japanese record label considered the release to be a continuation of the previous contract with \"Riot\", so they did not want to use the V\".<ref name=\"RiotV-int 2014\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/riot-v Interview with Todd Michael Hall], Grande-rock.com retrieved on November 13, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Members ==\n=== Current ===\n* Mike Flyntz \u2013 lead guitar (1989\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* Don Van Stavern \u2013 bass (1986\u20131990, 2008\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* [[Todd Michael Hall]] \u2013 lead vocals (2013\u2013present)\n* Frank Gilchriest \u2013 drums (2003\u20132007, 2014\u2013present)\n* Nick Lee \u2013 rhythm guitar (2014\u2013present)\n\n=== Former===\n;Vocalists\n* [[Guy Speranza]] \u2013 lead vocals (1975\u20131981; died 2003)\n* [[Rhett Forrester]] \u2013 lead vocals (1981\u20131984, 1986; died 1994)\n* [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] \u2013 lead vocals (1986\u20131992, 2008\u20132009, 2010\u20132012)\n* [[Mike DiMeo]] \u2013 lead vocals (1992\u20132004)\n* Mike Tirelli \u2013 lead vocals (2005\u20132007)\n\n;Guitarists\n* [[Mark Reale]] \u2013 lead guitar (1975\u20131984, 1986\u20132012; died 2012)\n* Louie \"L.A.\" Kouvaris \u2013 rhythm guitar (1975\u20131978; died 2020)\n* Rick Ventura \u2013 rhythm guitar (1978\u20131984)\n\n;Bassists\n* Phil Feit \u2013 bass (1975\u20131976, 1979\u20131980)\n* Jimmy Iommi \u2013 bass (1976\u20131979)\n* Kip Leming \u2013 bass (1980\u20131984)\n* Pete Perez \u2013 bass (1990\u20132007)\n\n;Drummers\n* Peter Bitelli \u2013 drums (1975\u20131979)\n* Sandy Slavin \u2013 drums (1979\u20131984, 1986)\n* Mark Edwards \u2013 drums (1986\u20131987)\n* [[Bobby Jarzombek]] \u2013 drums (1987\u20131995, 1997\u20131999, 2008\u20132014)\n* [[John Macaluso]] \u2013 drums (1995\u20131997)\n* Pat Magrath \u2013 drums(1999\u20132000)\n* [[Bobby Rondinelli]] \u2013 drums (2000\u20132002)\n\n;Additional live musicians\n* Randy Coven \u2013 bass (2005\u20132007)\n* Gerard T.

Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release.

Some ancient Greek sources note Orpheus' [[Thracians|Thracian]] origins.<ref>Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 167, while taking note of depictions in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek art]], particularly [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]], that show Orpheus attired as a Greek, often in contrast to those in Thracian dress around him.</ref> The major stories about him are centered on his ability to charm all living things and even stones with his music (the usual scene in [[Orpheus mosaic]]s), his attempt to retrieve his wife [[Eurydice]] from the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], and his death at the hands of the maenads of Dionysus who tired of his mourning for his late wife Eurydice. As an archetype of the inspired singer, Orpheus is one of the most significant figures in the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical mythology]] in [[Western culture]], portrayed or [[allusion|alluded]] to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting.<ref>Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 54ff.</ref>\n\nFor the Greeks, Orpheus was a founder and prophet of the so-called [[Orphism (religion)|\"Orphic\" mysteries]].<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece, Corinth, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.30.2 2.30.2]</ref> He was credited with the composition of the  '''''Orphic Hymns'''''<!--boldfaced per WP:R#PLA--> and the Orphic ''[[Argonautica Orphica| Argonautica]]''. Shrines containing purported [[Relic#Relics in classical antiquity|relics]] of Orpheus were regarded as [[oracle]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nSeveral etymologies for the name ''Orpheus'' have been proposed. A probable suggestion is that it is derived from a hypothetical [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] root ''*h\u2083\u00f3rb\u02b0os'' \"orphan, servant, slave\" and ultimately the verb root ''*h\u2083erb\u02b0-'' \"to change allegiance, status, ownership\".<ref>Cf. \"\u1f48\u03c1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2\" in: ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', ed.

When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his [[lyre]] and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC [[Hellenistic]] [[elegiac]] poet [[Phanocles]], Orpheus loved the young Argonaut [[Boreads|Calais]], \"the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing of his desire, nor was his heart at rest.

While walking among her people, the Cicones, in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a [[satyr]]. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the [[nymph]]s and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus traveled to the [[underworld]]. His music softened the hearts of [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]], who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.\n\nThe story in this form belongs to the time of [[Virgil]], who first introduces the name of [[Aristaeus]] (by the time of Virgil's ''[[Georgics]]'', the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent) and the tragic outcome.<ref>M. Owen Lee, ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics'', State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9.</ref> Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Sym.:section=179d ''Symposium'' 179d].</ref> the infernal gods only \"presented an apparition\" of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he instead mocked the gods by trying to go to Hades to bring her back alive. Since his love was not \"true\"\u2014he did not want to die for love\u2014he was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld, and then by being killed by women. In [[Ovid]]'s account, however, Eurydice's death by a snake bite is incurred while she was dancing with [[naiad]]s on her wedding day.\n\nVirgil wrote in his poem that [[Dryads]] wept from [[Orithyia|Epirus]] and [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] up to the land of the [[Getae]] (north east Danube valley) and even describes him wandering into [[Hyperborea]] and [[Tanais]] (ancient Greek city in the Don river delta)<ref name=\"Virgil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/virgil/geo/geo04.htm|title=The Georgics of Virgil: Fourth Book|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> due to his grief.\n\nThe story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name ''Eurudike'' (\"she whose justice extends widely\") recalls cult-titles attached to [[Persephone]]. According to the theories of poet [[Robert Graves]], the myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend, in which he travels to [[Tartarus]] and charms the goddess [[Hecate]].<ref>[[Robert Graves]], ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, \"Orpheus\", p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe myth theme of not looking back, an essential precaution in [[Jason]]'s raising of [[chthonic]] [[Brimo]] [[Hecate|Hekate]] under [[Medea]]'s guidance,<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', book III: \"Let no footfall or barking of dogs cause you to turn around, lest you ruin everything\", Medea warns Jason; after the dread rite, \"The son of Aison was seized by fear, but even so he did not turn round...\"  (Richard Hunter, translator).</ref> is reflected in the Biblical story of [[Lot (Biblical)|Lot]]'s wife when escaping from [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. More directly, the story of Orpheus is similar to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of [[Adonis]] captive in the underworld. However, the developed form of the Orpheus myth was entwined with the Orphic mystery cults and, later in Rome, with the development of [[Mithraism]] and the cult of [[Sol Invictus]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Head of Orpheus.jpg|upright|thumb|right|''Thracian Girl Carrying the Head of Orpheus on His Lyre'' (1865) by [[Gustave Moreau]]]]\n[[File:Kantharos63.9.jpg|thumb|The Death of Orpheus, detail from a silver [[kantharos]], 420-410 BC, part of the [[Vassil Bojkov Collection|Vassil Bojkov collection]], [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]|263x263px]]\nAccording to a [[Late Antique]] summary of [[Aeschylus]]' lost play ''Bassarids'', Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except the sun, whom he called [[Apollo]].

[[Plato]] in particular tells of a class of vagrant beggar-priests who would go about offering purifications to the rich, a clatter of books by Orpheus and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] in tow.<ref>Plato. ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 364c\u2013d.</ref> Those who were especially devoted to these rituals and poems often practiced [[vegetarianism]] and abstention from sex, and refrained from eating eggs and beans \u2014 which came to be known as the ''Orphikos bios'', or \"Orphic way of life\".<ref>Moore, p. 56: \"the use of eggs and beans was forbidden, for these articles were associated with the worship of the dead\".</ref>\n\nThe [[Derveni papyrus]], found in [[Derveni, Thessaloniki|Derveni]], [[Macedonia (Greece)]] in 1962, contains a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem in hexameters, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher [[Anaxagoras]], written in the second half of the fifth century BC. Fragments of the poem are quoted making it \"the most important new piece of evidence about Greek philosophy and religion to come to light since the Renaissance\".<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-10-29.html | last= Janko| first= Richard |journal= Bryn Mawr Classical Review |year= 2006|editor1-first= K. |editor1-last=Tsantsanoglou |editor2-first= G.M. |editor2-last=Par\u00e1ssoglou |editor3-first=T. |editor3-last= Kouremenos | title= The Derveni Papyrus |location= Florence: Olschki |series= Studi e testi per il 'Corpus dei papiri filosofici greci e latini' |volume= 13}}</ref> The papyrus dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon]], making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript.\n\nThe historian [[William Mitford]] wrote in 1784 that the very earliest form of a higher and more cohesive ancient Greek religion was manifest in the Orphic poems.<ref>Mitford, p. 89: \"But the very early inhabitants of Greece had a religion far less degenerated from original purity. To this curious and interesting fact, abundant testimonies remain. They occur in those poems, of uncertain origin and uncertain date, but unquestionably of great antiquity, which are called the poems of Orpheus or rather the Orphic poems [Note: Particularly in the Hymn to Jupiter, quoted by [[Aristotle]] in the seventh chapter of his Treatise on the World]; and they are found scattered among the writings of the philosophers and historians.\" The idea of a religion \"degenerated from original purity\" expressed an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idealisation of an assumed primitive state that is one connotation of \"[[primitivism]]\" in the [[history of ideas]].</ref> [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] wrote that Orpheus was the founder of [[mystery religions]] and the first to reveal to men the meanings of the initiation rites.<ref>Guthrie, pp. 17\u201318. \"As founder of mystery-religions, Orpheus was first to reveal to men the meaning of the rites of initiation (''teletai''). We read of this in both Plato and Aristophanes (Aristophanes, ''Frogs'', 1032; Plato, ''Republic'', 364e, a passage which suggests that literary authority was made to take the responsibility for the rites)\". Guthrie goes on to write about \"This less worthy but certainly popular side of Orphism is represented for us again by the charms or incantations of Orpheus which we may also read of as early as the fifth century. Our authority is [[Euripides]]. We have already noticed the 'charm on the Thracian tablets' in the ''Alcestis'' and in ''Cyclops'' one of the lazy and frightened Satyrs, unwilling to help Odysseus in the task of driving the burning stake into the single eye of the giant, exclaims: 'But I know a spell of Orpheus, a fine one, which will make the brand step up of its own accord to burn this one-eyed son of Earth' (Euripides, ''Cyclops'' 646 = Kern, test. 83).\"</ref>\n\n==Post-Classical interpretations==\n===Classical music===\nThe Orpheus motif has permeated [[Western culture]] and has been used as a theme in all art forms. Early examples include the [[Breton lai]] ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'' from the early 13th century and musical interpretations like [[Jacapo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' (1600, though titled with his wife's name, the libretto is based entirely upon books X and XI of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and therefore Orpheus' viewpoint is predominant). Subsequent operatic interpretations include [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607), [[Orfeo (Rossi)|Luigi Rossi's L'Orfeo]] (1647), [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s ''[[La descente d'Orph\u00e9e aux enfers]]'' H 488, 1686 (he wrote also a cantata, ''Orph\u00e9e descendant aux enfers'' H 471, 1683), [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1762), [[Joseph Haydn]]'s last opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]], ossia Orfeo ed Euridice'' (1791), [[Franz Liszt]]'s symphonic poem ''Orpheus'' (1854), [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'' (1948) and two operas by [[Harrison Birtwistle]]: ''[[The Mask of Orpheus]]'' (1973\u20131984) and [[The Corridor (opera)|''The Corridor'']] (2009).

[[Poul Anderson]]'s Hugo Award-winning novelette \"[[Goat Song (novelette)|Goat Song]]\", published in 1972, is a retelling of the story of Orpheus in a science fiction setting. Some [[feminism|feminist]] interpretations of the myth give Eurydice greater weight. [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''Orpheus and Eurydice Cycle'' (1976\u201386) deals with the myth, and gives Eurydice a more prominent voice. [[Sarah Ruhl]]'s ''[[Eurydice (Ruhl play)|Eurydice]]'' likewise presents the story of Orpheus' descent to the underworld from Eurydice's perspective. Ruhl removes Orpheus from the center of the story by pairing their romantic love with the paternal love of Eurydice's dead father.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/theater/reviews/19seco.html|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|work=New York Times|authorlink=Charles Isherwood|date=2007-06-19|title=The Power of Memory to Triumph Over Death}}</ref> [[David Almond]]'s 2014 novel, ''[[A Song for Ella Grey]]'', was inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and won the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]] in 2015.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/19/david-almond-wins-guardian-childrens-fiction-prize</ref> \nThe 2014 novel [[Orfeo (novel)|''Orfeo'']] by [[Richard Powers]] is based on Orpheus.{{cn|date=April 2018}}{{clarify|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Dino Buzzati]] adapted the Orpheus motif in his graphic novel ''Poem Strip'' (1969).

[[Jean Cocteau]]'s [[Orphic Trilogy]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), [[Orpheus (film)|''Orpheus'']] (1950) and ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1959)&nbsp;\u2013 was filmed over thirty years, and is based in many ways on the story. [[Philip Glass]] adapted [[Orpheus (film)|the second film]] into the [[chamber opera]] [[Philip Glass#Cocteau trilogy and symphonies|''Orph\u00e9e'']] (1991), part of an homage [[triptych]] to Cocteau. [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]' 1975 film ''[[Evrydiki BA 2O37]]'' is an innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]]. [[Ana\u00efs Mitchell]]'s 2010 folk opera musical ''[[Hadestown]]'' retells the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice with a soundtrack inspired by American blues and jazz, portraying [[Hades]] as the brutal work-boss of an underground mining city. Mitchell, together with director [[Rachel Chavkin]], later adapted her album into a multiple Tony award winning [[Hadestown (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n===Reception===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2020}}\n\nBecause of the pervasiveness of the Orpheus myth, many interpretations are in conversation with previous interpretations as well: [[Pina Bausch]]'s dance-opera ''Orpheus und Euridike'' displays original choreography set to Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice''. [[Baz Luhrmann]], in DVD commentaries for his 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', characterizes the film as, in part, a tale of an Orphic hero (in this case a songwriter) who embarks upon a visit to the underworld (in this case the [[demi-monde]] around Paris' [[Montmartre]]) in search of his fortune and ultimately to attempt the rescue of his doomed love.The film adapts a widely known piece from [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s comedic operetta ''Orph\u00e9e aux enfers'' (''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''), identified with the once-popular [[can-can]] music hall dance. Offenbach's operatic work had itself parodied the classical tale of Orpheus' attempted rescue of Eurydice from Pluto (Hades). [[Gavin Bryars]]' music for [[\u00c9douard Lock]]'s full length ballet ''Dido and Orfeo'' (2011) reworks music from the operas ''Dido and Aeneas'' (Purcell) and ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' (Gluck) for a small ensemble of saxophone, viola, cello and piano. In 2019, [[Sara Bareilles]] released her sixth studio album ''[[Amidst the Chaos]]'' which features a song titled \"Orpheus\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aornum]]\n* ''[[Argonautica Orphica]]''\n* [[Katabasis]]\n* [[Leibethra]]\n* [[List of Orphean operas]]\n* [[Pierian Spring]]\n* [[Pimpleia]]\n* [[Sir Orfeo]]\n* [[3361 Orpheus]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' I, iii, 2; ix, 16 & 25;\n* [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' I, 23\u201334; IV, 891\u2013909.\n* Bernab\u00e9, Albertus (ed.), ''Orphicorum et Orphicis similium testimonia et fragmenta.

When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his [[lyre]] and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC [[Hellenistic]] [[elegiac]] poet [[Phanocles]], Orpheus loved the young Argonaut [[Boreads|Calais]], \"the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing of his desire, nor was his heart at rest.

While walking among her people, the Cicones, in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a [[satyr]]. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the [[nymph]]s and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus traveled to the [[underworld]]. His music softened the hearts of [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]], who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.\n\nThe story in this form belongs to the time of [[Virgil]], who first introduces the name of [[Aristaeus]] (by the time of Virgil's ''[[Georgics]]'', the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent) and the tragic outcome.<ref>M. Owen Lee, ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics'', State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9.</ref> Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Sym.:section=179d ''Symposium'' 179d].</ref> the infernal gods only \"presented an apparition\" of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he instead mocked the gods by trying to go to Hades to bring her back alive. Since his love was not \"true\"\u2014he did not want to die for love\u2014he was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld, and then by being killed by women. In [[Ovid]]'s account, however, Eurydice's death by a snake bite is incurred while she was dancing with [[naiad]]s on her wedding day.\n\nVirgil wrote in his poem that [[Dryads]] wept from [[Orithyia|Epirus]] and [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] up to the land of the [[Getae]] (north east Danube valley) and even describes him wandering into [[Hyperborea]] and [[Tanais]] (ancient Greek city in the Don river delta)<ref name=\"Virgil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/virgil/geo/geo04.htm|title=The Georgics of Virgil: Fourth Book|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> due to his grief.\n\nThe story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name ''Eurudike'' (\"she whose justice extends widely\") recalls cult-titles attached to [[Persephone]]. According to the theories of poet [[Robert Graves]], the myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend, in which he travels to [[Tartarus]] and charms the goddess [[Hecate]].<ref>[[Robert Graves]], ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, \"Orpheus\", p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe myth theme of not looking back, an essential precaution in [[Jason]]'s raising of [[chthonic]] [[Brimo]] [[Hecate|Hekate]] under [[Medea]]'s guidance,<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', book III: \"Let no footfall or barking of dogs cause you to turn around, lest you ruin everything\", Medea warns Jason; after the dread rite, \"The son of Aison was seized by fear, but even so he did not turn round...\"  (Richard Hunter, translator).</ref> is reflected in the Biblical story of [[Lot (Biblical)|Lot]]'s wife when escaping from [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. More directly, the story of Orpheus is similar to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of [[Adonis]] captive in the underworld. However, the developed form of the Orpheus myth was entwined with the Orphic mystery cults and, later in Rome, with the development of [[Mithraism]] and the cult of [[Sol Invictus]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Head of Orpheus.jpg|upright|thumb|right|''Thracian Girl Carrying the Head of Orpheus on His Lyre'' (1865) by [[Gustave Moreau]]]]\n[[File:Kantharos63.9.jpg|thumb|The Death of Orpheus, detail from a silver [[kantharos]], 420-410 BC, part of the [[Vassil Bojkov Collection|Vassil Bojkov collection]], [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]|263x263px]]\nAccording to a [[Late Antique]] summary of [[Aeschylus]]' lost play ''Bassarids'', Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except the sun, whom he called [[Apollo]].

Orpheus' soul returned to the underworld, to the fields of the Blessed, where he was reunited at last with his beloved Eurydice. \n\nAnother legend places his tomb at Dion,<ref name=\"L. Alderlink page 32\" /> near [[Pydna]] in [[Macedon]]. In another version of the myth, Orpheus travels to [[Aornum]] in [[Thesprotia]], [[Epirus]] to an old oracle for the dead. In the end Orpheus commits suicide from his grief unable to find Eurydice.<ref>Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydice followed him, but turning round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The Thracians say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of Orpheus sing more sweetly and louder than others.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1].</ref>\n\nAnother account relates that he was struck with lightning by [[Zeus]] for having lied about the stories and the mysteries of the gods.\n\n==Orphic poems and rites<!--linked from 'Orphism (religion)', 'Orphic Hymns', and 'Orphic hymns'-->==\n[[File:Nymphs finding the Head of Orpheus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus'' (1900) by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]\n{{Main article|Orphism (religion)}}\n\nA number of Greek religious poems in [[hexameter]]s were attributed to Orpheus, as they were to similar miracle-working figures, like [[Bakis]], [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], [[Abaris]], [[Aristeas]], [[Epimenides]], and the [[Sibyl]]. Of this vast literature, only two works survived whole: the ''Orphic Hymns'', a set of 87 poems, possibly composed at some point in the second or third century, and the epic poem ''[[Argonautica Orphica|Argonautica]]'', composed somewhere between the fourth and sixth centuries. Earlier Orphic literature, which may date back as far as the sixth century BC, survives only in [[papyrus]] fragments or in quotations. Some of the earliest fragments may have been composed by [[Onomacritus]].<ref>Freeman, Kathleen.

[[Plato]] in particular tells of a class of vagrant beggar-priests who would go about offering purifications to the rich, a clatter of books by Orpheus and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] in tow.<ref>Plato. ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 364c\u2013d.</ref> Those who were especially devoted to these rituals and poems often practiced [[vegetarianism]] and abstention from sex, and refrained from eating eggs and beans \u2014 which came to be known as the ''Orphikos bios'', or \"Orphic way of life\".<ref>Moore, p. 56: \"the use of eggs and beans was forbidden, for these articles were associated with the worship of the dead\".</ref>\n\nThe [[Derveni papyrus]], found in [[Derveni, Thessaloniki|Derveni]], [[Macedonia (Greece)]] in 1962, contains a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem in hexameters, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher [[Anaxagoras]], written in the second half of the fifth century BC. Fragments of the poem are quoted making it \"the most important new piece of evidence about Greek philosophy and religion to come to light since the Renaissance\".<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-10-29.html | last= Janko| first= Richard |journal= Bryn Mawr Classical Review |year= 2006|editor1-first= K. |editor1-last=Tsantsanoglou |editor2-first= G.M. |editor2-last=Par\u00e1ssoglou |editor3-first=T. |editor3-last= Kouremenos | title= The Derveni Papyrus |location= Florence: Olschki |series= Studi e testi per il 'Corpus dei papiri filosofici greci e latini' |volume= 13}}</ref> The papyrus dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon]], making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript.\n\nThe historian [[William Mitford]] wrote in 1784 that the very earliest form of a higher and more cohesive ancient Greek religion was manifest in the Orphic poems.<ref>Mitford, p. 89: \"But the very early inhabitants of Greece had a religion far less degenerated from original purity. To this curious and interesting fact, abundant testimonies remain. They occur in those poems, of uncertain origin and uncertain date, but unquestionably of great antiquity, which are called the poems of Orpheus or rather the Orphic poems [Note: Particularly in the Hymn to Jupiter, quoted by [[Aristotle]] in the seventh chapter of his Treatise on the World]; and they are found scattered among the writings of the philosophers and historians.\" The idea of a religion \"degenerated from original purity\" expressed an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idealisation of an assumed primitive state that is one connotation of \"[[primitivism]]\" in the [[history of ideas]].</ref> [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] wrote that Orpheus was the founder of [[mystery religions]] and the first to reveal to men the meanings of the initiation rites.<ref>Guthrie, pp. 17\u201318. \"As founder of mystery-religions, Orpheus was first to reveal to men the meaning of the rites of initiation (''teletai''). We read of this in both Plato and Aristophanes (Aristophanes, ''Frogs'', 1032; Plato, ''Republic'', 364e, a passage which suggests that literary authority was made to take the responsibility for the rites)\". Guthrie goes on to write about \"This less worthy but certainly popular side of Orphism is represented for us again by the charms or incantations of Orpheus which we may also read of as early as the fifth century. Our authority is [[Euripides]]. We have already noticed the 'charm on the Thracian tablets' in the ''Alcestis'' and in ''Cyclops'' one of the lazy and frightened Satyrs, unwilling to help Odysseus in the task of driving the burning stake into the single eye of the giant, exclaims: 'But I know a spell of Orpheus, a fine one, which will make the brand step up of its own accord to burn this one-eyed son of Earth' (Euripides, ''Cyclops'' 646 = Kern, test. 83).\"</ref>\n\n==Post-Classical interpretations==\n===Classical music===\nThe Orpheus motif has permeated [[Western culture]] and has been used as a theme in all art forms. Early examples include the [[Breton lai]] ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'' from the early 13th century and musical interpretations like [[Jacapo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' (1600, though titled with his wife's name, the libretto is based entirely upon books X and XI of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and therefore Orpheus' viewpoint is predominant). Subsequent operatic interpretations include [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607), [[Orfeo (Rossi)|Luigi Rossi's L'Orfeo]] (1647), [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s ''[[La descente d'Orph\u00e9e aux enfers]]'' H 488, 1686 (he wrote also a cantata, ''Orph\u00e9e descendant aux enfers'' H 471, 1683), [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1762), [[Joseph Haydn]]'s last opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]], ossia Orfeo ed Euridice'' (1791), [[Franz Liszt]]'s symphonic poem ''Orpheus'' (1854), [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'' (1948) and two operas by [[Harrison Birtwistle]]: ''[[The Mask of Orpheus]]'' (1973\u20131984) and [[The Corridor (opera)|''The Corridor'']] (2009).

[[Ana\u00efs Mitchell]]'s 2010 folk opera musical ''[[Hadestown]]'' retells the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice with a soundtrack inspired by American blues and jazz, portraying [[Hades]] as the brutal work-boss of an underground mining city. Mitchell, together with director [[Rachel Chavkin]], later adapted her album into a multiple Tony award winning [[Hadestown (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n===Reception===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2020}}\n\nBecause of the pervasiveness of the Orpheus myth, many interpretations are in conversation with previous interpretations as well: [[Pina Bausch]]'s dance-opera ''Orpheus und Euridike'' displays original choreography set to Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice''. [[Baz Luhrmann]], in DVD commentaries for his 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', characterizes the film as, in part, a tale of an Orphic hero (in this case a songwriter) who embarks upon a visit to the underworld (in this case the [[demi-monde]] around Paris' [[Montmartre]]) in search of his fortune and ultimately to attempt the rescue of his doomed love.The film adapts a widely known piece from [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s comedic operetta ''Orph\u00e9e aux enfers'' (''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''), identified with the once-popular [[can-can]] music hall dance. Offenbach's operatic work had itself parodied the classical tale of Orpheus' attempted rescue of Eurydice from Pluto (Hades). [[Gavin Bryars]]' music for [[\u00c9douard Lock]]'s full length ballet ''Dido and Orfeo'' (2011) reworks music from the operas ''Dido and Aeneas'' (Purcell) and ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' (Gluck) for a small ensemble of saxophone, viola, cello and piano. In 2019, [[Sara Bareilles]] released her sixth studio album ''[[Amidst the Chaos]]'' which features a song titled \"Orpheus\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aornum]]\n* ''[[Argonautica Orphica]]''\n* [[Katabasis]]\n* [[Leibethra]]\n* [[List of Orphean operas]]\n* [[Pierian Spring]]\n* [[Pimpleia]]\n* [[Sir Orfeo]]\n* [[3361 Orpheus]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' I, iii, 2; ix, 16 & 25;\n* [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' I, 23\u201334; IV, 891\u2013909.\n* Bernab\u00e9, Albertus (ed.), ''Orphicorum et Orphicis similium testimonia et fragmenta.

Its name comes from the Irish ''Machaire Cluana'' which means 'plain of meadow'. This is a strange name for such a hilly parish; it is derived from its most important place in ancient times; a flat area of land in the townland of Camaghy, on which the sports ground and ancient church of St. Molua were located. The parish covers 12,952 statute acres in area, making it the largest parish in South Monaghan. The parish borders three neighbouring counties; [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]]. (Magheracloone is the only parish in Monaghan to border Meath).\n\nThe parish contains numerous natural resources such as [[gypsum]], which is mined locally. During the 1840s, the population numbered approximately 9,000; today, it is approximately 2,000, but is again growing as a result of economic growth and construction, among other factors. The parish is located on the commuter belt, within 50 statute miles of Dublin (approximately 80 minutes' driving time), and 20 minutes from the M1 motorway.\n\n== History ==\nThe absentee 'Shirley Family' landlords once owned the majority of land in the parish. Their holdings have since been reduced to include a 4000-acre walled estate, just outside Carrickmacross, where the family seat, Lough Fea house, is located. They also technically own the west side of Carrickmacross Main Street, and continue to collect ground rents from most businesses located there, much to the ire of locals (the case for ground rent has been upheld in the Irish courts).\n\n== The Battle of Magheracloone ==\n[[File:Ss. Peter & Paul.JPG|thumb|Ss. Peter & Paul Roman Catholic church (1825), Magheracloone, Co. Monaghan, Ireland]]\nThe 'Battle of Magheracloone' occurred in 1843 at Ss. Peter & Paul's Roman Catholic church.\nThe text now follows of a plaque recently erected there in memoriam:\n\n\" In 1843 the tenants on the Shirley estate, of which Magheracloone was a part, refused to pay their rent until their complaints had been addressed by the landlord. Attempts by the bailiffs to seize cattle or goods from the tenants who would not pay were stopped by the activities of \u2018The Molly Maguires\u2019. The centre of British rule in Ireland, Dublin Castle, agreed to provide troops to protect the agents who were serving notices of eviction to tenants. On June 5, 1843, a bailiff from the Shirley Estate along with a company of troops marched toward the church of Saints Peter and Paul (this very church) in Magheracloone. The intention was to post a notice of eviction to several tenants in the area, on the door of the church. They were\nmet by a large, howling and hooting crowd who blocked their path. The troops fixed\ntheir bayonets and moved forward, only to be met with a shower of stones.\nSeveral of the troops were hit with stones and at the same instant the entire company\ndischarged one round each from their guns into the crowd. The crowd backed off.\nThe Company Commander, fearful of a greater slaughter, called his troops back to\ntheir carriages and they beat a speedy retreat, followed all the way by angry\nremnants of the crowd. However, back on the road in front of the\nchurch a young servant boy lay dead. Peter Agnew from Lisnaguiveragh,\nCarrickmacross was at service with Owen Smith of Corrybracken\nTwo days later the coroner\u2019s jury (composed of six Protestants and thirteen Roman\nCatholics) held that as it was not known whose shot had killed the boy, no\nresponsibility could be assessed. But the jury pointedly commented that \u2018it has not been\nsufficiently proved to us that at the time of the firing the party of Constabulary were in\nimminent risk of their lives\u2019. (Outrage Papers). While this incident may be described as a\nmere skirmish with one fatality, reporting of the event in the local, national and\ninternational newspapers prompted questions to be raised in the House of Commons \".\n\n== Faith ==\n[[File:Ss.

St. Molua's is located on the site of the original Roman Catholic church, from which Catholics were barred during the penal laws. At that time, Catholics attended school and worshipped outside at 'hedge schools' and 'mass rocks', as they were barred from having suitable buildings for these purposes, speaking Irish was banned, and the people were required (in public office and many professions) to take an oath citing the supremacy of the monarch over the Roman Pontiff - an oath which Catholics obviously could not take. A mass rock exists on private property along the River Glyde in Tonaneave; a long stone crosses the river to form a bridge; the priest would stand on one side, and the congregation on the other; the river served both to separate the people from the sacrament (the function performed by a redoros in a church) and to drown out their prayers, for fear of being heard by British soldiers. It is said that, during the Penal Laws, local Protestants kept watch on the hills above to ensure the safety of their Catholic neighbours hearing mass by the river in the valley below. Another example of such kindness comes from the story of a woman who was to be evicted from her home in the parish by bailiffs because she could not pay her rent; one of the soldiers took pity on her and passed around an iron cooking pot, collecting money from the other soldiers until enough was donated such that the woman's rent could be paid. Mass was most recently celebrated at this mass rock in the Jubilee Year 2000; it was concelebrated by PP Fr. Tom Finnegan, Canon Mohan and Fr. Michael J. Gilsenan and attended by a large congregation.\nThe ceremony served to memorialise the victims of the penal laws, which climaxed in the tragedy of The Great Famine. Catholic Emancipation saw an explosion in the number of Roman Catholic churches and schools built in Ireland.\n[[File:Mass Rock.JPG|thumb|Mass Rock]]\n[[File:Mass Rock & Long Stone.JPG|thumb|Mass Rock & Long Stone]]\n[[File:River Glyde.JPG|thumb|River Glyde]]\n\nSt. Molua's cemetery contains the remains of both Protestants and Catholics and was cleared from its overgrown condition in the 1980s, to much acclaim. (All cemeteries in the parish are immaculately maintained). In the 1970s, however, both the interior and exterior of Ss. Peter & Paul church (a 'barn church' constructed in 1825) were extensively damaged as a result of perhaps well-meaning but nonetheless gravely ill-conceived 'renovations' by then parish priest, Canon Drum, much to the consternation of locals who wished to continue worshiping at the altar built by their ancestors as an expression of their civic pride in the climate of Catholic Emancipation. \n[[File:Sanctuary and high altar.JPG|thumb|Sanctuary and high altar]]\nThe Ss. Peter & Paul church still includes an intricate wooden ceiling. Constructed on an East-West axis, facing the rising sun (a symbol of Christ - The Celtic cross features the rising sun, a Celtic symbol, fused with a cross, as a symbol of the new Christian faith conquering the ancient pagan one), the building is renowned for its light and spaciousness. Its Turnerelli altar and side altars, redoros, mosaics, galleries and pipe organ, were all lost. Two stone crosses were also removed from the pinnacles of the exterior gables and replaced with iron crosses. \n[[File:Stained glass, Ss. Peter & Paul.JPG|thumb|Stained glass, Ss.

Born and raised in the town-land of Greaghlone, he went on to achieve international fame, becoming the first person ever photographed while playing a harp.  \nHe retired to the townland of Beagh at the end of his life and is buried in [[Carrickmacross]].<ref>M\u00edche\u00e1l Mac Diarmada, (2005) Mr. Patrick Byrne \u2013 The Blind Irish Harper, ''The Northern Standard'' 14 April, p.40.</ref> A monument to the blind harper was recently erected by Magheracloone Heritage Group at the Ball Alley junction along the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt road (which passes through Magheracloone). A GAA sports ground and community centre are located next to this monument.

They have achieved runner-up status three times; in 2002, 2005 and 2006. Their colours are those of the parish, being simply black and white. Senior Gaelic footballer Thomas Freeman was presented with a GAA All Star award in 2007 and his brother, Damien Freeman is a former captain of county Monaghan's Gaelic football team. The parish also boasts under-14 boys' & girls' Olympic Handball teams. The boys' team achieved all-Ireland runner-up and the girls' team came 1st in Ireland in 2006.\n\n==Sinkholes==\nIn September 2018 a sinkhole made the local GAA pitch subside and Dromgossatt National School was evacuated.<ref name=rte-monaghan-mine-collapse>{{Cite news|title=Investigation into Co Monaghan mine collapse|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/0924/995781-monaghan-mine-collapse/|last=Magnier|first=Eileen|date=26 September 2018|access-date=18 April 2020|publisher=[[RT\u00c9 News]]}}</ref> It happened in land over an old gypsum mine.<ref name=rte-monaghan-mine-collapse/>\n\nIn April 2020 a [[crown hole]] appeared in land over the mine.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Crown hole appears in Magheracloone, Co Monaghan|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/regional/2020/0417/1132198-crownhole-monaghan/|last=Hussey|first=Sinead|date=17 April 2020|access-date=18 April 2020|publisher=[[RT\u00c9 News]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Civil parishes of County Monaghan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Magheracloone \n|other_name             = {{pad top italic|Machaire Cluana}}\n|settlement_type        = Town\n|image_skyline          = \n|image_caption          = \n|pushpin_map            = Ireland\n|pushpin_label_position = right\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Ireland\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = Ireland\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Ulster]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[Counties of Ireland|County]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[County Monaghan]]\n|established_title      = \n|established_date       = \n|unit_pref              = Metric\n|area_footnotes         = \n|area_total_km2         = 52.415\n|population_as_of       = est.\n|population_footnotes   = \n|population_total       = \n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|timezone1              = [[West European Time|WET]] \n|utc_offset1            = +0\n|timezone1_DST          = [[Irish Standard Time|IST]] ([[Western European Summer Time|WEST]]) \n|utc_offset1_DST        = -1\n|coordinates            = {{coord|53.9046|-6.7349|dim:100000_region:IE|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    = \n|elevation_m            = \n|blank_name             = [[Irish grid reference system|Irish Grid Reference]]\n|blank_info             = {{iem4ibx|N825994}}\n|website                = \n|footnotes              = \n}}\n'''Magheracloone''' is a parish in south [[County Monaghan]]. Its name comes from the Irish ''Machaire Cluana'' which means 'plain of meadow'. This is a strange name for such a hilly parish; it is derived from its most important place in ancient times; a flat area of land in the townland of Camaghy, on which the sports ground and ancient church of St. Molua were located. The parish covers 12,952 statute acres in area, making it the largest parish in South Monaghan. The parish borders three neighbouring counties; [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]]. (Magheracloone is the only parish in Monaghan to border Meath).\n\nThe parish contains numerous natural resources such as [[gypsum]], which is mined locally. During the 1840s, the population numbered approximately 9,000; today, it is approximately 2,000, but is again growing as a result of economic growth and construction, among other factors. The parish is located on the commuter belt, within 50 statute miles of Dublin (approximately 80 minutes' driving time), and 20 minutes from the M1 motorway.\n\n== History ==\nThe absentee 'Shirley Family' landlords once owned the majority of land in the parish. Their holdings have since been reduced to include a 4000-acre walled estate, just outside Carrickmacross, where the family seat, Lough Fea house, is located. They also technically own the west side of Carrickmacross Main Street, and continue to collect ground rents from most businesses located there, much to the ire of locals (the case for ground rent has been upheld in the Irish courts).\n\n== The Battle of Magheracloone ==\n[[File:Ss. Peter & Paul.JPG|thumb|Ss. Peter & Paul Roman Catholic church (1825), Magheracloone, Co. Monaghan, Ireland]]\nThe 'Battle of Magheracloone' occurred in 1843 at Ss. Peter & Paul's Roman Catholic church.\nThe text now follows of a plaque recently erected there in memoriam:\n\n\" In 1843 the tenants on the Shirley estate, of which Magheracloone was a part, refused to pay their rent until their complaints had been addressed by the landlord. Attempts by the bailiffs to seize cattle or goods from the tenants who would not pay were stopped by the activities of \u2018The Molly Maguires\u2019. The centre of British rule in Ireland, Dublin Castle, agreed to provide troops to protect the agents who were serving notices of eviction to tenants. On June 5, 1843, a bailiff from the Shirley Estate along with a company of troops marched toward the church of Saints Peter and Paul (this very church) in Magheracloone. The intention was to post a notice of eviction to several tenants in the area, on the door of the church. They were\nmet by a large, howling and hooting crowd who blocked their path. The troops fixed\ntheir bayonets and moved forward, only to be met with a shower of stones.\nSeveral of the troops were hit with stones and at the same instant the entire company\ndischarged one round each from their guns into the crowd. The crowd backed off.\nThe Company Commander, fearful of a greater slaughter, called his troops back to\ntheir carriages and they beat a speedy retreat, followed all the way by angry\nremnants of the crowd. However, back on the road in front of the\nchurch a young servant boy lay dead. Peter Agnew from Lisnaguiveragh,\nCarrickmacross was at service with Owen Smith of Corrybracken\nTwo days later the coroner\u2019s jury (composed of six Protestants and thirteen Roman\nCatholics) held that as it was not known whose shot had killed the boy, no\nresponsibility could be assessed. But the jury pointedly commented that \u2018it has not been\nsufficiently proved to us that at the time of the firing the party of Constabulary were in\nimminent risk of their lives\u2019. (Outrage Papers). While this incident may be described as a\nmere skirmish with one fatality, reporting of the event in the local, national and\ninternational newspapers prompted questions to be raised in the House of Commons \".\n\n== Faith ==\n[[File:Ss.
