The [[2016 Summer Olympics|most recent Olympics]] were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event, [[gold medal]]s are awarded for first place, [[silver medal]]s are awarded for second place, and [[bronze medal]]s are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were created out of the success of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].\n\nThe Summer Olympics has been hosted on five continents by a total of nineteen countries. The Games have been held four times in the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] ([[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]), three times in the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]] ([[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]], and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]), twice each in [[Greece at the Olympics|Greece]] ([[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]), [[France at the Olympics|France]] ([[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]), [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]] ([[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]] and [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]), and [[Australia at the Olympics|Australia]] ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]), and once each in [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] ([[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]), [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]] ([[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]), [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]] ([[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]), [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] ([[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]), [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]] ([[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]]), [[Japan at the Olympics|Japan]] ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]] ([[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]), [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]] ([[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]), [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] ([[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]]), [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]] ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]] ([[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]]), [[China at the Olympics|China]] ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]), and [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]] ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]).\n\nThe IOC has selected [[Tokyo]], Japan, for a second time, to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] (due to take place in 2021). The [[2024 Summer Olympics]] will be held in [[Paris]], France, for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to host its third Summer Games in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].\n\nTo date, only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games \u2013 [[Australia]], [[France]], Great Britain, Greece, and [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]]. The United States leads the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Summer Olympics|all-time medal table]] for the Summer Olympics.\n\n==Hosting==\n[[File:Summer olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Map of Summer Olympic Games locations \u2013 countries that have hosted one Summer Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue]]\n\nThe [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] has hosted the Summer Olympic Games four times: the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]] was held in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]; the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] Games were both held in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Games]] were held in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Games]] in Los Angeles will mark the fifth occasion on which the Summer Games have been hosted by the U.S.\n\nIn [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]], the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]] hosted its third Summer Olympic Games in the capital city, [[London]], which became the first city ever to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times. The cities of Los Angeles, [[Paris]], and [[Athens]] have each hosted two Summer Olympic Games. [[2024 Summer Olympics|In 2024]], [[France at the Olympics|France]] will host its third Summer Olympic Games in its capital, making Paris the second city ever to have hosted three Summer Olympics. In 2028, Los Angeles will become the third city ever to have hosted the Games three times.\n\n[[Australia at the Olympics|Australia]], France, [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]] and [[Greece at the Olympics|Greece]] have all hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. The IOC has selected [[Tokyo]], Japan, to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], when it will become the first city outside the Western world to have hosted the Summer Olympics more than once, having already hosted the Games [[1964 Summer Olympics|in 1964]]. The other countries that have hosted the Summer Olympics are [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]], [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]], [[China at the Olympics|China]], [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]], [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]], [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]], [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]], [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]], [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]], [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], and [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]]; each of these countries has hosted the Summer Games on just one occasion.\n\n[[Asia]] has hosted the Summer Olympics three times, in Tokyo, Japan ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Seoul]], South Korea ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), and [[Beijing]], China ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]); Asia will host the Games for the fourth time. Tokyo was for the second time slated to be the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics; however, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Summer Olympics have been postponed to twelve months from the original scheduled date. Historically, the Summer Olympics has been held predominantly in [[English-speaking countries]] and [[Europe|European nations]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Kay|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|date=2000|page=271}}</ref> Tokyo will be the first city outside these regions to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice; it will also be the largest city ever to have hosted the Games, [[Tokyo#1943\u2013present|having grown considerably since 1964]].\n\nThe [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, were the inaugural Summer Olympics to be held in [[South America]] and the first that was held completely during the local \"[[winter]]\" season. The only two countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to have hosted the Summer Olympics have been Australia ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]) and Brazil ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]). [[Africa]] has yet to host a Summer Olympics.\n\n[[Stockholm]], Sweden, has hosted events at two Summer Olympics, having been sole host of the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Games]], and hosting the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] (which they are credited as jointly hosting with [[Melbourne]], Australia).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1956|title=Melbourne / Stockholm 1956|publisher=[[IOC]] |accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, has also hosted events at two Summer Olympic Games, having been sole host of the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]] and previously hosting two of the [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|sailing races]] at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], [[Hong Kong]] provided the venues for the [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]], which took place in [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]] and [[Kwu Tung]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The opening ceremony of the first modern Olympic Games in the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]\nThe modern Olympic Games were founded in 1894 when [[Pierre de Coubertin]] sought to promote international understanding through sporting competition. He based his Olympics on the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games]], which had been contested in [[Much Wenlock]] since 1850.<ref name=Wenlock>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Jeffrey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/features/2004/08/william_penny_brookes.shtml |title=Father of the modern Olympics |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The first edition of de Coubertin's games, held in [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens in 1896]], attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, [[Stamata Revithi]], ran the marathon course on her own, saying \"If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless\".<ref name=Revithi>{{cite journal | author=Tarasouleas, Athanasios |date=Summer 1993 | title = The Female Spiridon Loues  | journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 11\u201312 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n3/JOHv1n3e.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1896 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the [[Modern era]]. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although [[Greece]] had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Swifter, Higher, Stronger|last = Macy|first = Sue|publisher = National Geographic|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7922-6667-6|location = Washington D.C, United States|pages = [https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16 16]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16}}</ref> [[Ancient Greece]] was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[pedagogue]] and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] was also established during this congress.\n\nDespite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. [[Panathinaiko Stadium]], the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153 {{fcn|date=November 2019}}</ref> The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spiridon Louis]], a water carrier. He won in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four gold medals.\n\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nFour years later the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|croquet]], [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics|golf]], [[Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics|sailing]], and [[Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics|tennis]]. The Games were integrated with the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World's Fair]] and lasted over 5 months. It is still disputed which events exactly were ''Olympic'', since few or maybe even none of the events were advertised as such at the time.\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Field (Missouri)|Francis Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] during the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]\n[[File:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Dorando Pietri finishes the modern marathon at the current distance]]\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to [[St. Louis]] may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]].<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[1906 Intercalated Games|A series of smaller games]] were held in Athens in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 900 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.\n\nThe [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Games]] saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] over its now-standard distance of 42.195&nbsp; km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40&nbsp; km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been {{convert|40|km|1|abbr=on}} for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw [[Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed [[United States at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Americans]], its best result to this day.\n\nAt the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner [[Dorando Pietri]] was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials, but later he was disqualified, and the gold medal was awarded to [[Johnny Hayes|John Hayes]], who had trailed him by around 30 seconds.\n\nThe Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm in 1912]], including the great all-rounder [[Jim Thorpe]], who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this 'breach' of [[Amateur sports#Olympics|amateurism]] after complaints from [[Avery Brundage]]. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.\n\nThe scheduled [[1916 Summer Olympics]] were cancelled following the onset of [[World War I]].\n\n===Interwar era===\nThe [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp games]] in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]]. The \"[[Flying Finn]]\" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paavo Nurmi \u2013 THE FLYING FINN \u2013 Life Story |url=https://paavonurmi.fi/en/life-story/ |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam games]] was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track & field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the games, from [[the Coca-Cola Company]]. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s depiction of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles games]] were affected by the [[Great Depression]], which contributed to the low number of competitors.\n\nThe [[1936 Berlin Games]] were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party commissioned film-maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to film the games. The result, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s theories of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by \"non-Aryan\" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper [[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals. The [[1936 Berlin Games]] also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 August 2008 | date=5 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nDue to World War II, the [[1940 Summer Olympics|Games of 1940]] (due to be held in [[Tokyo]] and temporarily relocated to [[Helsinki]] upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The [[1944 Summer Olympics|Games of 1944]] were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].\n\n===After World War II===\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Games]] were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.\n\nAt the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]] in [[Helsinki]] the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|USSR team]] competed for the first time and immediately became one of the dominant teams (finishing second both in the number of gold and overall medals won). Soviet immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\". The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|USSR]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Z\u00e1topek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.\n\nThe [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Games]] were largely successful, barring a [[water polo]] match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] caused to end as [[Blood in the Water match|a pitched battle between the teams]]. Due to a [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.\n\nAt the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]] a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] restaurant in his home town of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Wallechinsky | first=David |author2=Jamie Loucky  | year=2008 | title=The Complete Book of the Olympics, 2008 Edition | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1-84513-330-6 | pages=453\u2013454 }}</ref> He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Other performers of note in 1960 included [[Wilma Rudolph]], a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay events.\n\nThe [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] held in Tokyo are notable for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. These games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka [[Anton Geesink]] created quite a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] in front of his home crowd.\n\nPerformances at the 1968 [[Mexico City]] [[1968 Summer Olympics|games]] were affected by the altitude of the host city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1968 |title=Games of the XIX Olympiad |work=olympic.org |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal [[Fosbury flop]], a technique which won American high jumper [[Dick Fosbury]] the gold medal. In the medal award ceremony for the men's 200 meter race, [[black American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] (gold) and [[John Carlos]] (bronze) took a stand for [[civil rights]] by raising their [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black-gloved fists]] and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. They were banned by the IOC. [[V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1]], in protest to the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people but was made an outcast by the Soviet-dominated government.\n\nPolitics again intervened at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972, with [[Munich massacre|lethal consequences]]. A Palestinian terrorist group named [[Black September (group)|Black September]] invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, it was decided that the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1972 |title=Games of the XX Olympiad |work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star [[Olga Korbut]] - who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]].\n\nThere was no such tragedy in [[Montreal]] in 1976, but bad planning and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. [[1976 Summer Olympics|The Montreal Games]] were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], costing over $5&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|CA|5|1976|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|CA}}). For a time, it seemed that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, may have contributed to the delays, poor construction and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia \"was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen;(April 2009).Ice: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada. p.551. {{ISBN|0-470-83500-1}}:</ref> There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|a recent tour]] of [[apartheid]]-run South Africa by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. The Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, this giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in [[Romania]]. She also won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his double gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.<!--\n\nDeleted image removed: [[File:1980 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|Closing Ceremony of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], in Moscow, [[Soviet Union]], with bear cub [[Misha]], the mascot of that year's games, flying into the sky.]] -->\n\n===End of the 20th century===\nFollowing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 games]] held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games \u2013 the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.\n\nIn 1984 the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies reciprocated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. [[Romania]], notably, was one of the nations in the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=NO BOYCOTT BLUES|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}</ref> The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.\n\nAccording to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".<ref name=DG2011>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}</ref> On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.\n\nThe [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's \"[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]\". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been incorporated into the Soviet Union since World War II. At these games, gymnast [[Vitaly Scherbo]] set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by [[Eric Heiden]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].\n\nBy then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process.\n\nAn the Atlanta [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the highlight was [[200 meters]] runner [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured [[Donovan Bailey]]'s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when [[Muhammad Ali]], clearly affected by [[Parkinson's disease]], lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb exploded]] during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], was arrested.\n\n[[File:Sydney olympic stadium track and field.jpg|left|thumb|The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney, Australia, known as the \"Games of the New Millennium\".]]\n\nThe [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held in Sydney, Australia, and showcased individual performances by local favorite [[Ian Thorpe]] in the pool, Briton [[Steve Redgrave]] who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and [[Cathy Freeman]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] whose triumph in the [[400 meters]] united a packed stadium. [[Eric Moussambani|Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani]], a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot [[Paula Barila Bolopa]] also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed as different countries. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.\n\n===Start of the 21st century===\nIn [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the Olympic Games returned to their birthplace in [[Athens]], Greece. At least $7.2&nbsp;billion was spent on the 2004 Games, including $1.5&nbsp;billion on security. [[Michael Phelps]] won his first Olympic medals, tallying six gold and two bronze medals. [[Pyrros Dimas]], winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with four Olympic medals, three gold and one bronze. Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions at the first weekend of the Olympics (14\u201315&nbsp;August 2004), attendance picked up as the Games progressed.

Several new events were held, including the new discipline of [[BMX]] for both men and women. Women competed in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] for the first time. The fencing program was expanded to include all six events for both men and women; previously, women had not been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e and men's team foil were dropped for these Games. Marathon swimming events were added, over the distance of {{convert|10|km|1|abbr=on}}.

Another notable star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]], who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200&nbsp;metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.\n\nLondon held the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games three times. In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"Happy and glorious\". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Games]] in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 program. The London Games were successful on a commercial level because they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1&nbsp;million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event that there was controversy over seats being set aside for sponsors and National Delegations which went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil hosted the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first South American city to host the Olympics, the second Olympic host city in Latin America, after [[Mexico City]] in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], as well as the third city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to host the Olympics after [[Melbourne]], Australia, in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Sydney]], Australia, in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by [[Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics|controversies]], including the political instability of Brazil's federal government; the country's economic crisis; health and safety concerns surrounding the [[Zika virus]] and significant pollution in the [[Guanabara Bay]]; and a [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping scandal]] involving [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], which affected the participation of its athletes in the Games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8282518.stm |title=BBC SPORT, Olympics, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2009|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe [[2020 Summer Olympics|next Summer Games]] were originally scheduled to take place from 24&nbsp;July to 9&nbsp;August 2020 in [[Tokyo]], Japan.

There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition.

The [[2016 Summer Olympics|most recent Olympics]] were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event, [[gold medal]]s are awarded for first place, [[silver medal]]s are awarded for second place, and [[bronze medal]]s are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were created out of the success of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].\n\nThe Summer Olympics has been hosted on five continents by a total of nineteen countries.

The [[2024 Summer Olympics]] will be held in [[Paris]], France, for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to host its third Summer Games in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].\n\nTo date, only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games \u2013 [[Australia]], [[France]], Great Britain, Greece, and [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]].

Tokyo was for the second time slated to be the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics; however, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Summer Olympics have been postponed to twelve months from the original scheduled date.

Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, [[Stamata Revithi]], ran the marathon course on her own, saying \"If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless\".<ref name=Revithi>{{cite journal | author=Tarasouleas, Athanasios |date=Summer 1993 | title = The Female Spiridon Loues  | journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 11\u201312 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n3/JOHv1n3e.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1896 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the [[Modern era]]. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although [[Greece]] had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Swifter, Higher, Stronger|last = Macy|first = Sue|publisher = National Geographic|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7922-6667-6|location = Washington D.C, United States|pages = [https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16 16]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16}}</ref> [[Ancient Greece]] was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[pedagogue]] and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] was also established during this congress.\n\nDespite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. [[Panathinaiko Stadium]], the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153 {{fcn|date=November 2019}}</ref> The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spiridon Louis]], a water carrier. He won in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four gold medals.\n\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nFour years later the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|croquet]], [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics|golf]], [[Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics|sailing]], and [[Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics|tennis]]. The Games were integrated with the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World's Fair]] and lasted over 5 months. It is still disputed which events exactly were ''Olympic'', since few or maybe even none of the events were advertised as such at the time.\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Field (Missouri)|Francis Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] during the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]\n[[File:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Dorando Pietri finishes the modern marathon at the current distance]]\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to [[St. Louis]] may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]].<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[1906 Intercalated Games|A series of smaller games]] were held in Athens in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 900 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.\n\nThe [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Games]] saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] over its now-standard distance of 42.195&nbsp; km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40&nbsp; km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been {{convert|40|km|1|abbr=on}} for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw [[Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed [[United States at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Americans]], its best result to this day.\n\nAt the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner [[Dorando Pietri]] was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials, but later he was disqualified, and the gold medal was awarded to [[Johnny Hayes|John Hayes]], who had trailed him by around 30 seconds.\n\nThe Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm in 1912]], including the great all-rounder [[Jim Thorpe]], who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this 'breach' of [[Amateur sports#Olympics|amateurism]] after complaints from [[Avery Brundage]]. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.\n\nThe scheduled [[1916 Summer Olympics]] were cancelled following the onset of [[World War I]].\n\n===Interwar era===\nThe [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp games]] in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]]. The \"[[Flying Finn]]\" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paavo Nurmi \u2013 THE FLYING FINN \u2013 Life Story |url=https://paavonurmi.fi/en/life-story/ |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam games]] was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track & field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the games, from [[the Coca-Cola Company]]. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s depiction of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles games]] were affected by the [[Great Depression]], which contributed to the low number of competitors.\n\nThe [[1936 Berlin Games]] were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party commissioned film-maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to film the games. The result, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s theories of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by \"non-Aryan\" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper [[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals. The [[1936 Berlin Games]] also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 August 2008 | date=5 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nDue to World War II, the [[1940 Summer Olympics|Games of 1940]] (due to be held in [[Tokyo]] and temporarily relocated to [[Helsinki]] upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The [[1944 Summer Olympics|Games of 1944]] were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].\n\n===After World War II===\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Games]] were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.\n\nAt the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]] in [[Helsinki]] the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|USSR team]] competed for the first time and immediately became one of the dominant teams (finishing second both in the number of gold and overall medals won). Soviet immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\". The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|USSR]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Z\u00e1topek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.\n\nThe [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Games]] were largely successful, barring a [[water polo]] match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] caused to end as [[Blood in the Water match|a pitched battle between the teams]]. Due to a [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.\n\nAt the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]] a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] restaurant in his home town of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Wallechinsky | first=David |author2=Jamie Loucky  | year=2008 | title=The Complete Book of the Olympics, 2008 Edition | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1-84513-330-6 | pages=453\u2013454 }}</ref> He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Other performers of note in 1960 included [[Wilma Rudolph]], a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay events.\n\nThe [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] held in Tokyo are notable for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. These games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka [[Anton Geesink]] created quite a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] in front of his home crowd.\n\nPerformances at the 1968 [[Mexico City]] [[1968 Summer Olympics|games]] were affected by the altitude of the host city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1968 |title=Games of the XIX Olympiad |work=olympic.org |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal [[Fosbury flop]], a technique which won American high jumper [[Dick Fosbury]] the gold medal. In the medal award ceremony for the men's 200 meter race, [[black American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] (gold) and [[John Carlos]] (bronze) took a stand for [[civil rights]] by raising their [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black-gloved fists]] and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. They were banned by the IOC. [[V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1]], in protest to the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people but was made an outcast by the Soviet-dominated government.\n\nPolitics again intervened at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972, with [[Munich massacre|lethal consequences]]. A Palestinian terrorist group named [[Black September (group)|Black September]] invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, it was decided that the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1972 |title=Games of the XX Olympiad |work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star [[Olga Korbut]] - who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]].\n\nThere was no such tragedy in [[Montreal]] in 1976, but bad planning and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. [[1976 Summer Olympics|The Montreal Games]] were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], costing over $5&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|CA|5|1976|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|CA}}). For a time, it seemed that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, may have contributed to the delays, poor construction and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia \"was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen;(April 2009).Ice: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada. p.551. {{ISBN|0-470-83500-1}}:</ref> There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|a recent tour]] of [[apartheid]]-run South Africa by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. The Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, this giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in [[Romania]]. She also won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his double gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.<!--\n\nDeleted image removed: [[File:1980 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|Closing Ceremony of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], in Moscow, [[Soviet Union]], with bear cub [[Misha]], the mascot of that year's games, flying into the sky.]] -->\n\n===End of the 20th century===\nFollowing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 games]] held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games \u2013 the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.\n\nIn 1984 the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies reciprocated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. [[Romania]], notably, was one of the nations in the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=NO BOYCOTT BLUES|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}</ref> The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.\n\nAccording to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".<ref name=DG2011>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}</ref> On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.\n\nThe [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's \"[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]\". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been incorporated into the Soviet Union since World War II. At these games, gymnast [[Vitaly Scherbo]] set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by [[Eric Heiden]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].\n\nBy then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process.\n\nAn the Atlanta [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the highlight was [[200 meters]] runner [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured [[Donovan Bailey]]'s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when [[Muhammad Ali]], clearly affected by [[Parkinson's disease]], lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb exploded]] during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], was arrested.\n\n[[File:Sydney olympic stadium track and field.jpg|left|thumb|The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney, Australia, known as the \"Games of the New Millennium\".]]\n\nThe [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held in Sydney, Australia, and showcased individual performances by local favorite [[Ian Thorpe]] in the pool, Briton [[Steve Redgrave]] who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and [[Cathy Freeman]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] whose triumph in the [[400 meters]] united a packed stadium. [[Eric Moussambani|Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani]], a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot [[Paula Barila Bolopa]] also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed as different countries. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.\n\n===Start of the 21st century===\nIn [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the Olympic Games returned to their birthplace in [[Athens]], Greece. At least $7.2&nbsp;billion was spent on the 2004 Games, including $1.5&nbsp;billion on security. [[Michael Phelps]] won his first Olympic medals, tallying six gold and two bronze medals. [[Pyrros Dimas]], winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with four Olympic medals, three gold and one bronze.

Several new events were held, including the new discipline of [[BMX]] for both men and women. Women competed in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] for the first time. The fencing program was expanded to include all six events for both men and women; previously, women had not been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e and men's team foil were dropped for these Games.

Another notable star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]], who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200&nbsp;metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.\n\nLondon held the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games three times. In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"Happy and glorious\". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Games]] in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 program. The London Games were successful on a commercial level because they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1&nbsp;million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event that there was controversy over seats being set aside for sponsors and National Delegations which went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil hosted the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first South American city to host the Olympics, the second Olympic host city in Latin America, after [[Mexico City]] in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], as well as the third city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to host the Olympics after [[Melbourne]], Australia, in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Sydney]], Australia, in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]].

There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) may enter a limited number of qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.<ref name=\"olympians\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|title=National Olympic Committees (NOCs)|work=Olympic.org|publisher=[[IOC]]|access-date=21 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074558/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|archive-date=15 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nNations most often qualify teams for team sports through continental qualifying tournaments, in which each continental association is given a certain number of spots in the Olympic tournament. Each nation may be represented by no more than one team per competition; a team consists of just two people in some sports.\n\n===Popularity of Olympic sports===\nSummer Olympic sports are divided into five categories (A \u2013 E) based on popularity, gauged by six criteria: television viewing figures (40%), internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category of a sport determines the share of Olympic revenue received by that sport's International Federation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Athletics to share limelight as one of top Olympic sports |url=http://www.qt.com.au/news/atheltics-share-limelight-one-top-olympic-sports/1889097/ |newspaper=The Queensland Times |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Winners Include Gymnastics, Swimming - and Wrestling - as IOC Announces New Funding Distribution Groupings  | work=The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations | url=http://asoif.com/News/News_Article.aspx?ID=3392  | accessdate=2013-07-18 }}</ref> Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.\n\nThe current categories are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Dialectrix]] has described it as a \"mongrel mutation\" of Afro-centric and Australian culture.<ref name=\"The Vine\"/> According to the lyrics of Def Wish Cast, it is \"down under, comin' up.\"<ref name=\"Sydney Stylee\" /><ref name=\"Mitchell\">Mitchell, Tony. \"World Music and the Popular Music Industry: An Australian View.\" ''Ethnomusicology,'' Vol. 37, No. 3 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 309\u2013338.</ref>\n\nAustralian hip hop has been localised with the introduction of aspects such as the Australian accent, Australian slang, political views, and references to localities and matters of Australian cultural identity. The lyrics of early Western Sydney artists like 046, Def Wish Cast and the White Boys represent the process of localising Australian hip hop. Additionally, the non-Anglo immigrants of these areas were attracted to hip hop because it tackles the theme of racial opposition, as in African American and Chicano hip hop.<ref name=\"Tony\" /> Australian hip hop has been described as rich with Australian character, but also as inspirational for immigrants, providing \"a voice and a purpose for those making their home anew in Australia.\"<ref name=\"Phat of the land\"/> For example, [[Diafrix]] use migrant experiences in some of their songs, although this is not their main focus.<ref name=\"redbull.com.au\">http://www.redbull.com.au/cs/Satellite/en_AU/Article/Diafrix-on-how-theyre-running-it-in-2013-021243330130007</ref>\n\nNumerous Australian hip-hop artists have expressed concern that sections of Australia's hip hop fanbase seem to espouse a \"[[redneck]]\" mentality that is ignorant of the culture's international influences.<ref name=\"The Vine\"/><ref name=\"Quartermaine\"/> In a 2009 interview, Cross Bred Mongrels member Flak explained: \"I don't go for that.

For example, Def Wish described his style as influenced by [[reggae]] from [[London]], rather than [[North American]] rap, while also acknowledging [[Afro-Caribbean]] roots of that scene.<ref name=\"Maxwell\">{{cite book|author=Ian Maxwell|title=Phat Beats, Dope Rhymes: Hip Hop Down Under Comin' Upper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYIqnwEACAAJ|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-6638-6|quote=Def Wish took pains to tell me that his style is influenced by London reggae rap rather than North American rap, conceding the Afro-Caribbean \"roots\" of that scene, but carefully distancing himself from charges of imitation or of subjection to a putative American cultural imperialism.}}</ref>\n\n===Gutter rap===\n\nCompletely distinguishing itself from most Australian Hip Hop at the time, that rap about [[Middle-class]] lifestyle and issues (such as breakups, skating, going to the RSL), a new scene originating from Australia's infamous [[Public housing in Australia|Housing Commission]] estates began emerging in the late 2000s called Gutter rap (sometimes known as Lad rap). Gutter rap artists such as [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]]'s [[Kerser]], [[Hurstville]]'s Skeamo and Nter, and [[Blacktown]]'s Fortay rap primarily about Australian [[Lower social class|Lower-class]] lifestyle and issues (such as crime, drug addictions, financial struggles), similar to traditional American [[Gangsta rap]], which resulted it in being branded an Australian version of the American music genre. Unlike most other Australian hip hop scenes, which have proper mainstream presence and support, gutter rap remains underground on the internet, but that didn't stop artists from the genre gaining mainstream recognition and success, an example being Kersers second album ''No Rest for the Sickest'' reaching No. 15 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA albums chart]],.<ref name=\"arianorest\">{{cite news\n |title        = Chartifacts \u2013 Wednesday 14th November 2012\n |url          = http://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/35761/chartifacts---wednesday-14th-november-2012\n |newspaper    = ARIA Charts\n |date         = 14 November 2012\n |accessdate   = 13 October 2013\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016010247/http://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/35761/chartifacts---wednesday-14th-november-2012\n |archive-date = 16 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous Australian hip hop===\n{{see also|Indigenous music of Australia}}\n[[File:Briggs at Festival Hall, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Briggs (rapper)|Briggs]] has the name of his Indigenous tribe, the [[Yorta Yorta people]], tattooed on his forearms \"so every time I rock the mic people know I\u2019m representing.\"<ref name=\"gt\">{{cite web|title=BRIGGS|url=http://giftedandtalented.net.au/music/briggs/|work=GiftedandTalented.com.au|publisher=G&T|accessdate=19 August 2012|author=Matthew Dunn|date=10 March 2012|quote=\"Being Koori is me; it\u2019s not a hat I take on or off.

The lyrics of early Western Sydney artists like 046, Def Wish Cast and the White Boys represent the process of localising Australian hip hop. Additionally, the non-Anglo immigrants of these areas were attracted to hip hop because it tackles the theme of racial opposition, as in African American and Chicano hip hop.<ref name=\"Tony\" /> Australian hip hop has been described as rich with Australian character, but also as inspirational for immigrants, providing \"a voice and a purpose for those making their home anew in Australia.\"<ref name=\"Phat of the land\"/> For example, [[Diafrix]] use migrant experiences in some of their songs, although this is not their main focus.<ref name=\"redbull.com.au\">http://www.redbull.com.au/cs/Satellite/en_AU/Article/Diafrix-on-how-theyre-running-it-in-2013-021243330130007</ref>\n\nNumerous Australian hip-hop artists have expressed concern that sections of Australia's hip hop fanbase seem to espouse a \"[[redneck]]\" mentality that is ignorant of the culture's international influences.<ref name=\"The Vine\"/><ref name=\"Quartermaine\"/> In a 2009 interview, Cross Bred Mongrels member Flak explained: \"I don't go for that.

Gutter rap artists such as [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]]'s [[Kerser]], [[Hurstville]]'s Skeamo and Nter, and [[Blacktown]]'s Fortay rap primarily about Australian [[Lower social class|Lower-class]] lifestyle and issues (such as crime, drug addictions, financial struggles), similar to traditional American [[Gangsta rap]], which resulted it in being branded an Australian version of the American music genre. Unlike most other Australian hip hop scenes, which have proper mainstream presence and support, gutter rap remains underground on the internet, but that didn't stop artists from the genre gaining mainstream recognition and success, an example being Kersers second album ''No Rest for the Sickest'' reaching No. 15 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA albums chart]],.<ref name=\"arianorest\">{{cite news\n |title        = Chartifacts \u2013 Wednesday 14th November 2012\n |url          = http://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/35761/chartifacts---wednesday-14th-november-2012\n |newspaper    = ARIA Charts\n |date         = 14 November 2012\n |accessdate   = 13 October 2013\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016010247/http://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/35761/chartifacts---wednesday-14th-november-2012\n |archive-date = 16 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous Australian hip hop===\n{{see also|Indigenous music of Australia}}\n[[File:Briggs at Festival Hall, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Briggs (rapper)|Briggs]] has the name of his Indigenous tribe, the [[Yorta Yorta people]], tattooed on his forearms \"so every time I rock the mic people know I\u2019m representing.\"<ref name=\"gt\">{{cite web|title=BRIGGS|url=http://giftedandtalented.net.au/music/briggs/|work=GiftedandTalented.com.au|publisher=G&T|accessdate=19 August 2012|author=Matthew Dunn|date=10 March 2012|quote=\"Being Koori is me; it\u2019s not a hat I take on or off.
