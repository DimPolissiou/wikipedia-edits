The goal is to learn as many songs as possible, and using the script to write the songs facilitates this process.  The script is also used to write letters, notifications, and other documents. The characters are not memorized in any particular order; learners typically begin by learning how to write their name.

script.]]\nThe Hanun\u00f3'o script is conventionally written away from the body (from bottom to top) in columns which go from left to right.<ref name=\"Rubino\"/> Within the columns, characters may have any orientation but the orientation must be consistent for all characters in a text. The characters are typically vertical with the /i/ diacritic on the left and the /u/ on the right, or horizontal with the /i/ on the top and the /u/ on the bottom.<ref name=\"Daniels\"/> Left-handed people often write in mirror image, which reverses both the direction of writing (right to left instead of left to right) and the characters themselves.<ref name=\"Conklin\"/>\n\n==Learning the script==\nYoung Hanun\u00f3'o men and women (called ''layqaw'') learn the script primarily in order to memorize love songs. The goal is to learn as many songs as possible, and using the script to write the songs facilitates this process.  The script is also used to write letters, notifications, and other documents. The characters are not memorized in any particular order; learners typically begin by learning how to write their name. Literacy among the Hanun\u00f3'o people is high despite a lack of formal education in the script.<ref name=\"Conklin\"/>\n\n== Unicode ==\n{{Main article|Hanunoo (Unicode block)}}\nThe [[Unicode]] range for Hanun\u00f3'o  is U+1720&ndash;U+173F:\n\n{{Unicode chart Hanunoo}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baybayin]]\n*[[Buhid script]]\n*[[Tagbanwa alphabet]]\n*[[Kawi script]]\n*[[Filipino orthography]]\n*[[Kulitan (Kapampangan Writing Script)|Kulitan]]\n*See [[Help:Multilingual_support#Hanun.C3.B3.27o|multilingual support]] for fonts supporting Hanun\u00f3'o\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://iloko.tripod.com/hanuscript.gif The Entire Hanun\u00f3o script]\n*[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm Hanun\u00f3o script written clearly]\n\n{{Kawi family}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n{{Philippine scripts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hanuno'o Script}}\n[[Category:Brahmic scripts]]\n[[Category:Philippine scripts]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 -WP:WCWproject (Tag with incorrect syntax - Template value ends with break)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanunuo_script"}
