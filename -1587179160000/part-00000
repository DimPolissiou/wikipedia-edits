During the 2013\u201314 season, Brad Jones did not make any appearance for Liverpool in the [[Premier League]].

Jones regained his place in the Middlesbrough first team in January 2009 and remained first choice as Middlesbrough were relegated from the Premier League. Another pre-season injury saw him miss the start of the season but he regained his place after new signing [[Danny Coyne]] conceded five goals against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

It was the first black church to organize in Birmingham, which was founded just two years before. The first meetings were held in a small building at 12th Street and Fourth Avenue North. A site was soon acquired on 3rd Avenue North between 19th and 20th Street for a dedicated building. In 1880, the church sold that property and built a new church on the present site on 16th Street and 6th Avenue North. The new brick building was completed in 1884 under the supervision of its pastor, [[William R. Pettiford]],<ref>Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p460-465</ref> but in 1908, the city [[Demolition|condemned]] the structure and ordered it to be demolished. Pettiford was pastor from 1883-1904.\n\nThe present building, a \"modified [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] design\" by the prominent black architect [[Wallace Rayfield]], was constructed in 1911 by the local black contractor T.C. Windham.  The cost of construction was $26,000. In addition to the main sanctuary, the building houses a basement auditorium, used for meetings and lectures, and several ancillary rooms used for Sunday school and smaller groups.\n\nAs one of the primary institutions in the black community, the 16th Street Baptist has hosted prominent visitors throughout its history. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Ralph Bunche]] all spoke at the church during the first part of the 20th century.\n\n==Civil rights era and the 1963 bombing==\n[[File:Stained glass window at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass window donated by the people of [[Wales]] after the 1963 bombing of the church.

The reverends [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], who was the chief local organizer, [[James Bevel]], SCLC leader who initiated the Children's Crusade and taught the students [[nonviolence]], and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] were frequent speakers at the church and led the movement.\n\nOn Sunday, September 15, 1963, [[Thomas Edwin Blanton, Jr.|Thomas Blanton]], [[Bobby Frank Cherry]] and [[Robert Edward Chambliss]], members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], planted 19 sticks of [[dynamite]] outside the basement of the church. At 10:22&nbsp;a.m., they exploded, killing four young girls - Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair - and injuring 22 others. They were there preparing for the church's \"Youth Day\".  A funeral for three of the four victims was attended by more than 8,000 mourners, white and black, but no city officials.\n\nThis was one of a string of more than 45 bombings within the decade. The neighborhood of Dynamite Hill was the most-frequently targeted area during this time. The bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church increased Federal involvement in Alabama.  President Johnson passed the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] the following year; and in 1965 the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] was passed, making [[literacy test]]s and poll taxes illegal.\n\nFollowing the bombing, more than $300,000 in unsolicited gifts were received by the church and repairs were begun immediately. The church reopened on June 7, 1964. A stained glass window depicting a [[Race of Jesus#African|black Jesus]], designed by [[John Petts (artist)|John Petts]], was donated by citizens of [[Wales]] and installed in the front window, facing south.\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:Interior view of the basement exhibition at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Basement exhibition at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, with pictures of the events of the Civil Rights Movement and the 1963 bombing of the church.]]\nThe church was added to the [[Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage]] on June 16, 1976.<ref name=\"arlh\"/>  On September 17, 1980, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

It was the first black church to organize in Birmingham, which was founded just two years before. The first meetings were held in a small building at 12th Street and Fourth Avenue North. A site was soon acquired on 3rd Avenue North between 19th and 20th Street for a dedicated building. In 1880, the church sold that property and built a new church on the present site on 16th Street and 6th Avenue North. The new brick building was completed in 1884 under the supervision of its pastor, [[William R. Pettiford]],<ref>Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p460-465</ref> but in 1908, the city [[Demolition|condemned]] the structure and ordered it to be demolished. Pettiford was pastor from 1883-1904.\n\nThe present building, a \"modified [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] design\" by the prominent black architect [[Wallace Rayfield]], was constructed in 1911 by the local black contractor T.C. Windham.  The cost of construction was $26,000. In addition to the main sanctuary, the building houses a basement auditorium, used for meetings and lectures, and several ancillary rooms used for Sunday school and smaller groups.\n\nAs one of the primary institutions in the black community, the 16th Street Baptist has hosted prominent visitors throughout its history. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Ralph Bunche]] all spoke at the church during the first part of the 20th century.\n\n==Civil rights era and the 1963 bombing==\n[[File:Stained glass window at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass window donated by the people of [[Wales]] after the 1963 bombing of the church.
