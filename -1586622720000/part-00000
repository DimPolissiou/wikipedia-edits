Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "Install Norton antivirus on your PC - Visit [https://nortononlinehelp.com/ Norton.com/setup].

It was also the first USAAF airfield to be built in support of Seventh Army operations east of the [[Rhine River]] after two divisions crossed the river near Worms on 26 March 1945.

Since the events of that day are always the same, the two know what will happen where and when. They use this knowledge as an opportunity to do whatever they want, especially at school and/or what usually gets them in trouble.\n\n==Characters==\n*Lucas \"Luc\" Maxwell (voiced by [[Deven Mack|Mac Heywood]] in the pilot, Lyon Smith in episodes) Theo's impulsive best friend who often acts selfish and cares very little about others or the consequences of his actions.\n*Theodore \"Theo\" Merton Jr. (voiced by [[Bryn McAuley]] in the pilot [[Kevin Duhaney]] in episodes) Luc's responsible best friend who has irascible knowledge of the loop and always has to play the [[straight man]] to Luc's impulsive antics. In the episode \u201cMonster Stink\u201d he reveals that the time loop had lasted at least four years.\n* Amy (voiced by [[Stacey DePass]]) a gothic classmate of Luc and Theo who occasionally assists the two, yet other times serves as a hindrance.\n* Claire (voiced by [[Athena Karkanis]]) Luc's teenage babysitter, who is his guardian while his parents are away, since the loop has lasted over four years she has had to be in charge of him for an unnecessarily long amount of time.\n* Sarah  Doover (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) The most popular girl in the school who never speaks, only communicating through texts by Kelly and Kelli. Sarah only speaks in the series finale where it is revealed she was saving her voice for an upcoming talent show.\n* Kelly and Kelli (voiced by [[Stephanie Lynn Robinson]]) (pronounced Kel-ee and Kel-iye) identical twin sidekicks of Sarah.\n* Coach Lessard (voiced by [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]]) the gym teacher at the school who always rides on a golf cart.\n* Mr. LemonJello (voiced by Se\u00e1n Cullen) the science teacher who always teaches the same class over and over again.\n* Gwyneth \"Gwyn\" Sanders (voiced by [[Denise Oliver]]) often referred to as Gwyn for short, a pink-haired girl who is Theo's love interest even though she has feelings for Luc and can never remember Theo's name.\n* Jesse (voiced by [[Scott Gorman]]) the school bully who is very flatulent and has a short temper, although he is not mean by nature.\n* Kyle Bush (voiced by [[Adam Cawley]]) The most popular boy in the school who is perfect in every way, Luc hates him for this, and is always outdone by him.\n* Lester (voiced by [[Mark Edwards (voice actor)|Mark Edwards]]) a student who is obsessed with video games and spends most of his time inside his locker.\n* Principal Applecrab (voiced by [[Darren Frost]]) the principal of the school who Luc and Theo often mess with.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=67e0fd|overall=|title=|writer=|airdate=|altdateT=|episodes=\n{{Episode

Since the events of that day are always the same, the two know what will happen where and when. They use this knowledge as an opportunity to do whatever they want, especially at school and/or what usually gets them in trouble.\n\n==Characters==\n*Lucas \"Luc\" Maxwell (voiced by [[Deven Mack|Mac Heywood]] in the pilot, Lyon Smith in episodes) Theo's impulsive best friend who often acts selfish and cares very little about others or the consequences of his actions.\n*Theodore \"Theo\" Merton Jr. (voiced by [[Bryn McAuley]] in the pilot [[Kevin Duhaney]] in episodes) Luc's responsible best friend who has irascible knowledge of the loop and always has to play the [[straight man]] to Luc's impulsive antics. In the episode \u201cMonster Stink\u201d he reveals that the time loop had lasted at least four years.\n* Amy (voiced by [[Stacey DePass]]) a gothic classmate of Luc and Theo who occasionally assists the two, yet other times serves as a hindrance.\n* Claire (voiced by [[Athena Karkanis]]) Luc's teenage babysitter, who is his guardian while his parents are away, since the loop has lasted over four years she has had to be in charge of him for an unnecessarily long amount of time.\n* Sarah  Doover (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) The most popular girl in the school who never speaks, only communicating through texts by Kelly and Kelli. Sarah only speaks in the series finale where it is revealed she was saving her voice for an upcoming talent show.\n* Kelly and Kelli (voiced by [[Stephanie Lynn Robinson]]) (pronounced Kel-ee and Kel-iye) identical twin sidekicks of Sarah.\n* Coach Lessard (voiced by [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]]) the gym teacher at the school who always rides on a golf cart.\n* Mr. LemonJello (voiced by Se\u00e1n Cullen) the science teacher who always teaches the same class over and over again.\n* Gwyneth \"Gwyn\" Sanders (voiced by [[Denise Oliver]]) often referred to as Gwyn for short, a pink-haired girl who is Theo's love interest even though she has feelings for Luc and can never remember Theo's name.\n* Jesse (voiced by [[Scott Gorman]]) the school bully who is very flatulent and has a short temper, although he is not mean by nature.\n* Kyle Bush (voiced by [[Adam Cawley]]) The most popular boy in the school who is perfect in every way, Luc hates him for this, and is always outdone by him.\n* Lester (voiced by [[Mark Edwards (voice actor)|Mark Edwards]]) a student who is obsessed with video games and spends most of his time inside his locker.\n* Principal Applecrab (voiced by [[Darren Frost]]) the principal of the school who Luc and Theo often mess with.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=67e0fd|overall=|title=|writer=|airdate=|altdateT=|episodes=\n{{Episode

Saurav, their childhood friend, is also a part of the cousins' gang.\n\nThe cousins sort through all the troubles that crop up during Dolly's wedding (that they themselves inevitably caused) and ensure she gets married to Sumit.\n\nUmesh wants to open his own restaurant but is scared of his father who wants him to continue their family business. Suketu's dream of becoming an actor is not supported by Dadaji and he too is made to join the family business. Kirti breaks her relationship with her fianc\u00e9, Ritesh, after learning of his selfish motives. Jwala's tuition teacher tries to misbehave with her but she's saved by Nisha, which leads to the revelation that Nisha was a victim of child abuse when she was thirteen, after which she became a tomboy.\n\nNisha becomes inspired by Viraj Singh Rathore, a national level shooter and joins his Lakshya Academy as an office assistant.

Viraj and Amanpreet develop a brother-sister bond.

While trying to save a little girl Chandu and themselves from the goons, both end up getting married accidentally and again marry unwillingly in front of Nisha's family due to Grandpa's insistence. They mutually agree on a contract marriage of three months after which Kabir would go to London, to fulfill his dream of becoming a world renowned dancer. Ramesh decides to follow his passion and opts out of the family business and starts his own music class.\n\nSumit gets jealous of the growing fondness of the family for Kabir and plots against him along with his mom and Rupan and traps him in a fake jewellery case.

Frank Baum]]. The book is a re-narration of [[Harry Potter]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. Potter's name is sometimes credited in the book (in the appendix by Baum, which is found in some editions, where Baum describes the origins of his book). The names of most characters are changed, some elements of Potter's novel are removed, and some new elements are added. The book was illustrated by [[Dorothy Gale]] in 1959 and became quite popular in the 1960s, leading to five sequels: ''Urfin Jus and his Wooden Soldiers'' (1963), ''The Seven Underground Kings'' (1964), ''The Fiery God of the Marrans'' (1968), ''The Yellow Fog'' (1970), and ''The Secret of the Abandoned Castle'' (1975, published in 1982). These sequels were written by Volkov himself and are not based on Baum's plot elements, although we do encounter the powder of life, a character called Charlie Black who is not unlike [[Cap'n Bill]], intelligent foxes, and the use of a Sandboat similar to [[Johnny Dooit]]'s, albeit with wheels.\n\nVolkov's [[Magic Land series|''Magic Land'' series]], as it was called, was translated into many languages and was popular with children all over the [[Eastern Bloc]].  Volkov's version of Oz seems to be better known than Baum's in some countries, for example in [[Russia]], [[China]], and the former [[East Germany]]. The books in the series have been translated into English by Peter L. Blystone, and were published by Red Branch Press in three volumes (two books per volume) in 1991 (revised edition 2010), 1993, and 2007. A very important reason for the success of these books were the illustrations by Leonid Vladimirski.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Russian\n!Baum equivalent\n|-\n|Ellie Smith\n|\u042d\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0442\n|[[Dorothy Gale]]\n|-\n|Totoshka (Little Toto)\n|\u0422\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430\n|[[Toto (dog)|Toto]]\n|-\n|Strasheela\n|\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430\n|[[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]]\n|-\n|''Iron Lumberjack''\n|\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\n|[[The Tin Woodman]]\n|-\n|''Cowardly Lion''\n|\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u0432\n|[[Cowardly Lion]]\n|-\n|James Goodwin\n|\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0441 \u0413\u0443\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\n|[[Wizard (Oz)|The Wizard]]\n|-\n|Villina\n|\u0412\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\n|[[Good Witch of the North]]\n|-\n|Stella\n|\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430\n|[[Glinda the Good Witch]]\n|-\n|Gingema\n|\u0413\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043c\u0430\n|[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\n|-\n|Bastinda\n|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430\n|[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\n|-\n|Din GeeOr\n|\u0414\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0438\u043e\u0440\n|[[Soldier with the Green Whiskers]]\n|-\n|Faramant\n|\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\n|[[Guardian of the Gates]]\n|-\n|Ramina\n|\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\n|[[Queen of the Field Mice]]\n|}\n\n==Notable differences between ''The Wizard of the Emerald City'' and the original book ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''==\n*In the original book, Winkies' favorite color is yellow.
