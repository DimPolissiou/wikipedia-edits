Each episode begins with the crew touring the investigation site with its owners or caretakers. These introductions typically include Bagans's voice-overs of the site's history as well as interviews with people who claim to have witnessed [[paranormal phenomena]] there. On the basis of these interviews, the crew place X's with black or gray tape at the sites of some serious alleged paranormal activity. They later return to these spots in order to set up static night-vision cameras to try and film it happening.\n\nAfter completing the walk-through, they discuss their strategy, then are locked in the location overnight, which they believe will prevent \"audio contamination\" and extraneous shadows. They use a variety of equipment, including digital thermometers, [[electromagnetic field]] (EMF) [[EMF measurement|meters]], handheld digital video cameras, audio recorders, the Ovilus device, point of view cameras, and infrared night-vision cameras in an effort to capture evidence of ghosts. The members sometimes place objects and shout verbal taunts they believe ghosts might move or respond to.\n\nThe video and audio collected during each investigation is analyzed after the investigation, and the whole thing is cut down to fit one hour. The most prominent pieces of evidence found are then presented at the appropriate times they happened during the investigation and each one is explained. \n\nDuring the series, the crew claims to have captured and experienced various [[Forteana|Fortean phenomena]], which they say include simultaneous equipment malfunctions such as battery drain, voltage spikes, fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, sudden changes in temperature (such as [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]]s), unexplained noises, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]] (EVP), and [[ghost|apparitions]].\n\nThe crew also claim to have recorded [[spirit possession]]s on video.

Her published novels include ''13 Little Blue Envelopes'', ''The Name of the Star'', ''Truly Devious,'' and ''Suite Scarlett''. Among Johnson's works are collaborative efforts such as ''[[Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances|Let It Snow]],'' a holiday romance novel of interwoven stories co-written with [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and [[Lauren Myracle]], and a series of novellas found in anthologies ''The Bane Chronicles'', ''Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy'', and ''Ghosts of the Shadow Market.''\n\n==Early life and education==\nJohnson was born in [[Philadelphia]] and attended an all-girl [[Catholicism|Catholic]] preparatory high school. She graduated from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1995 with a degree in English.<ref>http://www1.udel.edu/udmessenger/vol20no1/stories/alumni-johnson-testerman.html</ref> Johnson later worked variously as literary manager of a Philadelphia theater company, a waitress in a theme restaurant, a secretary, a bartender in [[Piccadilly]], and an occasional performer in [[New York City]]. She studied both writing and theatrical dramaturgy at [[Columbia University]], where she received her [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Writing.<ref>[http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/about/ Official Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325053451/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/about/ |date=March 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Career and writings==\n[[File:(cropped) American authors Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson signing at LA Times Festival of Books 2012.png|alt=Johnson, at right, along with fellow author Lauren Myracle at left while signing at the LA Times Festival of Books in 2012.|left|thumb|Johnson, at right, along with fellow author Lauren Myracle at left while signing at the LA Times Festival of Books in 2012.]]\n\n=== First works ===\nJohnson's debut novel ''The Key to the Golden Firebird'' was published in May 2004 by [[HarperCollins|HarperTeen]]. Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. ''The Key to the Golden Firebird'' entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/26/15841216/outsiders-harry-potter-ya-young-adult-se-hinton-jk-rowling|title=The Outsiders reinvented young adult fiction.

Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood\u2014 Nina, Avery, and Melanie\u2014 two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, ''The Bermudez Triangle'' explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library's]] \u201cBooks for the Teen Age 2006\u201d, and the [[American Library Association|American Library Association\u2019s]] Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list.\n\nJohnson's third novel and first series, ''[[13 Little Blue Envelopes]]'' was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed \"Runaway Aunt\" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Johnson herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be \"a little bit of a fairy tale,\" and has cited the song \"Charmed Life\" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maureen Jonhson Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgymwNeuRmw|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/podcasts/13_Little_Blue_Envelopes.mp3|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-10-11|access-date=2019-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114359/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/podcasts/13_Little_Blue_Envelopes.mp3|archive-date=2007-10-11}}</ref> ''The Last Little Blue Envelope'', the sequel to Johnson's 2005 novel, ''[[13 Little Blue Envelopes]]'', was later published in April 2011.<ref>[http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/books/the-last-little-blue-envelope/ The Last Little Blue Envelope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517144618/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/books/the-last-little-blue-envelope/|date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, Johnson's fourth novel ''Devilish'' was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then [[Penguin Random House|Penguin Group]]. Set in a [[College-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Rhode Island]] where \"barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,\" ''Devilish'' follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's [[soul]]. Marking Johnson's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, ''Devilish'' was shortlisted in 2007 for the [[Andre Norton Award]], which celebrates excellence in [[Young adult fiction|YA]] [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novel writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2006/|title=2006|last=Fictions|first=\u00a9 2019 Science|last2=America|first2=Fantasy Writers of|website=The Nebula Awards\u00ae|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29|last3=SFWA\u00ae|first3=Inc|last4=Fiction|first4=Nebula Awards\u00ae are registered trademarks of Science|last5=America|first5=Fantasy Writers of|last6=SFWA|first6=Inc Opinions expressed on this web site are not necessarily those of}}</ref>\n\n=== Series ===\nIn May 2008, Johnson's sixth novel ''Suite Scarlett'' was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small \u201cjewel box of a hotel\u201d built at the height of [[Art Deco architecture of New York City|Art Deco]] style in the heart of Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. ''Scarlett'' explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of [[New York City]] for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the [[performing arts]]. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. ''Suite Scarlett'' was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist.\n\nIn September 2011, Johnson's tenth novel ''The Name of the Star'' was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the ''Shades of London'' series, ''The Name of the Star'' follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of [[Jack the Ripper]].<ref>Citation error.

The novel follows seventeen-year-old Clio Ford's attempts to make the best of being suddenly cast away from her home for the summer in pursuit of a mysterious treasure abroad. Set primarily aboard a pre-owned yacht somewhere amidst the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] at the behest of her father, it explores Clio's perspective as she struggles with first romantic infatuations, dives at sea among shipwrecks, and navigates a series of new relationships and situations.\n\nIn May 2009, Johnson contributed her story \"The Law of Suspects\" to ''Vacations from Hell'', a collection of supernatural tales on the topic of vacations gone awry, along with fellow authors [[Libba Bray]], Cassandra Clare, Claudia Gray, and Sarah Mlynowski.\n\nOn November 27, 2009, Johnson first became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Selling author]] when ''Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances'' (October 2008, Speak) reached number ten on the Children's Paperback list.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html New York Times Bestselling Children's Books, November 27, 2009]</ref> A holiday romance novel of interwoven stories co-written with [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and [[Lauren Myracle]], ''Let It Snow'' begins with Johnson's \"[[Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances#The%20Jubilee%20Express|The Jubilee Express]]\".

As described by Johnson at the time:<blockquote>''When there\u2019s a disaster, Shelterbox deploys trained volunteers (hardcore people who\u2019ve done survival training) with their special shelters in a box. The kits vary, but all contain the basic life-sustaining materials people need to survive after a disaster. Tents that fit families of ten. Blankets. A stove. Tools. You can get a good look at the kits here. Use your mouse to examine the various contents. Each box costs \u00a3590 (about $950) and literally puts a roof over someone\u2019s head.''</blockquote>Funds were raised through a general call to action and the giving away of signed ARCs (advance reader copies of books) and other literary materials to donors. The prizes themselves were donated by various authors in support of the aid effort. Donors were asked to make contributions to the charity directly, while sharing a common label so that their total as a group could be tracked. The amount raised was $15,202 USD, enough to fund 16 shelters and supplies.\n\nWeeks later, when the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] occurred, Johnson returned to Twitter with fellow authors to attempt to replicate the aid that was raised, this time with the people of Japan and anyone directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/11/shelterbox-in-japan/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTERBOX IN JAPAN|date=2011-03-15|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315022449/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/11/shelterbox-in-japan/|archive-date=2011-03-15}}</ref> Almost the same amount of money was raised, totaling $14,202 USD<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/13/shelterbox-in-japan-the-results/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTERBOX IN JAPAN: THE RESULTS!|date=2012-03-20|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320184711/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/13/shelterbox-in-japan-the-results/|archive-date=2012-03-20}}</ref>, enough for an additional 14 shelter kits to be deployed to those who needed them.\n\nIn May, in response to the [[2011 Joplin tornado|tornado in Joplin, Missouri]], Johnson and fellow authors used the same strategy to raise an additional $4,913.90 USD, with funds split between ShelterBox and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/05/23/shelter-for-joplin/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTER FOR JOPLIN|date=2013-05-14|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514021753/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/05/23/shelter-for-joplin/|archive-date=2013-05-14}}</ref>\n\nJohnson has continued to advocate publicly via social media for awareness on behalf of ShelterBox at times of disaster and particular need.\n\n== Other creative projects ==\n\n=== VlogBrothers ===\nIn January 2010, Johnson was acknowledged as [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''secret sister'' on the popular [[YouTube]] channel [[Vlogbrothers|VlogBrothers]]. With the reveal of this honorary title, Johnson took on the role of creating videos for the channel during his absence to paternity leave. Johnson later reprised the duty after the birth of Green's second child in 2013.\n\n=== Welcome to Night Vale ===\nSince June 2014, Johnson has voiced the character Intern Maureen on the surreal fiction podcast ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]'', as well as occasionally performed the character live on stage. In June 2016, while in conversation at [[92nd Street Y|92Y]] in New York, co-creator Joseph Fink explained that the character of Intern Maureen was initially written in the image of Johnson, but quickly killed off, as death is a kind of tradition for most interns of the Night Vale Radio station. Johnson, a vocal fan<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/368933183032528896|title=Now that I've found @NightValeRadio, I don't need superfluities, like scuba, or wifi, or food, or clothes.

Intern Maureen's continued survival has since become an ongoing joke within the stories. Johnson provided the foreword for ''The Great Glowing Coils of the Universe'' (Harper Perennial, 2016), a collected volume of early podcast scripts.\n\n=== Says Who? ===\nIn September 2016, Johnson began co-hosting the podcast ''[http://www.sayswhopodcast.com Says Who?]'' alongside former [[Punk Planet]] editor and author Dan Sinker. Self-described as a coping strategy, ''Says Who?'' was originally conceived as an eight-week project in which Johnson and Sinker would talk with political experts about how they were surviving news coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. The podcast has since continued past the results of the election, and switched to a biweekly format in which the hosts attempt to humorously discuss the news of the day, and more personally, share how they are coping as citizens in the current political era.\n\n==Personal life==\nJohnson lives in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1023306629058637825|title=I have lived in NYC since 1997!|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2018-07-28|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A self-described [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] since 1994, she has frequently shared her love for both vegan and vegetarian cooking through blog posts and tweets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/38423732288491520|title=\"@sundust When did you become a vegetarian, and why?\" In 1994, and FOR MANY REASONS.|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2011-02-17|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> \"I'm a vegetarian from Philadelphia, which means I spend my life trying to make a vegetarian steak sandwich.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1023306178967887877|title=I'm a vegetarian from Philadelphia, which means I spend my life trying to make a vegetarian steak sandwich.|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2018-07-28|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 2018, Johnson was married in New York's [[Central Park]] at the [[The Ramble and Lake|Ladies Pavilion]].

Among Johnson's works are collaborative efforts such as ''[[Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances|Let It Snow]],'' a holiday romance novel of interwoven stories co-written with [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and [[Lauren Myracle]], and a series of novellas found in anthologies ''The Bane Chronicles'', ''Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy'', and ''Ghosts of the Shadow Market.''\n\n==Early life and education==\nJohnson was born in [[Philadelphia]] and attended an all-girl [[Catholicism|Catholic]] preparatory high school.

Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. ''The Key to the Golden Firebird'' entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/26/15841216/outsiders-harry-potter-ya-young-adult-se-hinton-jk-rowling|title=The Outsiders reinvented young adult fiction.

Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood\u2014 Nina, Avery, and Melanie\u2014 two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, ''The Bermudez Triangle'' explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library's]] \u201cBooks for the Teen Age 2006\u201d, and the [[American Library Association|American Library Association\u2019s]] Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list.\n\nJohnson's third novel and first series, ''[[13 Little Blue Envelopes]]'' was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed \"Runaway Aunt\" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Johnson herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be \"a little bit of a fairy tale,\" and has cited the song \"Charmed Life\" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maureen Jonhson Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgymwNeuRmw|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/podcasts/13_Little_Blue_Envelopes.mp3|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-10-11|access-date=2019-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114359/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/podcasts/13_Little_Blue_Envelopes.mp3|archive-date=2007-10-11}}</ref> ''The Last Little Blue Envelope'', the sequel to Johnson's 2005 novel, ''[[13 Little Blue Envelopes]]'', was later published in April 2011.<ref>[http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/books/the-last-little-blue-envelope/ The Last Little Blue Envelope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517144618/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/books/the-last-little-blue-envelope/|date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, Johnson's fourth novel ''Devilish'' was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then [[Penguin Random House|Penguin Group]]. Set in a [[College-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Rhode Island]] where \"barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,\" ''Devilish'' follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's [[soul]]. Marking Johnson's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, ''Devilish'' was shortlisted in 2007 for the [[Andre Norton Award]], which celebrates excellence in [[Young adult fiction|YA]] [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novel writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2006/|title=2006|last=Fictions|first=\u00a9 2019 Science|last2=America|first2=Fantasy Writers of|website=The Nebula Awards\u00ae|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29|last3=SFWA\u00ae|first3=Inc|last4=Fiction|first4=Nebula Awards\u00ae are registered trademarks of Science|last5=America|first5=Fantasy Writers of|last6=SFWA|first6=Inc Opinions expressed on this web site are not necessarily those of}}</ref>\n\n=== Series ===\nIn May 2008, Johnson's sixth novel ''Suite Scarlett'' was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small \u201cjewel box of a hotel\u201d built at the height of [[Art Deco architecture of New York City|Art Deco]] style in the heart of Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. ''Scarlett'' explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of [[New York City]] for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the [[performing arts]]. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. ''Suite Scarlett'' was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist.\n\nIn September 2011, Johnson's tenth novel ''The Name of the Star'' was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the ''Shades of London'' series, ''The Name of the Star'' follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of [[Jack the Ripper]].<ref>Citation error.

As described by Johnson at the time:<blockquote>''When there\u2019s a disaster, Shelterbox deploys trained volunteers (hardcore people who\u2019ve done survival training) with their special shelters in a box. The kits vary, but all contain the basic life-sustaining materials people need to survive after a disaster. Tents that fit families of ten. Blankets. A stove. Tools. You can get a good look at the kits here. Use your mouse to examine the various contents. Each box costs \u00a3590 (about $950) and literally puts a roof over someone\u2019s head.''</blockquote>Funds were raised through a general call to action and the giving away of signed ARCs (advance reader copies of books) and other literary materials to donors. The prizes themselves were donated by various authors in support of the aid effort. Donors were asked to make contributions to the charity directly, while sharing a common label so that their total as a group could be tracked. The amount raised was $15,202 USD, enough to fund 16 shelters and supplies.\n\nWeeks later, when the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] occurred, Johnson returned to Twitter with fellow authors to attempt to replicate the aid that was raised, this time with the people of Japan and anyone directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/11/shelterbox-in-japan/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTERBOX IN JAPAN|date=2011-03-15|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315022449/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/11/shelterbox-in-japan/|archive-date=2011-03-15}}</ref> Almost the same amount of money was raised, totaling $14,202 USD<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/13/shelterbox-in-japan-the-results/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTERBOX IN JAPAN: THE RESULTS!|date=2012-03-20|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320184711/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/03/13/shelterbox-in-japan-the-results/|archive-date=2012-03-20}}</ref>, enough for an additional 14 shelter kits to be deployed to those who needed them.\n\nIn May, in response to the [[2011 Joplin tornado|tornado in Joplin, Missouri]], Johnson and fellow authors used the same strategy to raise an additional $4,913.90 USD, with funds split between ShelterBox and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/05/23/shelter-for-joplin/|title=Maureen Johnson Books \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb SHELTER FOR JOPLIN|date=2013-05-14|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514021753/http://www.maureenjohnsonbooks.com/2011/05/23/shelter-for-joplin/|archive-date=2013-05-14}}</ref>\n\nJohnson has continued to advocate publicly via social media for awareness on behalf of ShelterBox at times of disaster and particular need.\n\n== Other creative projects ==\n\n=== VlogBrothers ===\nIn January 2010, Johnson was acknowledged as [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''secret sister'' on the popular [[YouTube]] channel [[Vlogbrothers|VlogBrothers]]. With the reveal of this honorary title, Johnson took on the role of creating videos for the channel during his absence to paternity leave. Johnson later reprised the duty after the birth of Green's second child in 2013.\n\n=== Welcome to Night Vale ===\nSince June 2014, Johnson has voiced the character Intern Maureen on the surreal fiction podcast ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]'', as well as occasionally performed the character live on stage. In June 2016, while in conversation at [[92nd Street Y|92Y]] in New York, co-creator Joseph Fink explained that the character of Intern Maureen was initially written in the image of Johnson, but quickly killed off, as death is a kind of tradition for most interns of the Night Vale Radio station. Johnson, a vocal fan<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/368933183032528896|title=Now that I've found @NightValeRadio, I don't need superfluities, like scuba, or wifi, or food, or clothes. Night Vale takes care of me.|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2013-08-17|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> of the podcast, in turn led a Twitter campaign in protest, leading Fink and Cranor to agree to bring the character back on the condition that Johnson perform the role herself. Intern Maureen's continued survival has since become an ongoing joke within the stories. Johnson provided the foreword for ''The Great Glowing Coils of the Universe'' (Harper Perennial, 2016), a collected volume of early podcast scripts.\n\n=== Says Who? ===\nIn September 2016, Johnson began co-hosting the podcast ''[http://www.sayswhopodcast.com Says Who?]'' alongside former [[Punk Planet]] editor and author Dan Sinker. Self-described as a coping strategy, ''Says Who?'' was originally conceived as an eight-week project in which Johnson and Sinker would talk with political experts about how they were surviving news coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. The podcast has since continued past the results of the election, and switched to a biweekly format in which the hosts attempt to humorously discuss the news of the day, and more personally, share how they are coping as citizens in the current political era.\n\n==Personal life==\nJohnson lives in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1023306629058637825|title=I have lived in NYC since 1997!|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2018-07-28|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A self-described [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] since 1994, she has frequently shared her love for both vegan and vegetarian cooking through blog posts and tweets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/38423732288491520|title=\"@sundust When did you become a vegetarian, and why?\" In 1994, and FOR MANY REASONS.|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2011-02-17|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> \"I'm a vegetarian from Philadelphia, which means I spend my life trying to make a vegetarian steak sandwich.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1023306178967887877|title=I'm a vegetarian from Philadelphia, which means I spend my life trying to make a vegetarian steak sandwich.|last=Johnson|first=Maureen|date=2018-07-28|website=@maureenjohnson|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 2018, Johnson was married in New York's [[Central Park]] at the [[The Ramble and Lake|Ladies Pavilion]].

Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area.

Jan, Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some.

Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]].

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa|title=Johannesburg|last=Campbell|first=James T.|date=19 August 2015|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Traffic in the midst of the rain and fog.jpg|thumb|Rain and fog in July 2016]]\n[[File:A Johannesburg Summers Day.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of summer rain clouds over Johannesburg.

The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement.

The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as [[IBM]], [[Absa Group Limited|Absa]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Willis Group]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]], [[Nedbank]] and [[Standard Bank]]. Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe minibus \"taxis\" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population.

The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].\n\n[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs.

It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\n\nJohannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg. The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] and [[M2 road (Johannesburg)|M2]] freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre.

While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.\n\nThe Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.\n\nThe container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest \"[[dry port]]\" in the world,{{Citation needed|reason=Johannesburg not mentioned in dry port article, largest dry port in world is significant claim|date=March 2015}} with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting.

Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg|title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg - The Heritage Portal|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}\n[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886]]\nThe region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools.

Jan, Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some.

The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col [[Ignatius Ferreira]], was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because the water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]].

The economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of cheap black workers who performed most of the semi-skilled and unskilled work, and which forced the government to make some exceptions to ''apartheid'' in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 86.</ref> In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for blacks outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\"/> [[Soweto]], a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of rural blacks came to Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 92.</ref> It was estimated in 1989 that the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/>\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatbeeld in Johannesburg TMnr 10004282.jpg|thumb|Street scene in Johannesburg in 1970]]\nIn March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against ''apartheid'' in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 80.</ref> On 11 July 1963, the [[South African Police]] raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Rivonia]] where nine members of the banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/> The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, two whites and six blacks, one of whom was the future president [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 91.</ref> At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to ''apartheid'' and failed, leaving him with no other choice.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/> The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to ''apartheid''.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/>\n \t\nOn 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against ''apartheid'' began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 93.</ref> About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the [[Soweto uprising]] of 1976.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\"/> Between 1984\u201386, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against  ''apartheid'', and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-''apartheid'' demonstrators.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 100.</ref>\n\nThe central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres.

It was known throughout its redevelopment as the Newtown cultural precinct it was therefore important to stage, old renovated buildings as the setting of the new precinct. Demolishing the old structures and replacing them with new buildings would not have achieved the same effect. Everyone played their part in the marketing, branding and the new identity of the precinct, the City, heritage bodies, heritage practitioners, private companies all played a part. The old warehouse industrial buildings that once lay decaying in Newtown are now synonymous with culture and flair.\n\nLike many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg.  One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the CBD.  Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels.  Maboneng calls itself \"a place of inspiration \u2013 a creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents.

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa|title=Johannesburg|last=Campbell|first=James T.|date=19 August 2015|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Traffic in the midst of the rain and fog.jpg|thumb|Rain and fog in July 2016]]\n[[File:A Johannesburg Summers Day.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of summer rain clouds over Johannesburg.

The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].\n\nGreater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\":0\"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.\n\nTraditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\n\n== Cityscape ==\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.  Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.\n\nDue to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}.

Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination.

The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].\n\n[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs.

It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\n\nJohannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg.

Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in [[Hillbrow]] and the city centre.\n\nAs part of the Johannesburg Development Agency's (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=JDA's PUBLIC ART STRATEGY 2011-2016|url=http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf|website=www.jda.org.za|publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency|accessdate=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401054603/http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf|archive-date=1 April 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Place making and public art|url=http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city|website=www.jda.org.za|publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency|accessdate=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210050/http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city|archive-date=31 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Crime ==\nAfter the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]] and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]].

They are based at the city's [[FNB Stadium|FNB]], [[Orlando Stadium|Orlando]], [[Dobsonville Stadium|Dobsonville]] and [[Bidvest Stadium|Bidvest]] stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at [[Soccer City]] the venue of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] final. First Division teams are [[Jomo Cosmos]] and [[FC AK]].\nKatlehong City and Alexandra United, play at [[Alexandra Stadium|Alexandra]] and Reiger Park stadium respectively.\n\n=== Cricket ===\nCricket is one of the more popular sports.

The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.\n\nThe Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.\n\nThe container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest \"[[dry port]]\" in the world,{{Citation needed|reason=Johannesburg not mentioned in dry port article, largest dry port in world is significant claim|date=March 2015}} with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|\"receiving house\"]] of live entertainment\u2014presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.\n\nShopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]]. See [[Johannesburg#Retail|above]]. (Cultural) tourists also visit the \"Mai Mai Market\"<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 Mai Mai Market] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145111/https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 |date=14 November 2017 }}, joburg.org.za</ref> (\"Ezinyangeni\"&nbsp;\u2013 the place of healers; located on the eastern wing of the city centre) dedicated to traditional herbs and [[sangoma|traditional healers]].\n\nThe [[Cradle of Humankind]] a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is {{convert|25|km}} to the northwest of the city. The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the [[Human evolution#Out of Africa|origins of humankind in Africa]], and houses an extensive collection of [[rock art]].\n\nJohannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view [[wildlife]], in addition to the [[Johannesburg Zoo]], one of the largest in South Africa. The [[Lion Park]] nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the [[Krugersdorp Nature Reserve]], a 1500 [[Hectare|ha]] [[game reserve]], is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewildt.co.za/|title=The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre - De Wildt|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> in the [[Magaliesberg]] runs a successful breeding program for [[cheetah]], [[African wild dog|wild dog]] and other [[endangered species]].
