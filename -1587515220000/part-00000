M. Renfield''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic Novel|Gothic]] horror novel ''[[Dracula]]''.<ref name=\"snotes\">[http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/characters.html Dracula.] SparkNotes; Character list.</ref>\n\n==In the novel==\nA description of Renfield from the novel:\n\n<blockquote>\nR. M. Renfield, [[List of Latin phrases: A#aetat|aetat]] 59. [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|Sanguine]] temperament, great physical strength, morbidly excitable,\nperiods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume that the\nsanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish,\na possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men, caution is as\nsecure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this point is,\nwhen self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal.\nWhen duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only\naccident or a series of accidents can balance it. \u2014 From Dr. [[John Seward]]'s journal\n</blockquote>\n\nRenfield is an inmate at the [[psychiatric hospital|lunatic asylum]] overseen by Dr. [[John Seward]]. He is thought to suffer from [[delusion]]s which compel him to eat living creatures in the hope of obtaining their life-force for himself. Later Renfield's own testimony reveals that Dracula would send him insects, which he begins consuming. He starts with [[fly|flies]], the [[Acherontia atropos|death's-head moth]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 21, Dr. Seward's Diary, 3 October|page=400|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=Just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining.

When denied a [[cat]] to accommodate the birds, he eats the birds himself. He also changes his ideas to accommodate [[Mina Harker]] by quickly eating all flies and stating that it was an old habit. Doctor John Seward diagnoses him as a \"[[wikt:zoophagia|zoophagous]] maniac\", or life-consuming madman. Later Renfield builds up his own courage to harm Dr. Seward, acquiring a knife and cutting his arm; as Seward's blood drips from his hand, Renfield licks it off the floor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Ch 11, Dr. Seward's Diary, 17 September|page=202|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the novel, the role of Renfield as a patient allows the reader to understand his behavior from the perspective of a psychologist. Through Renfield's demented mind, the reader learns the nature of a vampirism that is eventually revealed to be under the influence of [[Count Dracula]]; Renfield attempts to escape from the hospital multiple times to meet him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|pages=147, 156|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf}}</ref> The [[vampire]], whose abilities include control over animals such as [[rat]]s, [[bat]]s and [[spider]]s, comes to Renfield with an offer: if Renfield worships him, he promises to make him [[immortality|immortal]] by providing an endless supply of insects and rats, as Renfield believes that blood is the source of life.\n\nHowever, when confronted by Mina Harker, the object of Dracula's obsession, Renfield suffers an attack of [[conscience]] and begs her to flee from his master's grasp. Consumed by his desire to keep Mina safe, he begs Seward and the others to allow him to leave lest he feel guilty for her fate. When Seward denies his request, Renfield tells the vampire hunters that \"[he] warned them!\" When Dracula returns that night, Renfield is again seized by his conscience. He remembers hearing that madmen have unnatural strength, and so attempts to fight Dracula. Renfield's strength leaves him after looking into Dracula's eyes, and Dracula throws him to the floor, severely injuring him.\n\nThe vampire hunters enter the room shortly afterward, and through an emergency surgery Van Helsing manages to prolong Renfield's life. Renfield tells how Dracula convinced him to invite Dracula in, detailing how Dracula entered the home and went after Mina. They leave him lying on the floor to rescue her. During the party's confrontation with Dracula in Mina's room, they manage to repel him with their [[crucifix]]es and wafers of [[sacramental bread]], forcing him to flee the room. However, Dracula flees into other rooms and destroys their records, then back into Renfield's room to break his neck. \"When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr.  Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\"\n\n==Influence in psychology==\nThe character Renfield has influenced the study of real-life behavior in psychiatric patients suffering from an obsession with drinking blood. The term [[Clinical vampirism|Renfield syndrome]] was coined by psychologist [[Richard Noll]] in 1992, originally as a joke term, to describe [[clinical vampirism]]. Correspondingly, there is also a \"vampire personality disorder\" (VPD); a diagnosis for clinical vampirism, used for the [[offender profiling|behavioral profiling]] of [[serial killer]]s compelled by bloodlust and for patients who act out violent vampiric fantasies,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ramsland|first1=Katherine|title=Vampire Personality Disorder|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201211/vampire-personality-disorder|website=Psychology Today|quote=For ''The Science of Vampires'', I invented a diagnosis as well.

Initially the patient exhibits [[zoophagia]], a compulsion to eat insects, or to eat live animals or drink their blood. As the condition worsens, the behavior grows more and more deviant, culminating in a compulsion to drink another person's blood in an act described as True-Vampirism, including intentionally harming another individual for that purpose&nbsp;\u2014 the same behavior Renfield is seen exhibiting in the novel.\n\n==In other media==\n===On screen===\n\n* [[F.

Renfield is unquestioningly loyal to Dracula in the hope of one day being turned into a vampire, and seems to partly enjoy the abuse Dracula inflicts upon him when he makes mistakes. Renfield ultimately becomes a vampire in the series' concluding episodes, though he proves inept at using his new powers. Ludders also portrays Renfield's father, a cruel man who is resurrected and promptly enacts a plan to destroy the Draculas, but the younger Renfield ultimately undoes his resurrection.\n* Ian Pfister plays Renfield in ''[[Dracula Reborn]]'' (2012).

He is killed by Professor Van Helsing in the final episode when Renfield finds Van Helsing destroying the serum that allows the vampire to walk in the sunlight.\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] portrays Renfield in the third and final season of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014-2016).\n* Ewan Bailey voices Renfield in 2017 computer animated horror comedy ''[[Monster Family]]'', where he is Dracula's butler, who ultimately sides with protagonists against his master.\n* In November 2019, it was announced that a film titled ''Renfield'', centered around the titular character is in development. The project was greenlit by Universal Pictures, following a pitch for the project from [[Robert Kirkman]]. [[Dexter Fletcher]] will serve as director, from a script by Ryan Ridley. The film will be a joint-venture production with [[Skybound Entertainment]]. Kirkman, David Alpert, Bryan Furst, and Sean Furst will serve as producers.

Renfield is unquestioningly loyal to Dracula in the hope of one day being turned into a vampire, and seems to partly enjoy the abuse Dracula inflicts upon him when he makes mistakes. Renfield ultimately becomes a vampire in the series' concluding episodes, though he proves inept at using his new powers. Ludders also portrays Renfield's father, a cruel man who is resurrected and promptly enacts a plan to destroy the Draculas, but the younger Renfield ultimately undoes his resurrection.\n* Ian Pfister plays Renfield in ''[[Dracula Reborn]]'' (2012). The events take place in modern times in Los Angeles. Renfield is an associate of Dracula, who moved to California.\n* In [[NBC]] and [[Living (TV channel)|Sky Living]]'s 2013 [[Dracula (2013 TV series)|television series]], Renfield is portrayed by [[Nonso Anozie]].<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/dracula/about/bio/cast/nonso-anozie/748557/ Nonso Anozie Bio] NBC</ref> In contrast to other Renfields, this version is well-educated and fully sane, having been recruited by Dracula to act as his lawyer after Dracula met him on a train, serving as Dracula's confidante and with Dracula expressing complete faith in his loyalty. He is killed by Professor Van Helsing in the final episode when Renfield finds Van Helsing destroying the serum that allows the vampire to walk in the sunlight.\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] portrays Renfield in the third and final season of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014-2016).\n* Ewan Bailey voices Renfield in 2017 computer animated horror comedy ''[[Monster Family]]'', where he is Dracula's butler, who ultimately sides with protagonists against his master.\n* In November 2019, it was announced that a film titled ''Renfield'', centered around the titular character is in development. The project was greenlit by Universal Pictures, following a pitch for the project from [[Robert Kirkman]]. [[Dexter Fletcher]] will serve as director, from a script by Ryan Ridley. The film will be a joint-venture production with [[Skybound Entertainment]]. Kirkman, David Alpert, Bryan Furst, and Sean Furst will serve as producers. It's believed to take place during the present day and is not a period piece. <ref>{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Dexter Fletcher to Direct a Movie About Dracula\u2019s Henchman for Universal (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/|website=Variety|accessdate=November 20, 2019|date=November 20, 2019}}</ref> This take on the project is described as a comedic, lighthearted approach in the vein of [[Taika Waititi]]'s vampire mockumentary ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'', in which Renfield realizes he is in a bad, co-dependent relationship. <ref> https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rocketman-director-dexter-fletcher-robert-kirkman-tackling-universal-monster-movie-renfield-1256272</ref>\n* In the 2020 miniseries ''[[Dracula (2020 TV series)|Dracula]]'' the character, now named Frank Renfield, is depicted as Count Dracula's lawyer in 21st century Britain.

A combined [[Privateer|corsair]] expedition, mainly French (an Anglo-French fleet with Portuguese forces included), sailed against a Spanish naval force made up of Portuguese and Castilian ships, to preserve control of the Azores under pretender [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] and to defend the islands from incorporation into the [[Iberian Union]]&mdash;the largest French force sent overseas before the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref name=\"Glete-156\"/>\n\nIn the first engagement between large fleets of [[carracks]] and [[galleon]]s operating at great distances from the mainland,<ref>Walton p. 80</ref> the mercenary fleet under [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi]] was severely defeated by a squadron under [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n]].<ref>Hakluyt p. 418</ref> The [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] victory resulted in the rapid Spanish conquest of the Azores, completing the incorporation of [[Spanish Empire|Portugal into the Spanish Empire]].<ref>Nascimento Rodrigues/Tessaleno Devezas p. 122</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe only portion of the Portuguese overseas empire to resist the Habsburg King [[Philip II of Spain]] (Philip I of Portugal) were the Azores Islands.<ref name=\"Konstam p.44\">Konstam p.44</ref> The French crown sent a fleet under the command of the mercenary admiral [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Filipo Strozzi]] in order to help defend the islands.\n\nKing Philip had offered an amnesty to the seven islands if they would surrender,<ref name=\"History of Portugal p.269\">History of Portugal p.269</ref> but his messenger met with a very hostile reception at [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], and retired to the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], which had presented its allegiance to the King of Spain and Portugal.<ref name=\"History of Portugal p.269\"/>\n\nWhile a fleet was prepared at [[Lisbon]] to subdue the seven islands, a Spanish commander sent out to escort the incoming [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure fleet]], Pedro Vald\u00e9s, was ordered to deliver a new offer of pardon, but on no account to begin hostilities until the necessary force was assembled. However, receiving the same replies the former envoy, ''Vald\u00e9s'' was persuaded to attempt an assault on [[Terceira]].<ref name=\"History of Portugal p.269\"/> At what became known as the [[Battle of Salga]], his landing-force of 600 men met with a savage welcome; the half-wild bulls of the island were driven into them and they were cut to pieces as they fled to the ships.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Ant\u00f3nio]] reached [[Calais]] and proceeded to [[England]]. [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]] and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]] favoured the sending of an expedition to the Azores: the [[Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso|Count of Vimioso]] even made an agreement with [[Francis Drake|Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Hawkins]], but [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] was unwilling to make war on [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], and Ant\u00f3nio returned to France.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Terceira Azores seen by Linschoten.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''Map of [[Terceira]].'' By [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten|Jan Huygen van Linschoten]].]]\nIn June 1582 Ant\u00f3nio's French fleet left [[Belle \u00cele|Belle-Isle]], intending to subdue the two islands of S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria and to capture the [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] which would probably put in at the Azores.<ref>History of Portugal p.270</ref> However, on learning that Strozzi had sailed, Santa Cruz also made for the Azores with fewer ships but larger in size and arms than Strozzi and about an equal number of men. He arrived too late to prevent the French from landing on [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], but in time to save the capital, [[Ponta Delgada]].\n\nAfter an indecisive gunfight on 24 July 1582 the fleets met two days later in a fierce close battle south of the island of S\u00e3o Miguel.<ref name=\"Glete p.157\">Glete p.157</ref> The French initially had the advantage of the wind and attacked the Spanish rear with superior forces but that gave the Spanish commander the opportunity to gain the wind for the Spanish vanguard which in its turn attacked the French. The Spanish were outnumbered two to one,<ref>Angus Konstam p.45</ref> the brunt of the French attack was borne by the Portuguese-built Spanish galleon ''San Mateo'' (''S\u00e3o Mateus''), a vessel of 750 tonnes armed with 30 guns. Although surrounded, battered by artillery and boarded by several French ships, her sailors held their ground and repulsed all attacks.<ref name=\"Konstam p.44\"/> They then took the fight to the enemy, boarding and capturing two French vessels before the battle ended. Several French ships took flight. Santa Cruz began the action by arranging themselves in a line abreast.<ref name=\"Konstam p.44\"/> This was the traditional tactic employed by the Spanish galleys, which carried their few cannon in the bow.\n\n[[Alvaro de Baz\u00e1n|Santa Cruz]] in his Portuguese-built flagship ''[[S\u00e3o Martinho (1580)|S\u00e3o Martinho]]'' sought out Strozzi's ship amid the smoke and chaos and, having found her, pounded her with gunfire until she was close to sinking. At the battle's close, the Pretender's fleet had lost 10 ships sunk or captured, and well over 1,000 men, including [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Strozzi]],<ref>Parker p.72</ref> wounded to death by order of Santa Cruz, and then, still breathing, thrown into the sea. [[Alvaro de Baz\u00e1n|Santa Cruz]] defeated the French through a combination of gunfire and boarding.<ref>Walton p.80</ref>\n\nSome thought that Strozzi had been unlucky to lose. His ships had proved nimbler than those of [[Alvaro de Baz\u00e1n|Santa Cruz]], and, like [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|Hawkins at San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], they had used their artillery well, operating in mutually supporting groups of four ''to charge, and assail each of them one of the great vessels of the enemy''. The Spanish fleet suffered severe damage, Philip II's commemorative mural in the [[El Escorial|Escorial's]] Hall of Battles correctly depicts extensive shot damage on the Spanish side.\nThe galleon ''San Mart\u00edn'' (''S\u00e3o Martinho'') barely managed to tow the captured enemy flagship back to port.<ref name=\"Parker p.73\">Parker p.73</ref>\nOn July 26, after a five-hour naval engagement, the French and English fleets, weaker in battle-power, were routed; seventeen of their ships deserted. Men over seventeen who were captured were put to death as [[Piracy|pirates]]. This sentence seemed very cruel to all, so some of the Spanish soldiers and captains came forward to plead to Alvaro de Bazan for mercy, and suggested that he make an exemption for the French prisoners by sparing their lives as prisoners of war. Alvaro de Bazan responded by saying that he was only executing the \"mandates\" of the King of France, that being at peace with Castile would not allow his subjects to act as armed pirates attacking the Spaniards.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Desembarcoislasterceiras.jpg|thumb|235px|right|''The Spanish [[Tercio]]s landing on Terceira.'' [[El Escorial]] Hall of Battles.]]\nThough larger, the improvised French fleet had not been sufficient to challenge the Spanish in the Atlantic triangle.<ref name=\"Glete p.157\"/>  The magnitude of French losses is uncertain but they were heavy and decisive.\n\nIn spite of the effective use of artillery, the battle was largely decided in the traditional style of [[Naval boarding|boarding]] the enemy, although the Portuguese were the first to understand the importance of [[naval artillery]]. Apparently, Strozzi ignored the Portuguese who were in his fleet and recommended the use of artillery in their [[line of battle]] tactic, as they were doing in the Indian Ocean (resolving many battles by gunnery alone), and who would be adopted by the other Europeans in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.abc.es/historia-militar/20140611/abci-batalla-isla-terceira-mundo-201405291615.html] ''Batalla de la Isla Tercera \"El mundo no es suficiente para la Espa\u00f1a de Felipe II\"'' ABC - Historia militar de Espa\u00f1a, Cesar Cervera (in Spanish) - 2014.</ref> However, the battle shows that Strozzi tried, partly, an approximation to this tactic, by an attack by a group of naus engaged in ''formation''.<ref>''Os navios de Portugal na Grande Armada. O poder naval portugu\u00eas''. 1574-1592, Author: Augusto Salgado, Lisbon, Pref\u00e1cio, 2004, pages 18-29</ref>\n\nThe other problem for the French-allied fleet to win more easily with such tactical or approximate strategy, despite its numbers and the fact that several carracks in its fleet have more guns aboard than the galleon ''S\u00e3o Mateus'',<ref>''Os navios de Portugal na Grande Armada. O poder naval portugu\u00eas''. 1574-1592, Augusto Salgado, pages 18-29</ref> although the latter being robust and designed for greater maneuverability, was that of the Atlantic armed carracks, but especially, the Portuguese oceanic fighting galleons, were precisely incorporated into the Spanish fleet, and leading the fight (despite being only two, they would be decisive, being the other ships Portuguese and Castilian carracks, [[urca]]s, and [[patache]]s). These galleons were also strongly armed\u2014with its personnel and specialized ''bombardeiros'' or ''artilheiros''\u2014more suitable for such a strategy in the Atlantic high seas than other naus and galleons of more mixed-use, or the [[galleys]] (the widest Spanish resource for naval engagements until then). However, in the end, the battle was eventually largely resolved in the ''old way'' of [[naval warfare]].<ref>[http://www.revistanaval.com/www-alojados/armada/batallas/snmiguel.htm] ''Batalla de Isla Terceira (26 de julio de 1582): Felipe II consolida el trono de Portugal'' Revista Militar, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Cumplido Mu\u00f1oz</ref>\n\n[[Alvaro de Bazan|Santa Cruz]] had won a great victory and jubilation at his triumphant return seems to have gripped the whole of Spain.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The French ambassador at [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s court sourly reported that some Spaniards went so far as to claim that \"even Christ was no longer safe in Paradise, for the marquis might go there to bring him back and crucify him all over again\". Later some of this pride and passion turned against the vanquished: according to the same ambassador by October 1582 the Spaniards had taken to \"spitting in the faces of any Frenchmen they happened to meet in the street.\"<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/>\n\n[[Terceira]] remained in the Pretender's hands, and in the spring of 1583 he managed to reinforce his garrisons there with 800 fresh French troops. [[Alvaro de Bazan|Santa Cruz]], who now enjoyed command of the sea, reacted swiftly. Secure within his [[Lisbon]] base he prepared an amphibious invasion of overwhelming force: 15,372 men and 98 ships, including 31 big merchantmen converted as troop transports, small vessels and landing craft, fighting galleons, 12 galleys and 2 galleasses.<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/> This time his aim was not to fight a fleet but to land an army\u2014the task force could certainly defend itself if necessary, but its primary role was to put troops, together with their supporting equipment and supplies, on a selected beach-head and then to back them up until the military objectives had been gained.<ref>Parker p.74</ref>\n\nThe Terceirans expected the Spaniards to land at the harbours of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] and Peggia, and had disposed their forces accordingly. However, Santa Cruz decided to deliver his main thrust at Mole, a beach 10 miles from [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] defended only by light earthworks occupied by infantry with some artillery support.<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/> Bazan's own report of the landings describes the assault on the beaches:\n\n{{cquote|\"The flag galley began to batter and dismount the enemy artillery and the rest of the galleys did likewise.... the landing craft ran aground and placed soldiers on the flanks of the fortifications, and along the trenches, although with much difficulty and working under the pressure of the furious artillery, arquebus, and musket fire of the enemy. The soldiers mounting the trenches in several places came under heavy small-arms fire, but finally won the forts and trenches\".<ref>The Spanish Armada by Colin Martin/Geoffrey Parker p.73</ref>}}\n\n[[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Ant\u00f3nio]] himself was on [[Terceira]], where he supervised the raising of levies for defense, but left in November to persuade the French to furnish another 1,500 men, who arrived in June 1583.<ref name=\"Konstam p.44\"/> Santa Cruz had increased his fleet to ninety-six ships and 9,500 men with a garrison of 2,000 on [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]]. His lavish offers of mercy, marriage and money for Ant\u00f3nio's capitulation were refused, but after one day's fighting [[Terceira]] fell. French and English soldiers on the island were allowed to retire unharmed, but sixteen supporters of Ant\u00f3nio, including Silva, who had tried to flee on the night of the attack, were executed.

Later some of this pride and passion turned against the vanquished: according to the same ambassador by October 1582 the Spaniards had taken to \"spitting in the faces of any Frenchmen they happened to meet in the street.\"<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/>\n\n[[Terceira]] remained in the Pretender's hands, and in the spring of 1583 he managed to reinforce his garrisons there with 800 fresh French troops. [[Alvaro de Bazan|Santa Cruz]], who now enjoyed command of the sea, reacted swiftly. Secure within his [[Lisbon]] base he prepared an amphibious invasion of overwhelming force: 15,372 men and 98 ships, including 31 big merchantmen converted as troop transports, small vessels and landing craft, fighting galleons, 12 galleys and 2 galleasses.<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/> This time his aim was not to fight a fleet but to land an army\u2014the task force could certainly defend itself if necessary, but its primary role was to put troops, together with their supporting equipment and supplies, on a selected beach-head and then to back them up until the military objectives had been gained.<ref>Parker p.74</ref>\n\nThe Terceirans expected the Spaniards to land at the harbours of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] and Peggia, and had disposed their forces accordingly. However, Santa Cruz decided to deliver his main thrust at Mole, a beach 10 miles from [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] defended only by light earthworks occupied by infantry with some artillery support.<ref name=\"Parker p.73\"/> Bazan's own report of the landings describes the assault on the beaches:\n\n{{cquote|\"The flag galley began to batter and dismount the enemy artillery and the rest of the galleys did likewise.... the landing craft ran aground and placed soldiers on the flanks of the fortifications, and along the trenches, although with much difficulty and working under the pressure of the furious artillery, arquebus, and musket fire of the enemy.

His lavish offers of mercy, marriage and money for Ant\u00f3nio's capitulation were refused, but after one day's fighting [[Terceira]] fell.

Despite numerous setbacks, [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV of Spain]] was determined to crush the Portuguese insurrection. After a disastrous campaign in Southern Portugal culminated in the 1662 [[Battle of Ameixial]], the Spanish court re-evaluated the performance of the Spanish Army and came to the conclusion that the war could only be ended by decisive action. The court believed that the Portuguese insurrection could only be ended by the capture of a major Portuguese city or by the complete destruction of the Portuguese Army. [[Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena]], a veteran of campaigns in Italy and the Netherlands, was appointed to lead the new invasion of Portugal. Carrillo had served as a field commander and as a military governor, and his organizational skills were lauded. Carrillo planned to end the war by capturing the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]]. To reach the city, he planned first to take [[Vila Vi\u00e7osa]], followed by [[Set\u00fabal]].\n\nOnce he was in command, Carrillo wanted to gather his army's strength to ensue that he outnumbered whatever Portuguese army chose to engage him. However, the worsening illness of King Philip caused the court to order him to proceed with the invasion, as they feared that the death of Philip would strengthen foreign support for the Portuguese. The Spanish crown was also facing financial difficulties, and there was a legitimate fear that the army would have to be disbanded for lack of funds if the war continued.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of War in the Iberian Peninsula|last=Tuell|first=Marcus|publisher=William & Wilkins Publishing House|year=1952|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=242\u2013244|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Portuguese were prepared and had foreseen such an attack. 3,500 men were moved from [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (region)|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]] in the north to [[Alentejo]] in the south. A further 7,800 men came from [[Lisbon]], under command of [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Meneses]], who had defeated the Spanish in the [[Battle of the Lines of Elvas]] six years earlier. They were reinforced by a veteran [[English expedition to Portugal (1662\u20131668)|English contingent]] of 2,000 men under the command of the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Duke of Schomberg]].\n\nA veteran commander who had been defending the Portuguese border with Spain for over 20 years, Meneses was aware that there were any number of ways for Carrillo to invade the country. As such, he reinforced the border garrisons of [[Elvas]] and [[Campo Maior, Portugal|Campo Maior]], hoping to harden the frontier defenses and in doing so influence the route Carrillo would take. Having been present during the Portuguese victory at Ameixial, Meneses was well aware that the Spanish faced logistical challenges when invading Portugal, and as such he planned to keep Carrillo's army trapped in the border hinterlands as long as possible to wear down their numbers. The Portuguese were also conscious of the failing health of the Spanish king, and Meneses suspected that this would force them to attack.<ref name=\"Tuell, 242\">Tuell, 242</ref>\n\nCarrillo's army moved into Portugal on 25 May. He first took [[Borba (Portugal)|Borba]] without resistance after it was abandoned by the Portuguese garrison. He then laid siege to [[Vila Vi\u00e7osa]], which was better defended and offered a stiff resistance to the Spanish attackers.\n\nThe Portuguese decided to exchange land for time, as it was hoped that the rough terrain of the hinterlands would degrade Carrillo's army. Despite this strategy, Meneses was determined to engage the Spanish army on a battlefield of his choosing. The main body of the Portuguese army set itself in motion towards the Spanish force surrounding Vila Vi\u00e7osa, but it stopped in [[Montes Claros (Portugal)|Montes Claros]], halfway between Vila Vi\u00e7osa and [[Estremoz]].<ref name=\"Tuell, 242\"/><ref name=\":1\">White, L.

By June, attacks by Portuguese militias were taking a heavy toll on his lines of supply, Vila Vicosa continued to put up an unexpectedly fierce defense, and the Spanish court was demanding action. In spite of these setbacks, Carrillo continued to rely on his previous plans for the capture of Lisbon. However, when informed that Meneses's numerically inferior force was advancing on him from Estremoz, Carrillo decided to engage the Portuguese.\n\n==Battle==\nMeneses deployed his army in a defensive formation adjacent to and at the southern end of a long ridge. A dense forest and hills lay further to the south of the Portuguese positions. By defending the space between these two terrain features, Meneses planned to limit the number of Portuguese and Spanish soldiers fighting at any one time and as such counter the superior Spanish numbers. He positioned his heaviest infantry, composed of seasoned veterans, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries under the command of Frederic Schomberg in two lines in this gap and positioned his artillery to support them. The rest of the Portuguese army was held in reserve and ordered to prevent the Spanish from scaling the ridge line. Carrillo was well aware of the Portuguese defenses and massed his cavalry and artillery for an all out attack on the gap between the ridge and the forest.<ref name=\":0\">Tuell, 243-44</ref>\n\n[[File:Batalha de Montes Claros, tamb\u00e9m chamada de Vila Vi\u00e7osa (1668) - Gaspar Bouttats.png|thumb|Contemporary engraving of the battle]]\nThe battle opened with the Spanish artillery firing into the Portuguese positions, opening gaps in the first line of infantry. The Spanish cavalry then charged the Portuguese lines and overran several units. The Portuguese infantry organized themselves into squares to fend off the cavalry, but this left them vulnerable to the Spanish artillery. The Duke of Schomberg's men gathered around some buildings on the left flank of the Portuguese army, using the structures and a vineyard wall to break up the advancing mass of Spanish cavalry.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Portuguese cannon fired repeatedly into the ranks of Spanish cavalry, inflicting many casualties. As the first Spanish charge retreated, Meneses ordered his first line back and consolidated it into the second line. When a Spanish cannonball killed Sir [[Francisco da Silva Moura]], the commander of the Portuguese contingent of the second line, Meneses took command in person.<ref>McMurdo.</ref>\n\nA second Spanish cavalry attack and barrage again caused many casualties in the Portuguese infantry lines, but was forced to withdraw due to the Portuguese artillery.\n\nCarrillo then ordered a massive third charge, incorporating both cavalry and infantry, into the Portuguese defenses. The battle raged on and the fighting was extremely intense. The Duke of Schomberg had his horse shot from underneath him and was almost captured by the Spanish. The Portuguese artillery in particular was devastating as shot after shot was fired into the advancing mass of Spaniards, while the Spanish cannon were soon forced to cease in their firing for fear of hitting their own men. The assault collapsed, and Spanish infantry and cavalrymen were soon pressed tightly together, becoming easy targets for the Portuguese. The Spanish cavalry alone suffered over 1,200 casualties in the third charge against the Portuguese line.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=The History of Portugal - From the Reign of D.

The total Spanish casualties in this campaign to conquer Portugal amounted to 4,000 killed in the battlefield, 1,200 to 1,500 killed during the siege of Vila Vi\u00e7osa (before the battle), almost 1,500 fugitives who died in the immediate weeks after the battle and eventually 6,000 prisoners and 4,000 wounded. The Portuguese suffered some 700 killed and more than 2,000 wounded.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Montes Claros effectively ended major combat operations during the Restoration War and definitively secured Portuguese independence from Spain. The Spanish did not attempt another invasion; instead the defeat led to a treaty being signed between England and Spain at [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Madrid in 1667]]. As a result of this England mediated the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]] which was signed by Portugal and Spain a year later.

The Spanish crown was also facing financial difficulties, and there was a legitimate fear that the army would have to be disbanded for lack of funds if the war continued.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of War in the Iberian Peninsula|last=Tuell|first=Marcus|publisher=William & Wilkins Publishing House|year=1952|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=242\u2013244|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Portuguese were prepared and had foreseen such an attack. 3,500 men were moved from [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (region)|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]] in the north to [[Alentejo]] in the south. A further 7,800 men came from [[Lisbon]], under command of [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Meneses]], who had defeated the Spanish in the [[Battle of the Lines of Elvas]] six years earlier. They were reinforced by a veteran [[English expedition to Portugal (1662\u20131668)|English contingent]] of 2,000 men under the command of the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Duke of Schomberg]].\n\nA veteran commander who had been defending the Portuguese border with Spain for over 20 years, Meneses was aware that there were any number of ways for Carrillo to invade the country. As such, he reinforced the border garrisons of [[Elvas]] and [[Campo Maior, Portugal|Campo Maior]], hoping to harden the frontier defenses and in doing so influence the route Carrillo would take. Having been present during the Portuguese victory at Ameixial, Meneses was well aware that the Spanish faced logistical challenges when invading Portugal, and as such he planned to keep Carrillo's army trapped in the border hinterlands as long as possible to wear down their numbers. The Portuguese were also conscious of the failing health of the Spanish king, and Meneses suspected that this would force them to attack.<ref name=\"Tuell, 242\">Tuell, 242</ref>\n\nCarrillo's army moved into Portugal on 25 May. He first took [[Borba (Portugal)|Borba]] without resistance after it was abandoned by the Portuguese garrison. He then laid siege to [[Vila Vi\u00e7osa]], which was better defended and offered a stiff resistance to the Spanish attackers.\n\nThe Portuguese decided to exchange land for time, as it was hoped that the rough terrain of the hinterlands would degrade Carrillo's army. Despite this strategy, Meneses was determined to engage the Spanish army on a battlefield of his choosing. The main body of the Portuguese army set itself in motion towards the Spanish force surrounding Vila Vi\u00e7osa, but it stopped in [[Montes Claros (Portugal)|Montes Claros]], halfway between Vila Vi\u00e7osa and [[Estremoz]].<ref name=\"Tuell, 242\"/><ref name=\":1\">White, L.

By June, attacks by Portuguese militias were taking a heavy toll on his lines of supply, Vila Vicosa continued to put up an unexpectedly fierce defense, and the Spanish court was demanding action. In spite of these setbacks, Carrillo continued to rely on his previous plans for the capture of Lisbon. However, when informed that Meneses's numerically inferior force was advancing on him from Estremoz, Carrillo decided to engage the Portuguese.\n\n==Battle==\nMeneses deployed his army in a defensive formation adjacent to and at the southern end of a long ridge. A dense forest and hills lay further to the south of the Portuguese positions. By defending the space between these two terrain features, Meneses planned to limit the number of Portuguese and Spanish soldiers fighting at any one time and as such counter the superior Spanish numbers. He positioned his heaviest infantry, composed of seasoned veterans, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries under the command of Frederic Schomberg in two lines in this gap and positioned his artillery to support them. The rest of the Portuguese army was held in reserve and ordered to prevent the Spanish from scaling the ridge line. Carrillo was well aware of the Portuguese defenses and massed his cavalry and artillery for an all out attack on the gap between the ridge and the forest.<ref name=\":0\">Tuell, 243-44</ref>\n\n[[File:Batalha de Montes Claros, tamb\u00e9m chamada de Vila Vi\u00e7osa (1668) - Gaspar Bouttats.png|thumb|Contemporary engraving of the battle]]\nThe battle opened with the Spanish artillery firing into the Portuguese positions, opening gaps in the first line of infantry. The Spanish cavalry then charged the Portuguese lines and overran several units. The Portuguese infantry organized themselves into squares to fend off the cavalry, but this left them vulnerable to the Spanish artillery. The Duke of Schomberg's men gathered around some buildings on the left flank of the Portuguese army, using the structures and a vineyard wall to break up the advancing mass of Spanish cavalry.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Portuguese cannon fired repeatedly into the ranks of Spanish cavalry, inflicting many casualties. As the first Spanish charge retreated, Meneses ordered his first line back and consolidated it into the second line.

The battle raged on and the fighting was extremely intense. The Duke of Schomberg had his horse shot from underneath him and was almost captured by the Spanish. The Portuguese artillery in particular was devastating as shot after shot was fired into the advancing mass of Spaniards, while the Spanish cannon were soon forced to cease in their firing for fear of hitting their own men. The assault collapsed, and Spanish infantry and cavalrymen were soon pressed tightly together, becoming easy targets for the Portuguese. The Spanish cavalry alone suffered over 1,200 casualties in the third charge against the Portuguese line.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=The History of Portugal - From the Reign of D.

It dissipates the proton gradient across [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]] membranes, collapsing the [[proton motive force]] that the cell uses to produce most of its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat.<ref name=\"3550200Tab1\" />\n\nDNP is often used in [[biochemistry]] research to help explore the [[bioenergetics]] of [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] and other [[membrane transport]] processes.\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nDNP acts as a [[protonophore]], allowing protons to leak across the inner [[mitochondrial membrane]] and thus bypass [[ATP synthase]]. This makes ATP energy production less efficient. In effect, part of the energy that is normally produced from cellular respiration is wasted as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for [[uncoupler|uncoupling]] [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The \"[[phosphorylation]]\" of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or \"uncoupled\" from oxidation.\n\n\"Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake. This leads to free intracellular calcium and causes muscle contraction and hyperthermia. [[Dantrolene]] inhibits calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which reduces intracellular calcium. The resulting muscle relaxation allows heat dissipation. There is little risk to dantrolene administration. Since dantrolene may be effective in reducing hyperthermia caused by agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, early administration may improve outcome.\"<ref name=\"pmid16749560\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker K, Seger D, Kumar S|year=2006|title=Comment on \"Pediatric fatality following ingestion of Dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a 'dietary supplement'\"|journal=Clin Toxicol|volume=44|issue=3|pages=351|doi=10.1080/15563650600584709|pmid=16749560}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nInformation about [[pharmacokinetics]] of DNP in humans is limited.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | title = Ambient water quality criteria for nitrophenols, 440/5-80-063 | url = http://www.epa.gov/ost/pc/ambientwqc/nitrophenols80.pdf | year = 1980| accessdate= 9 June 2008 }}</ref> The [[ATSDR]]'s Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols remarks that DNP elimination appears to be rapid except when liver function is impaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=729&tid=132|title=Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols|author1=Harris, M.

It dissipates the proton gradient across [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]] membranes, collapsing the [[proton motive force]] that the cell uses to produce most of its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat.<ref name=\"3550200Tab1\" />\n\nDNP is often used in [[biochemistry]] research to help explore the [[bioenergetics]] of [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] and other [[membrane transport]] processes.\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nDNP acts as a [[protonophore]], allowing protons to leak across the inner [[mitochondrial membrane]] and thus bypass [[ATP synthase]]. This makes ATP energy production less efficient. In effect, part of the energy that is normally produced from cellular respiration is wasted as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for [[uncoupler|uncoupling]] [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The \"[[phosphorylation]]\" of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or \"uncoupled\" from oxidation.\n\n\"Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake. This leads to free intracellular calcium and causes muscle contraction and hyperthermia. [[Dantrolene]] inhibits calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which reduces intracellular calcium. The resulting muscle relaxation allows heat dissipation. There is little risk to dantrolene administration. Since dantrolene may be effective in reducing hyperthermia caused by agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, early administration may improve outcome.\"<ref name=\"pmid16749560\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker K, Seger D, Kumar S|year=2006|title=Comment on \"Pediatric fatality following ingestion of Dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a 'dietary supplement'\"|journal=Clin Toxicol|volume=44|issue=3|pages=351|doi=10.1080/15563650600584709|pmid=16749560}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nInformation about [[pharmacokinetics]] of DNP in humans is limited.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | title = Ambient water quality criteria for nitrophenols, 440/5-80-063 | url = http://www.epa.gov/ost/pc/ambientwqc/nitrophenols80.pdf | year = 1980| accessdate= 9 June 2008 }}</ref> The [[ATSDR]]'s Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols remarks that DNP elimination appears to be rapid except when liver function is impaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=729&tid=132|title=Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols|author1=Harris, M.

Rooke's squadron was protecting '''the Smyrna convoy''', and it is by this name that the action is sometimes known.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn the spring of 1693, a large convoy was organized to transport English and Dutch merchant ships which were bound for Spain and the [[Mediterranean]]; they had been held back by the threat of attack by the French fleet, or by commerce raiders.\n\nThe convoy, consisting of upwards of 200 sail, was to be escorted by a strong squadron of eight English and five Dutch ships of the line, with fireships, scouts and other auxiliaries, under the command of Admiral George Rooke. This squadron was bound for the Mediterranean, to take up station there. The convoy was to be covered by the combined allied fleet for its passage across the Channel, until it was past the port of Brest, to guard against attack by the French stationed there. The fleet, which was also charged with protecting England from the threat of invasion, would then double back to cover the Channel.\n\nThe French, however, whilst they had  made good their losses of the previous year, had abandoned the intent to invade in favour of a ''[[Commerce raiding|guerre de course]]'', a war against the allies' trade and commercial interests.<ref>*[[A.T. Mahan]] : The Influence of Sea-Power upon History 1660-1805. {{ISBN|0-600-34162-3}}.</ref>\n\nTo this end, [[Louis XIV]] had dispatched the French fleet under Tourville, his most able commander, to set an ambush for the convoy before it entered the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]. By the end of May, Tourville had assembled a fleet of 70 ships of the line, plus fireships, stores vessels and other auxiliaries, about 100 sail in total; and taken up station near [[Lagos Bay]] in Portugal.\n\nThe convoy sailed at the end of May, with the allied fleet of 24 Dutch warships under [[Philips van Almonde]] and 45 English under a leadership committee of Admirals [[Henry Killigrew (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Killigrew]], [[Ralph Delaval]] and [[Cloudesley Shovell]].\n\nBy 7 June (O.S) the convoy was about 150 miles southwest of [[Ushant]], and the main allied fleet had turned back, leaving Rooke and the convoy to proceed south.\nThe allies had made no move to check where the French fleet was, and received no news of its whereabouts until 17 June (O.S). By this time Rooke and the convoy were in action off Lagos, having been sighted by the French on the morning of 17 June (O.S).\n\n==The battle==\nRooke could not avoid battle, but held the advantage of being to windward. Ordering the merchant ships to disperse, his squadron took up battle positions. The battle started around 8 pm. when the rear of his squadron was overtaken by the French van (Gabaret).<br> Two Dutch ships, ''Zeeland'' (64, Philip Schrijver) and ''Wapen van Medemblik'' (64, Jan van der Poel), engaged the French, thus sacrificing themselves. They fought valiantly, giving the rest of the allied ships time enough to escape.\nWhen the two Dutch ships finally surrendered, Tourville was very impressed and congratulated the two captains, asking them if they \"were men or devils\".<br>Rooke declared it \"one of the best judged things I ever saw in action\".<ref>*[[N. A. M. Rodger]]: ''The Command of The Ocean''. (2004) {{ISBN|0-7139-9411-8}} .</ref>\n\nThe next day Rooke, with 54 merchant ships in company, was standing west. In pursuit were just four French warships. As they closed, Rooke's flagship, the ''Royal Oak'' (100) guns, turned to face them. After a short exchange they abandoned the chase and drew off. Rooke and his group were able to reach [[Madeira]] without further incident, where he found ''Monk'' (60) with one of the Dutch warships, and 40 or 50 merchant ships in company. With this party and stragglers collected en route, Rooke was able to reach Ireland on 30 July.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOver half of the convoy was saved. Some 90 ships were lost, the majority were Dutch and 40 were captured by the French. The two main goals of the convoy: first, to deliver the traders to their destinations in the Mediterranean and second, to establish a naval presence there, were defeated.

Rooke's squadron was protecting '''the Smyrna convoy''', and it is by this name that the action is sometimes known.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn the spring of 1693, a large convoy was organized to transport English and Dutch merchant ships which were bound for Spain and the [[Mediterranean]]; they had been held back by the threat of attack by the French fleet, or by commerce raiders.\n\nThe convoy, consisting of upwards of 200 sail, was to be escorted by a strong squadron of eight English and five Dutch ships of the line, with fireships, scouts and other auxiliaries, under the command of Admiral George Rooke. This squadron was bound for the Mediterranean, to take up station there. The convoy was to be covered by the combined allied fleet for its passage across the Channel, until it was past the port of Brest, to guard against attack by the French stationed there. The fleet, which was also charged with protecting England from the threat of invasion, would then double back to cover the Channel.\n\nThe French, however, whilst they had  made good their losses of the previous year, had abandoned the intent to invade in favour of a ''[[Commerce raiding|guerre de course]]'', a war against the allies' trade and commercial interests.<ref>*[[A.T. Mahan]] : The Influence of Sea-Power upon History 1660-1805. {{ISBN|0-600-34162-3}}.</ref>\n\nTo this end, [[Louis XIV]] had dispatched the French fleet under Tourville, his most able commander, to set an ambush for the convoy before it entered the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]. By the end of May, Tourville had assembled a fleet of 70 ships of the line, plus fireships, stores vessels and other auxiliaries, about 100 sail in total; and taken up station near [[Lagos Bay]] in Portugal.\n\nThe convoy sailed at the end of May, with the allied fleet of 24 Dutch warships under [[Philips van Almonde]] and 45 English under a leadership committee of Admirals [[Henry Killigrew (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Killigrew]], [[Ralph Delaval]] and [[Cloudesley Shovell]].\n\nBy 7 June (O.S) the convoy was about 150 miles southwest of [[Ushant]], and the main allied fleet had turned back, leaving Rooke and the convoy to proceed south.\nThe allies had made no move to check where the French fleet was, and received no news of its whereabouts until 17 June (O.S). By this time Rooke and the convoy were in action off Lagos, having been sighted by the French on the morning of 17 June (O.S).\n\n==The battle==\nRooke could not avoid battle, but held the advantage of being to windward. Ordering the merchant ships to disperse, his squadron took up battle positions. The battle started around 8 pm. when the rear of his squadron was overtaken by the French van (Gabaret).<br> Two Dutch ships, ''Zeeland'' (64, Philip Schrijver) and ''Wapen van Medemblik'' (64, Jan van der Poel), engaged the French, thus sacrificing themselves. They fought valiantly, giving the rest of the allied ships time enough to escape.\nWhen the two Dutch ships finally surrendered, Tourville was very impressed and congratulated the two captains, asking them if they \"were men or devils\".<br>Rooke declared it \"one of the best judged things I ever saw in action\".<ref>*[[N. A. M. Rodger]]: ''The Command of The Ocean''. (2004) {{ISBN|0-7139-9411-8}} .</ref>\n\nThe next day Rooke, with 54 merchant ships in company, was standing west. In pursuit were just four French warships. As they closed, Rooke's flagship, the ''Royal Oak'' (100) guns, turned to face them. After a short exchange they abandoned the chase and drew off. Rooke and his group were able to reach [[Madeira]] without further incident, where he found ''Monk'' (60) with one of the Dutch warships, and 40 or 50 merchant ships in company. With this party and stragglers collected en route, Rooke was able to reach Ireland on 30 July.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOver half of the convoy was saved. Some 90 ships were lost, the majority were Dutch and 40 were captured by the French. The two main goals of the convoy: first, to deliver the traders to their destinations in the Mediterranean and second, to establish a naval presence there, were defeated. For the French there was a huge gain, with prizes valued at 30 million livres. The [[City of London]] judged it the worst financial disaster since the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]], 27 years previously.<ref>*Aubrey P: The Defeat of James Stuart's Armada 1692(1979). {{ISBN|0-7185-1168-9}} .</ref>\n\nFor Tourville it was worthy revenge for his defeat in the [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of La Hogue]] one year earlier.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Flag |volume=10 |pages=454\u2013463 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite AmCyc |title=Flag |volume=8 |page=250  |url=https://archive.org/stream/americancyclopae07ripluoft#page/249/mode/1up |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |ref={{harvid|Vinkhuijzen collection|2011}} |origyear=2004 |date=25 March 2011 |url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgdisplaylargemeta.cfm?strucID=585779&imageID=1236061&parent_id=585395&word=&s=&notword=&d=&c=&f=&sScope=&sLevel=&sLabel=&lword=&lfield=&num=0&imgs=12&total=98&pos=1&snum= |title= The Vinkhuijzen collection of military uniforms: France, 1750-1757 |publisher=New York Public Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406164952/http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?strucID=585779&imageID=1236061&parent_id=585395&word=&s=&notword=&d=&c=&f=&sScope=&sLevel=&sLabel=&lword=&lfield=&num=0&total=98&pos=1&snum=&e=w |archivedate=8 March 2013}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marine.nl/historie/marinemuseum/Webspecials/Heldendaden/Negenjarigeoorlog/Lagos/   Zeegevecht bij Lagos (Dutch)]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{coord|37.0000|N|8.6667|W|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lagos 1693, Battle Of}}\n[[Category:1693 in France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the Dutch Republic]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving England]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Nine Years' War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1693]]\n[[Category:1693 in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Lagos, Portugal]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos_(1693)"}
