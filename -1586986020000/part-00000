The role was introduced by the show's then head writers [[Dena Higley]] and Christopher Whitesell on November 20, 2009. The role was initially portrayed by Gabriela Rodriguez, however, several months later producers made  the decision to age Gabi. In July 2010, it was announced that Rodriguez was replaced by Camila Banus. Banus first aired on October 4, 2010.\n\nOriginally described as a sweet, innocent, and loving girl, a number of events since Gabi's arrival on the series have altered her personality. In 2012, the character experienced a personality shift, which would reveal her manipulative side that was called \"crazy\" and obsessive. Her storylines have included the death of her sister [[Arianna Hernandez]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]), her first love (Will) coming to terms that he is gay, and romances with [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Casey Deidrick|Casey Jon Deidrick]], [[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]), [[Nick Fallon]] ([[Blake Berris]]), [[JJ Deveraux]] ([[Casey Moss]]) [[Eli Grant]] ([[Lamon Archey]]) [[Stefan DiMera]] ([[Brandon Barash]]) . Gabi is of Latin descent, and Banus has expressed her pride to represent the Hispanic community through her portrayal. Banus' portrayal of Gabi earned her a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2015.\n\n== Casting ==\nGabriela Rodriguez first appeared in the role of Gabi on November 20, 2009.<ref name=\"SC\" /> Of auditioning, Rodriguez said \"It was honestly so random. I had never auditioned for a soap opera before and I was like \"wow this is different. I think I want to give it a try.\" She seemed like such a cool girl, I was like \"hey let's go for it.\" [...] I ended up talking with the casting director for a while and she just kind of explained to me about the character [...] The next day I got called for a callback and that was that.\"<ref name=\"Rod\">{{cite web|last=Nobles|first=Omar|title=Getting To Know Gabriela Rodriguez|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/interviews/television/1920-getting-to-know-gabriela-rodriguez|work=TVSource Magazine|publisher=SoSource Media|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=June 25, 2010}}</ref> Fellow Hispanic actress Camilla Banus had also auditioned. Banus stated \"I went in and read for the role. It was actually a pretty long process. The first audition then the second audition, then I went in again to meet the casting director and the producer.

This made Will admit to being the father of Gabi's baby. She and Nick get married in March 2013.  Nick blackmailed Will into giving up his parental rights.  She gave birth to her daughter, Arianna Grace Horton in May 2013 and Nick\u2014after Will saved his life\u2014allowed Will to be her father.  When he revealed to Gabi about his blackmailing Will and not wanting him in her or the baby\u2019s life because Will was gay, she sought an annulment.\n\nWhen Nick plots to remove Will from Arianna's life and become her primary guardian, Gabi and Nick have a physical altercation in which Gabi strikes him with a rock to keep him from raping her, \"killing\" him (or so she believes). Sami and Kate help Gabi dump him in the river in which he wakes up before believing he drowned. However, he returns continues to blackmail Gabi until the character was killed in a [[whodunit]] murder mystery.\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===2009\u20132014===\nGabriella Josephina Hernandez is born in 1992 or 1993 in Salem, Illinois.<ref>Arianna Horton's birth certificate list Gabi's full name, Gabriella Josephina Hernandez, age, 20, and apparently place of birth as Salem. June 5, 2013.</ref><ref>Camila Banus listed Gabi's name as Gabriela Josefina Hernandez on Twitter. June 26, 2013.</ref>  She is the younger sister of Rafe, the late Arianna, and Dario Hernandez. Rafe and Arianna felt that they were being stalked while at the Brady pub, but were shocked to find out that Gabi had come to Salem and was spying on them. Initially for her winter break, Gabi decided to permanently move to Salem, and moved into a vacant room at the Brady Pub. Arianna and Gabi briefly argued but eventually bonded. She befriended other local teens including Chad Peterson-Woods (later revealed to be Chad DiMera). They briefly dated, but he left her for Mia. Saddened by the break-up, Gabi focused herself fully on school. She befriended Will Horton who attended the Salem High formal as her date. Arianna was killed in a [[hit-and-run]] accident. She leaned on Will for support and they shared their first kiss. The couple's romance deepened as they were there for one another during mutual times of crisis. They slept together, but Gabi noticed that Will didn't want to sleep with her again. He later came out as gay, and they split up. Gabi earned a job at [[Quinn Hudson]]'s (Bren Foster) Intensity Day Spa and developed another crush on Chad, and began scheming to break him and his girlfriend [[Melanie Jonas]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) up. To make Chad worry over her, she pretended to have a stalker, writing fake threatening notes. Chad had Gabi move in with him. So further keep up with her lie, she hired a guy named Andrew to pose as her stalker. Eventually, Andrew's actions became too much and Gabi told him to stop. He ended up kidnapping Melanie, to Gabi's knowledge. Andrew blackmailed Gabi into not telling anybody about Melanie. The truth was eventually revealed, and Chad hated Gabi for it. Feeling down, she ended up having a [[one night stand]] with Will, but agreed that it was a mistake. Chad consistently reminded Gabi that she would continue to pay for what she did. She then began a relationship with Nick, who was released from jail after serving time because he kidnapped Melanie. Nick reassured everyone he was a changed man. Chad assaulted Nick, who promised not to press charges if Chad dropped his threats towards Gabi, which he did. Gabi and Nick began planning their happy future, but she realized that she was pregnant with Will's child. Eventually, Gabi, Nick and Will decided that they would pretend that Nick is the father, and Gabi and Nick decided to get married. But when Gabi accidentally let it slip that she is further along than she originally said, Nick covered for her, saying that the two had a one-night stand the day they met. Despite there being some anger at this, everyone has accepted the duo as a couple, except for Chad, who wants Gabi to pay for her misdeeds. Chad told [[Sonny Kiriakis]], Will's boyfriend, about Gabi's role in Melanie's kidnapping. Ever since, Sonny has cut all his ties to Gabi and warned Will to avoid her. On May 20, 2013, Gabi gave birth to a daughter, Arianna Grace Horton, after Gabi's sister and Rafe's deceased goddaughter. Nick finally tells Gabi about what happened to him in prison, and what he did to Will. Gabi moves in with Will, Sonny and baby Arianna and her marriage to Nick is annulled. Despite being divorced, Nick continued to be obsessed with Gabi. When Gabi refused his advances, he tried to rape her. Gabi took a rock and bashed Nick on the head. Sami and Kate arrived and help Gabi throw Nick's body in the water. Nick briefly woke up before sinking into the water, and Gabi was haunted by the fact that they had let him die. On the day of Arianna's christening, Nick showed up at the ceremony alive, and lied about the events that happened that night. Nick wanted to reconcile with Gabi and slowly spent time with her and Arianna. He tried to get Gabi to take Arianna away from Will, but was eventually shot and killed with Gabi revealed to be the shooter. Gabi explained that she was scared of Nick's influence over her and felt she had to kill him to stop him from being a threat to Arianna. She also admitted her role in Melanie's kidnapping and told Marlena about her, Kate and Sami throwing Nick in the river. EJ, who served as Gabi's lawyer, thought it would be better for her to have a plea deal than go to trial and have the truth about Melanie's kidnapping come out. Gabi accepted the plea deal and got ten to twenty years in prison.\n\nGabi is visited by Rafe and later on by Will, Sonny and Arianna for the holidays. She gets another visitor, but it's Melanie, instead of Will and Sonny, who forgave Gabi her past decisions.\n\n===2015\u2013present===\nGabi is released from prison in September 2015 and shares a happy reunion with Rafe, Will and Arianna thanks to an error made in her sentencing. As Gabi settles back into her life and relaunches her modeling career when Kate hires her at ''Basic Black'' working opposite retired baseball player [[Paul Narita]] ([[Christopher Sean]]), she is devastated when Will is murdered by a serial killer. The killings lead to Gabi's reunion with her estranged father Eduardo ([[A Martinez]]) for the first time since she was an infant as one of the serial killer victims is Gabi's half-sister [[Paige Larson|Paige]] ([[True O'Brien]]). In December 2015, Gabi bonds with [[JJ Deveraux]] ([[Casey Moss]]) and they begin dating, but the romance is short-lived and he had cheated on her with Abe's daughter, Lani.  In 2016, her best friend [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail Devereaux DiMera]] (JJ's sister) is presumed dead, and Gabi later begins a relationship with her husband Chad.  But in November 2016, Chad's wife Abigail returns to Salem and they reconcile, so Gabi tries to ignore her feelings for Chad.   \nChad and Gabi are locked in a meat locker by [[Deimos Kiriakis]] and Chad tells Gabi he loves her. Abigail, with the help of Gabi's brother Dario, who has developed feelings for Abigail himself, rescue them. Chad tells Abigail that he still has feelings for Gabi, but that he loves Abigail and wants to keep his marriage, and eventually decides he must remove Gabi from his life entirely. The day that Chad decides to tell Gabi this, Deimos kidnaps Abigail and Gabi and poisons them both and gives Chad only enough antidote to save one of the women, forcing him to choose which woman would live and which would die. Chad, however, gives half of the antidote to each one, saving both of their lives.\n\nWhen Gabi recovered from the poison, , Andre DiMera (Thaao Penghlis) warned her about coming in between Abigail and Chad. Gabi supported Chad and Abigail's plans to remarry, but Abigail broke it off with Chad. At the time, Gabi was dating Eli Grant (Lamon Archey). Gabi went to Greece where Chad and Eli both went for different reasons. Chad went to procure amulet that was said to be cursed and Eli went with Hope, Rafe, Lani, and JJ to capture Deimos. Eli saw Gabi has feelings for Chad and broke up with her. Deimos was successfully apprehended and Hope and Rafe brought him back to Salem. Gabi, Eli, JJ, Sonny, and Paul all went with Chad, but their plans crashed, stranding them on a desert island. Gabi realized Chad had the amulet with him him when he told her he had gotten rid of it, and convinced him to bury it in the sand. Gabi and Chad admitted they had feelings for each other and slept together. Paul ended up contracting jungle madness, and ended up attacking Gabi. They were rescued by John and Marlena and returned safely to town. Andre warned Gabi not to her Chad, and subtly threatened her by telling her to watch her back. Gabi and Chad continued seeing each other while Abigail got ready to marry Dario. Gabi supported the marriage, but Chad was skeptical of the rush to get married. Everything culminated with the death of Deimos, and Abigail\u2019s desire to protect Chad, which led to her getting struck by a car and the revelation that Abigai had only married Dario to stop deportation, which he lied about and then later blackmailed her to stay married to him. Gabi realized Chad still loved Abigail and broke up with him.\n\nGabi stumbled upon evidence that Dario had sent to implicate Commissioner Lou Raines (Aaron D. Spears) as his partner. Raines finds out and held Gabi hostage. Eli saved Gabi by shooting Raines in the shoulder, and he was apprehended. Gabi and Eli reconnected as he taught her self defense, and eventually rekindled their romance. After JJ accidentally shot Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis), he struggled with the guilt and planned to commit suicide. Gabi found out and was furious with JJ. Concerned, Gabi stayed overnight to make sure JJ was alright. Gabi went to work for DiMera after signing a contract that had GabiChic work under them. Chad and Andre\u2019s long lost brother Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash) came to town and took over DiMera. Stefan subtly flirted with Gabi, though he was interested in Abigail. Gabi was shocked and angry when Andre severed their contract with Gabi, and used a loophole to steal GabiChic from her. Gabi was furious with Andre and vowed to make him pay. The next morning, Andre was found dead on the floor of the office with blood leaking from a head wound, and the murder weapon, the furnace that contained the ashes of Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis), lay on the floor underneath his desk with the lid missing and the ashes scattered across the floor. Security footage showed a woman that resembled Gabi leaving the office with the lid, but Gabi swore she didn\u2019t kill Andre.\n\nGabi found out that Eli and Lani had slept together and surmised that he was the father of Lani\u2019s baby, so she broke up with him. The missing lid showed up in Gabi\u2019s purse and she attempted to get rid of it, but Lani caught her and arrested her. Chad and Abigail wee convinced that Stefan had hired someone to pose as Gabi and kill Andre. Chad vowed to find the woman, but ultimately failed. At Gabi\u2019s trial, Abigail claimed that Gabi confessed to her that she killed Andre. Gabi was found guilty and sent to prison where she was left bitter and angry that Abigail would betray her like that. Gabi was attacked in prison by a woman named Diane, who had been Raines\u2019 girlfriend and blamed her for Raines arrest. Gabi was beaten nearly to death and hospitalized. Diane attempted to finish the neck and wound up dead with a needle in her neck. Abigail finally remembered that she had killed Andre, and soon after developed DID. It was her altar, Gabby, that left the office with the lid, and her other altar, Dr. Laura, that had lied about Gabi killing Andre. Abigail confessed and attempted to apologize to Gabi, but she was furious with Abigail and her release was delayed while they investigated Diane\u2019s murder. Gabi was released when someone else bragged about killing Diane.\n\nUpon her release, Gabi found out she suffered internal injuries from her attack that made it hard for her to have children. Gabi found out Chad was the father of Abigail\u2019s baby when Kayla Brady (Mary Beth Evans) left the paternity results on her desk, so Gabi burned the paternity test and forged a new one that said Stefan was the father. Abigail planned to get abortion, so Gabi, preying on hers and Abigail's friendship went to Stefan and told him Abigail was pregnant and that he was the father. Stefan stopped Abigail from having an abortion. Later on, Gabi went to Kayla and asked for some sleeping medication that was pregnancy safe. She drugged Abigail with the medications and send a message to Stefan from her phone, so to make him believe it was from Abigail\u2019s altar, Gabby, whom Stefan had fallen for. Kate found out about Gabi\u2019s plot, and Gabi convinced her to keep quiet, eventually resorting to blackmail once Kate got in too deep and expressed reservations. Gabi\u2019s plan started to work perfectly as Chad, JJ, and Jennifer all feared Abigail was relapsing. With Kate to back her up, whom Chad trusted, it was easy to convince him. Chad left Abigail and moved into the Kiriakis mansion where Gabi was already living, and she bonded with him as her plan as to have Abigail committed and raise her children with Chad. Abigail was the only one who was suspicious of Gabi.\n\nGabi upped the ante by dressing Abigail as Gabby and putting her in the DiMera mansion. She then whacked herself in the head with a tray and claimed Gabby had attacked her and Kate supported her story. As Chad planned to have Abigail committed, Abigail got a quick divorce from Chad and married Stefan. Luckily for Gabi, Chad was persistent and managed to get Stefan to commit Abigail. Gabi visited Abigail and gloated to Abigail, confessing everything. Abigail attacked Gabi and Chad ran in and broke them up. Abigail had no proof, so Chad continued to fall for Gabi\u2019s lies. Kate convinced Gabi to tell Chad the truth about his child, so Gabi printed a new copy from Kayla\u2019s computer and planned to make it look like Stefan had switched the results, but Stefan almost caught her and she was unable to plant the results in the mansion. Later, by Abigail's request to expose Gabi for her lies, Julie sneaked into the Kiriakis mansion and discovered the test results in Gabi's room. Gabi caught Julie with the evidence, who threatened to tell Chad everything. The two fought and Julie fell down the stairs. Julie was rushed to the hospital shortly after Chad and Sonny came to her aid. Desperate to keep Julie quiet, Gabi sneaked into Julie's room later that night in an attempt to suffocate her with a pillow, but was eventually caught by Abigail who accused her of pushing her down the stairs. Gabi continues to taunt Abigail's illness and gloats innocence... until Julie woke up and eventually told Abigail the truth, who then told Chad. A furious Chad threatened to send Gabi to prison, vowing to separate her from her only daughter the same way she separated Abigail from hers and her son. Abigail however chose not to press charges against Gabi, despite Chad's objection; but she also chose to permanently end her friendship with Gabi and wished her the best as they went on their separate ways.\n\n== Reception ==\nJanet Di Lauro of [[About.com]] said that the character is crazy and \"naughty.\"<ref name=\"BI\" /> Of being the only [[Hispanic]] during her time on ''Days of Our Lives'', Banus stated in 2012: \"I\u2019m definitely grateful.

The role was introduced by the show's then head writers [[Dena Higley]] and Christopher Whitesell on November 20, 2009. The role was initially portrayed by Gabriela Rodriguez, however, several months later producers made  the decision to age Gabi. In July 2010, it was announced that Rodriguez was replaced by Camila Banus. Banus first aired on October 4, 2010.\n\nOriginally described as a sweet, innocent, and loving girl, a number of events since Gabi's arrival on the series have altered her personality. In 2012, the character experienced a personality shift, which would reveal her manipulative side that was called \"crazy\" and obsessive. Her storylines have included the death of her sister [[Arianna Hernandez]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]), her first love (Will) coming to terms that he is gay, and romances with [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Casey Deidrick|Casey Jon Deidrick]], [[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]), [[Nick Fallon]] ([[Blake Berris]]), [[JJ Deveraux]] ([[Casey Moss]]) [[Eli Grant]] ([[Lamon Archey]]) [[Stefan DiMera]] ([[Brandon Barash]]) . Gabi is of Latin descent, and Banus has expressed her pride to represent the Hispanic community through her portrayal. Banus' portrayal of Gabi earned her a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2015.\n\n== Casting ==\nGabriela Rodriguez first appeared in the role of Gabi on November 20, 2009.<ref name=\"SC\" /> Of auditioning, Rodriguez said \"It was honestly so random.

This made Will admit to being the father of Gabi's baby. She and Nick get married in March 2013.  Nick blackmailed Will into giving up his parental rights.  She gave birth to her daughter, Arianna Grace Horton in May 2013 and Nick\u2014after Will saved his life\u2014allowed Will to be her father.  When he revealed to Gabi about his blackmailing Will and not wanting him in her or the baby\u2019s life because Will was gay, she sought an annulment.\n\nWhen Nick plots to remove Will from Arianna's life and become her primary guardian, Gabi and Nick have a physical altercation in which Gabi strikes him with a rock to keep him from raping her, \"killing\" him (or so she believes).

However, he returns continues to blackmail Gabi until the character was killed in a [[whodunit]] murder mystery.\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===2009\u20132014===\nGabriella Josephina Hernandez is born in 1992 or 1993 in Salem, Illinois.<ref>Arianna Horton's birth certificate list Gabi's full name, Gabriella Josephina Hernandez, age, 20, and apparently place of birth as Salem. June 5, 2013.</ref><ref>Camila Banus listed Gabi's name as Gabriela Josefina Hernandez on Twitter. June 26, 2013.</ref>  She is the younger sister of Rafe, the late Arianna, and Dario Hernandez. Rafe and Arianna felt that they were being stalked while at the Brady pub, but were shocked to find out that Gabi had come to Salem and was spying on them. Initially for her winter break, Gabi decided to permanently move to Salem, and moved into a vacant room at the Brady Pub. Arianna and Gabi briefly argued but eventually bonded. She befriended other local teens including Chad Peterson-Woods (later revealed to be Chad DiMera). They briefly dated, but he left her for Mia. Saddened by the break-up, Gabi focused herself fully on school. She befriended Will Horton who attended the Salem High formal as her date. Arianna was killed in a [[hit-and-run]] accident. She leaned on Will for support and they shared their first kiss. The couple's romance deepened as they were there for one another during mutual times of crisis. They slept together, but Gabi noticed that Will didn't want to sleep with her again. He later came out as gay, and they split up. Gabi earned a job at [[Quinn Hudson]]'s (Bren Foster) Intensity Day Spa and developed another crush on Chad, and began scheming to break him and his girlfriend [[Melanie Jonas]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) up. To make Chad worry over her, she pretended to have a stalker, writing fake threatening notes. Chad had Gabi move in with him. So further keep up with her lie, she hired a guy named Andrew to pose as her stalker. Eventually, Andrew's actions became too much and Gabi told him to stop. He ended up kidnapping Melanie, to Gabi's knowledge. Andrew blackmailed Gabi into not telling anybody about Melanie. The truth was eventually revealed, and Chad hated Gabi for it. Feeling down, she ended up having a [[one night stand]] with Will, but agreed that it was a mistake. Chad consistently reminded Gabi that she would continue to pay for what she did. She then began a relationship with Nick, who was released from jail after serving time because he kidnapped Melanie. Nick reassured everyone he was a changed man. Chad assaulted Nick, who promised not to press charges if Chad dropped his threats towards Gabi, which he did. Gabi and Nick began planning their happy future, but she realized that she was pregnant with Will's child. Eventually, Gabi, Nick and Will decided that they would pretend that Nick is the father, and Gabi and Nick decided to get married. But when Gabi accidentally let it slip that she is further along than she originally said, Nick covered for her, saying that the two had a one-night stand the day they met. Despite there being some anger at this, everyone has accepted the duo as a couple, except for Chad, who wants Gabi to pay for her misdeeds. Chad told [[Sonny Kiriakis]], Will's boyfriend, about Gabi's role in Melanie's kidnapping. Ever since, Sonny has cut all his ties to Gabi and warned Will to avoid her. On May 20, 2013, Gabi gave birth to a daughter, Arianna Grace Horton, after Gabi's sister and Rafe's deceased goddaughter. Nick finally tells Gabi about what happened to him in prison, and what he did to Will. Gabi moves in with Will, Sonny and baby Arianna and her marriage to Nick is annulled. Despite being divorced, Nick continued to be obsessed with Gabi. When Gabi refused his advances, he tried to rape her. Gabi took a rock and bashed Nick on the head. Sami and Kate arrived and help Gabi throw Nick's body in the water. Nick briefly woke up before sinking into the water, and Gabi was haunted by the fact that they had let him die. On the day of Arianna's christening, Nick showed up at the ceremony alive, and lied about the events that happened that night. Nick wanted to reconcile with Gabi and slowly spent time with her and Arianna. He tried to get Gabi to take Arianna away from Will, but was eventually shot and killed with Gabi revealed to be the shooter. Gabi explained that she was scared of Nick's influence over her and felt she had to kill him to stop him from being a threat to Arianna. She also admitted her role in Melanie's kidnapping and told Marlena about her, Kate and Sami throwing Nick in the river. EJ, who served as Gabi's lawyer, thought it would be better for her to have a plea deal than go to trial and have the truth about Melanie's kidnapping come out. Gabi accepted the plea deal and got ten to twenty years in prison.\n\nGabi is visited by Rafe and later on by Will, Sonny and Arianna for the holidays. She gets another visitor, but it's Melanie, instead of Will and Sonny, who forgave Gabi her past decisions.\n\n===2015\u2013present===\nGabi is released from prison in September 2015 and shares a happy reunion with Rafe, Will and Arianna thanks to an error made in her sentencing. As Gabi settles back into her life and relaunches her modeling career when Kate hires her at ''Basic Black'' working opposite retired baseball player [[Paul Narita]] ([[Christopher Sean]]), she is devastated when Will is murdered by a serial killer. The killings lead to Gabi's reunion with her estranged father Eduardo ([[A Martinez]]) for the first time since she was an infant as one of the serial killer victims is Gabi's half-sister [[Paige Larson|Paige]] ([[True O'Brien]]). In December 2015, Gabi bonds with [[JJ Deveraux]] ([[Casey Moss]]) and they begin dating, but the romance is short-lived and he had cheated on her with Abe's daughter, Lani.  In 2016, her best friend [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail Devereaux DiMera]] (JJ's sister) is presumed dead, and Gabi later begins a relationship with her husband Chad.  But in November 2016, Chad's wife Abigail returns to Salem and they reconcile, so Gabi tries to ignore her feelings for Chad.   \nChad and Gabi are locked in a meat locker by [[Deimos Kiriakis]] and Chad tells Gabi he loves her. Abigail, with the help of Gabi's brother Dario, who has developed feelings for Abigail himself, rescue them. Chad tells Abigail that he still has feelings for Gabi, but that he loves Abigail and wants to keep his marriage, and eventually decides he must remove Gabi from his life entirely. The day that Chad decides to tell Gabi this, Deimos kidnaps Abigail and Gabi and poisons them both and gives Chad only enough antidote to save one of the women, forcing him to choose which woman would live and which would die. Chad, however, gives half of the antidote to each one, saving both of their lives.\n\nWhen Gabi recovered from the poison, , Andre DiMera (Thaao Penghlis) warned her about coming in between Abigail and Chad. Gabi supported Chad and Abigail's plans to remarry, but Abigail broke it off with Chad. At the time, Gabi was dating Eli Grant (Lamon Archey). Gabi went to Greece where Chad and Eli both went for different reasons. Chad went to procure amulet that was said to be cursed and Eli went with Hope, Rafe, Lani, and JJ to capture Deimos. Eli saw Gabi has feelings for Chad and broke up with her. Deimos was successfully apprehended and Hope and Rafe brought him back to Salem. Gabi, Eli, JJ, Sonny, and Paul all went with Chad, but their plans crashed, stranding them on a desert island. Gabi realized Chad had the amulet with him him when he told her he had gotten rid of it, and convinced him to bury it in the sand. Gabi and Chad admitted they had feelings for each other and slept together. Paul ended up contracting jungle madness, and ended up attacking Gabi. They were rescued by John and Marlena and returned safely to town. Andre warned Gabi not to her Chad, and subtly threatened her by telling her to watch her back. Gabi and Chad continued seeing each other while Abigail got ready to marry Dario. Gabi supported the marriage, but Chad was skeptical of the rush to get married. Everything culminated with the death of Deimos, and Abigail\u2019s desire to protect Chad, which led to her getting struck by a car and the revelation that Abigai had only married Dario to stop deportation, which he lied about and then later blackmailed her to stay married to him. Gabi realized Chad still loved Abigail and broke up with him.\n\nGabi stumbled upon evidence that Dario had sent to implicate Commissioner Lou Raines (Aaron D. Spears) as his partner. Raines finds out and held Gabi hostage. Eli saved Gabi by shooting Raines in the shoulder, and he was apprehended. Gabi and Eli reconnected as he taught her self defense, and eventually rekindled their romance. After JJ accidentally shot Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis), he struggled with the guilt and planned to commit suicide. Gabi found out and was furious with JJ. Concerned, Gabi stayed overnight to make sure JJ was alright. Gabi went to work for DiMera after signing a contract that had GabiChic work under them. Chad and Andre\u2019s long lost brother Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash) came to town and took over DiMera. Stefan subtly flirted with Gabi, though he was interested in Abigail. Gabi was shocked and angry when Andre severed their contract with Gabi, and used a loophole to steal GabiChic from her. Gabi was furious with Andre and vowed to make him pay. The next morning, Andre was found dead on the floor of the office with blood leaking from a head wound, and the murder weapon, the furnace that contained the ashes of Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis), lay on the floor underneath his desk with the lid missing and the ashes scattered across the floor. Security footage showed a woman that resembled Gabi leaving the office with the lid, but Gabi swore she didn\u2019t kill Andre.\n\nGabi found out that Eli and Lani had slept together and surmised that he was the father of Lani\u2019s baby, so she broke up with him. The missing lid showed up in Gabi\u2019s purse and she attempted to get rid of it, but Lani caught her and arrested her. Chad and Abigail wee convinced that Stefan had hired someone to pose as Gabi and kill Andre. Chad vowed to find the woman, but ultimately failed. At Gabi\u2019s trial, Abigail claimed that Gabi confessed to her that she killed Andre. Gabi was found guilty and sent to prison where she was left bitter and angry that Abigail would betray her like that. Gabi was attacked in prison by a woman named Diane, who had been Raines\u2019 girlfriend and blamed her for Raines arrest. Gabi was beaten nearly to death and hospitalized. Diane attempted to finish the neck and wound up dead with a needle in her neck. Abigail finally remembered that she had killed Andre, and soon after developed DID. It was her altar, Gabby, that left the office with the lid, and her other altar, Dr. Laura, that had lied about Gabi killing Andre. Abigail confessed and attempted to apologize to Gabi, but she was furious with Abigail and her release was delayed while they investigated Diane\u2019s murder. Gabi was released when someone else bragged about killing Diane.\n\nUpon her release, Gabi found out she suffered internal injuries from her attack that made it hard for her to have children. Gabi found out Chad was the father of Abigail\u2019s baby when Kayla Brady (Mary Beth Evans) left the paternity results on her desk, so Gabi burned the paternity test and forged a new one that said Stefan was the father. Abigail planned to get abortion, so Gabi, preying on hers and Abigail's friendship went to Stefan and told him Abigail was pregnant and that he was the father. Stefan stopped Abigail from having an abortion. Later on, Gabi went to Kayla and asked for some sleeping medication that was pregnancy safe. She drugged Abigail with the medications and send a message to Stefan from her phone, so to make him believe it was from Abigail\u2019s altar, Gabby, whom Stefan had fallen for. Kate found out about Gabi\u2019s plot, and Gabi convinced her to keep quiet, eventually resorting to blackmail once Kate got in too deep and expressed reservations. Gabi\u2019s plan started to work perfectly as Chad, JJ, and Jennifer all feared Abigail was relapsing. With Kate to back her up, whom Chad trusted, it was easy to convince him. Chad left Abigail and moved into the Kiriakis mansion where Gabi was already living, and she bonded with him as her plan as to have Abigail committed and raise her children with Chad. Abigail was the only one who was suspicious of Gabi.\n\nGabi upped the ante by dressing Abigail as Gabby and putting her in the DiMera mansion. She then whacked herself in the head with a tray and claimed Gabby had attacked her and Kate supported her story. As Chad planned to have Abigail committed, Abigail got a quick divorce from Chad and married Stefan. Luckily for Gabi, Chad was persistent and managed to get Stefan to commit Abigail. Gabi visited Abigail and gloated to Abigail, confessing everything. Abigail attacked Gabi and Chad ran in and broke them up. Abigail had no proof, so Chad continued to fall for Gabi\u2019s lies. Kate convinced Gabi to tell Chad the truth about his child, so Gabi printed a new copy from Kayla\u2019s computer and planned to make it look like Stefan had switched the results, but Stefan almost caught her and she was unable to plant the results in the mansion. Later, by Abigail's request to expose Gabi for her lies, Julie sneaked into the Kiriakis mansion and discovered the test results in Gabi's room. Gabi caught Julie with the evidence, who threatened to tell Chad everything. The two fought and Julie fell down the stairs. Julie was rushed to the hospital shortly after Chad and Sonny came to her aid. Desperate to keep Julie quiet, Gabi sneaked into Julie's room later that night in an attempt to suffocate her with a pillow, but was eventually caught by Abigail who accused her of pushing her down the stairs. Gabi continues to taunt Abigail's illness and gloats innocence... until Julie woke up and eventually told Abigail the truth, who then told Chad. A furious Chad threatened to send Gabi to prison, vowing to separate her from her only daughter the same way she separated Abigail from hers and her son. Abigail however chose not to press charges against Gabi, despite Chad's objection; but she also chose to permanently end her friendship with Gabi and wished her the best as they went on their separate ways.\n\n== Reception ==\nJanet Di Lauro of [[About.com]] said that the character is crazy and \"naughty.\"<ref name=\"BI\" /> Of being the only [[Hispanic]] during her time on ''Days of Our Lives'', Banus stated in 2012: \"I\u2019m definitely grateful.

JJ sneaks into Kyle's apartment, determined to find something that could help him in the investigation. While he's there Kyle and Paige return. Paige helps JJ hide and makes out with Kyle in order to distract him as JJ leaves. Paige finds out that JJ is working for the DEA and agrees to help him. Eve, who also finds out, tells Kyle of JJ's true motives and tips off the police. Kyle confronts JJ who denies his involvement with the cops. It is revealed that [[Clyde Weston]] is Kyle's boss and due to his dissatisfaction, kills Kyle and JJ manages to convince him that he isn't working for the DEA.

JJ arrives at Paige's dorm and finds the door unlocked and her dead, strangled in the shower. He and Eve are both heartbroken.\n\nJJ believes that Clyde killed Paige and tells Jennifer who persuades him to go to the cops. However, when he does, Clyde shows up and JJ pretends he was there to check on Paige's murder investigation. Clyde then gives Roman false information that he saw Chad outside Paige's dorm building around the time she was killed.\n\nJJ later puts Clyde in jail and wants to become a cop but Jennifer and Abigail are against his decision because they both think that he's making too quick of a decision and his mother Jennifer wants him to finish college before he thinks about putting his life in danger. He also begins to pursue a relationship with [[Gabi Hernandez]]. After their break-up, he starts seeing [[Lani Price]] ([[Sal Stowers]]). Things take a worse turn when he shoots his girlfriend's brother  [[Theo Carver]] and gets suspended and charged.

They decide they are better off as friends.\n\nIn December 2018, JJ comes to the aid of Haley Chen, a nurse at University Hospital, who attempted suicide. He befriends her and invites her to Doug's place for the New Year's Eve party. As their connection builds, she confides in him about being an illegal immigrant, and they grow closer and even share few kisses.

When she is eventually arrested, JJ pleads for Haley's forgiveness and in an effort to make up for the mistake, JJ offers to marry Haley in order to help her avoid deportation; she declines the proposal and marries Tripp Dalton instead in order to get a green card.

[[Katorga]], a category of punishment reserved for those convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features associated with labour-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labour, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry.

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Archival documents ===\nStatistical reports made by the [[OGPU]]-[[NKVD]]-[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]]-[[MVD]] between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR).

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982.

[[Katorga]], a category of punishment reserved for those convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features associated with labour-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labour, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work. According to historian [[Anne Applebaum]], katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 [[katorga]] convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /><ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/review/11MINERT.html {{-'}}Gulag': The Other Killing Machine]\".

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f).

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry.

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Archival documents ===\nStatistical reports made by the [[OGPU]]-[[NKVD]]-[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]]-[[MVD]] between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR).

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982.

Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling.\n\nCycling is a [[Oxford blue|discretionary full blue]] sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the [[Varsity Match]] against [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as [[Oxford Blue (colour)|Oxford Blue]]) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Rules of the Dark Blue Bicycle Club|publisher=The Dark Blue Bicycle Club|year=1877|isbn=|location=Bodleian Library, Oxford, G.A.

The Magic Hour.|url=|journal=Cycling|volume=|pages=34|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1881, the club changed its name to the Oxford University Bicycle Club, abbreviated to O.U.Bi.C.,; the \"i\"  distinguishing it from the [[Oxford University Boat Club]]. In Lent Term, 1882, the membership of the club stood at 44.<ref>''Rules, Bye-Laws, Report and List of Members'', Oxford: Oxford University Bicycle Club, 1882.</ref> The club continued as O.U.Bi.C. until it fell dormant in 1903.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alma Mater|first=|date=23 May 1904|title=Varsity Chat|url=|journal=The Athletic News|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885 (not held) and 1895 (abandoned), while over that period the format of the competition had varied considerably, from a road race between the two university towns to a track race meet.  \n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:axford-hc.jpg|thumb|right|OUCC rider Danny Axford on his way to a 4th BUSA Hillclimb victory, at Curbar Gap, Derbyshire]]\nIn early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: \u201cAfter an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\".<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'', Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12.</ref> it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29th January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nDuring the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke,]]<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former [[Giro d'Italia]] rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire.

Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998.  2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the [[Cyclo-cross]] race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Will|last2=Jones|first2=Piers|date=2000|title=Sports Review 2000|url=|journal=University of Oxford Sports Review|volume=|pages=7|via=}}</ref> In 2015, Olivia Withers (L.M.H.), Imogen Kempton (Lincoln Coll.), and Tamara Davenne (Merton Coll.), of the newly formed women's racing squad, won the BUCS \"3-up\" team time trial, with Devenne also winning the BUCS circuit road race.\n\n==Notable alumni<ref>Notability solely in the context of cycling, including achievements before, during and after membership of the club.</ref>==\n* A.

Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling.\n\nCycling is a [[Oxford blue|discretionary full blue]] sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the [[Varsity Match]] against [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as [[Oxford Blue (colour)|Oxford Blue]]) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Rules of the Dark Blue Bicycle Club|publisher=The Dark Blue Bicycle Club|year=1877|isbn=|location=Bodleian Library, Oxford, G.A.

The Magic Hour.|url=|journal=Cycling|volume=|pages=34|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1881, the club changed its name to the Oxford University Bicycle Club, abbreviated to O.U.Bi.C.,; the \"i\"  distinguishing it from the [[Oxford University Boat Club]]. In Lent Term, 1882, the membership of the club stood at 44.<ref>''Rules, Bye-Laws, Report and List of Members'', Oxford: Oxford University Bicycle Club, 1882.</ref> The club continued as O.U.Bi.C. until it fell dormant in 1903.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alma Mater|first=|date=23 May 1904|title=Varsity Chat|url=|journal=The Athletic News|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885 (not held) and 1895 (abandoned), while over that period the format of the competition had varied considerably, from a road race between the two university towns to a track race meet.  \n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:axford-hc.jpg|thumb|right|OUCC rider Danny Axford on his way to a 4th BUSA Hillclimb victory, at Curbar Gap, Derbyshire]]\nIn early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: \u201cAfter an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\".<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'', Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12.</ref> it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29th January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nDuring the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke,]]<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former [[Giro d'Italia]] rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S.

Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998.  2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the [[Cyclo-cross]] race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Will|last2=Jones|first2=Piers|date=2000|title=Sports Review 2000|url=|journal=University of Oxford Sports Review|volume=|pages=7|via=}}</ref> In 2015, Olivia Withers (L.M.H.), Imogen Kempton (Lincoln Coll.), and Tamara Davenne (Merton Coll.), of the newly formed women's racing squad, won the BUCS \"3-up\" team time trial, with Devenne also winning the BUCS circuit road race.\n\n==Notable alumni<ref>Notability solely in the context of cycling, including achievements before, during and after membership of the club.</ref>==\n* A.

It was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later part of [[Sasanian Empire]]. From 5th to 6th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was part of the [[Hephthalite Empire]]. From 6th to 8th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was under the rule of [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khanate]]. Turkic and Chinese migration into central Asia occurred during the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]], and Chinese armies commanded by [[Turks in the Tang military|Turkic generals]] stationed in large parts of central Asia. But Chinese influence ended with the [[An Lushan rebellion]]. From the 9th century on, [[Transoxania]] was under the rule of Turkic [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia. Kara-Khanid ruler [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first Turkic ruler to convert to Islam, most people of Central Asia soon followed. In the 12th century, Transoxania was conquered by Qara Khitai (Western Liao), a sinicized [[Khitan people|Khitan]] dynasty, they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government. In the 13th century, Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], a former vassal of the Qara Khitai.\n\nAlthough [[Turko-Mongol]] infiltration into Central Asia had started early,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n| year = 1983\n| title = Irano-Turkish Relations in the Late Sasanian Period\n| encyclopedia = The Cambridge History of Iran\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| volume = III/1\n| location = Cambridge\n| id = 0-521-24693-8\n| pages = 613\u201324\n}}</ref> as late as the 13th century when [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongol]] armies finally conquered the entire region, the majority of Central Asia's peoples were [[Iranian peoples]] such as [[Sogdians]], [[Bactrians]] and, more ancient, the [[Saka]]\u2013[[Massagetae]] tribes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} It is generally believed that these ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the [[Persian language]], the traditional ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the eastern Islamic lands.<ref name=\"Iranica\">Richard H.

Chlorite and limestone, [[Bactria]], beginning of the 2nd millennium BC]]\nThe heart of Central Asian history goes back to the earliest [[Bronze Age]] colonists of the Tarim Basin were people of Caucasoid physical type who entered probably from the north and west, who may have spoken languages ancestral to the Indo-European [[Tocharian languages]] documented later in the Tarim Basin. These early settlers occupied the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin, where their graves have yielded mummies dated about 1800 BC. They participated in a cultural world centered on the eastern steppes of central Eurasia, including modern northeastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. \n\nThe first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nomads who arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC. These nomads, who spoke Iranian dialects, settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region. At this time, cities such as  Bukhara and Samarkand began to appear as centers of government and culture. By the 5th century BC, the [[Bactria]]n, [[Sogdiana|Soghdian]], and [[Yuezhi|Tokharian]] states dominated the region.\n\nAs China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Iranian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centers of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and settlements in the province of [[Mawarannahr]] (a name given the region after the Arab conquest) in Uzbekistan and farther east in what is today China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Soghdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. Because of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.<ref name=eh>Lubin, Nancy. \"Early history\". In Curtis.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAlexander the Great conquered Sogdiana and Bactria in 327 BC, marrying [[Roxana]], daughter of a local Bactrian chieftain. The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires.\n\n===Early Islamic period===\nThe [[Muslim conquests|conquest of Central Asia]] by Muslim [[Arabs]], which was completed in the 8th century AD, brought to the region a new religion that continues to be dominant. The Arabs first invaded Mawarannahr in the middle of the 7th century through sporadic raids during their conquest of Persia. Available sources on the Arab conquest suggest that the Soghdians and other Iranian peoples of Central Asia were unable to defend their land against the Arabs because of internal divisions and the lack of strong indigenous leadership. The Arabs, on the other hand, were led by a brilliant general, [[Qutaybah ibn Muslim]], and were also highly motivated by the desire to spread [[Islam|their new faith]] (the official beginning of which was in AD 622). Because of these factors, the population of Mawarannahr was easily subdued. The new religion brought by the Arabs spread gradually into the region. The native religious identities, which in some respects were already being displaced by Persian influences before the Arabs arrived, were further displaced in the ensuing centuries. Nevertheless, the destiny of Central Asia as an Islamic region was firmly established by the Arab victory over the Chinese armies in 750 in a [[Battle of Talas|battle]] at the [[Talas River]].<ref name=eip>Lubin, Nancy. \"Early Islamic period\". In Curtis.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nDespite brief Arab rule, Central Asia successfully retained much of its Iranian characteristic, remaining an important center of culture and trade for centuries after the adoption of the new religion. Mawarannahr continued to be an important political player in regional affairs, as it had been under various Persian dynasties. In fact, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which ruled the Arab world for five centuries beginning in 750, was established thanks in great part to assistance from Central Asian supporters in their struggle against the then-ruling [[Umayyad Caliphate]].<ref name=eip/>\n\nDuring the height of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th and 9th centuries, Central Asia and Mawarannahr experienced a truly golden age. Bukhara became one of the leading centers of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world, its magnificence rivaling contemporaneous cultural centers such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the region.<ref name=eip/>\n\nAs the Abbasid Caliphate began to weaken and local Islamic Iranian states emerged as the rulers of Iran and Central Asia, the [[Persian language]] continued its preeminent role in the region as the language of literature and government. The rulers of the eastern section of Iran and of Mawarannahr were Persians. Under the [[Samanids]] and the [[Buyids]], the rich Perso-Islamic culture of Mawarannahr continued to flourish.<ref name=eip/>\n\n===Samanid Empire===\nThe Samanids were a Persian state that reigned for 180 years, encompassing a vast territoriy stretching from Central Asia to West Asia.<ref>Taba\u1e33\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.31, By Minh\u0101j Sir\u0101j J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b</ref><ref>The historical, social and economic setting By M.

In governing their territory, the Samanids modeled their state organization after the [[Abbasids]], mirroring the [[caliph]]'s court and organization.<ref>The Monumental Inscriptions from Early Islamic Iran and Transoxiana By Sheila S. Blair, pg. 27</ref> They were rewarded for supporting the [[Abbasids]] in [[Transoxania]] and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and with their established capitals located in [[Bukhara]], [[Balkh]], [[Samarkand]], and [[Herat]], they carved their kingdom after defeating the [[Saffarids]].<ref name=\"America pg. 123\"/>\n\nThe Samanid Empire was the first native Persian dynasty to arise after the Muslim Arab conquest. The four grandsons of the dynasty's founder, [[Saman Khuda]], had been rewarded with provinces for their faithful service to the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mamun]]: Nuh obtained [[Samarkand]]; Ahmad, [[Fergana]]; Yahya, Shash; and Elyas, [[Herat]]. Ahmad's son Nasr became governor of [[Transoxania]] in 875, but it was his brother and successor, [[Ismail Samani]] who overthrew the Saffarids and the Zaydites of Tabaristan, thus establishing a semiautonomous rule over Transoxania and Khorasan, with Bukhara as his capital.\n\n====Samanids defeat the Saffarids and Zaydids====\nSamanid rule in [[Bukhara]] was not formally recognized by the caliph until the early 10th century when the Saffarid ruler [[Amr-i Laith Saffari|'Amr-i Laith]] had asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, [[Al-Mu'tadid]] however sent the Samanid amir, [[Ismail Samani]], a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].<ref>The book of government, or, Rules for kings: the Siyar al-Muluk, or, Siyasat-nama of Nizam al-Mulk, Ni\u1e93\u0101m al-Mulk, Hubert Darke, pg.18\u201319</ref> The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.\n\nThe two sides fought in [[Balkh]], northern [[Afghanistan]] during the spring of 900. During battle, Ismail was significantly outnumbered as he came out with 20,000 horsemen against Amr's 70,000 strong cavalry.<ref>History of Islam (Vol 3) By Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, pg. 330</ref> Ismail's horsemen were ill-equipped with most having wooden stirrups while some had no shields or lances. Amr-i Laith's cavalry on the other hand, were fully equipped with weapons and armor. Despite fierce fighting, Amr was captured as some of his troops switched sides and joined Ismail.<ref>Ibn Khallikan's biographical dictionary By Ibn Khallik\u0101n, pg.329</ref>\n\nIsma'il thereafter sent an army to Tabaristan in accordance with the caliph's directive.<ref>Taba\u1e33\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.32, By Minh\u0101j Sir\u0101j J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b</ref> The area at that time was then controlled by the [[Zaydid]]s. The Samanid army defeated the [[Zaydid]] ruler and the Samanids gained control of the region.\n\n===Turkification of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Costumes of Uzbek men.jpg|thumb|upright|Clothing of Uzbek men, [[Khiva]]]]\nIn the 9th century, the continued influx of nomads from the northern steppes brought a new group of people into Central Asia. These people were the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] who lived in the great grasslands stretching from [[Mongolia]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Introduced mainly as slave soldiers to the Samanid Dynasty, these Turks served in the armies of all the states of the region, including the Abbasid army. In the late 10th century, as the Samanids began to lose control of [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) and northeastern Iran, some of these soldiers came to positions of power in the government of the region, and eventually established their own states, albeit highly [[Persianate society|Persianized]]. With the emergence of a Turkic ruling group in the region, other Turkic tribes began to migrate to Transoxiana.<ref name=tm>Lubin, Nancy. \"Turkification of Mawarannahr\". In Curtis.</ref>\n\nThe first of the Turkic states in the region was the Persianate [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], established in the last years of the 10th century. The Ghaznavid state, which captured Samanid domains south of the [[Amu Darya]], was able to conquer large areas of Iran, [[Afghanistan]], and northern [[India]] apart from Central Asia, during the reign of [[Mahmud of Ghazna|Sultan Mahmud]]. The Ghaznavids were closely followed by the Turkic [[Qarakhanids]], who took the Samanid capital Bukhara in 999 AD, and ruled Transoxiana for the next two centuries. Samarkand was made the capital of the Western Qarakhanid state.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\n\nThe dominance of Ghazna was curtailed, however, when the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] led themselves into the western part of the region, conquering the Ghaznavid territory of [[Khorazm]] (also spelled Khorezm and Khwarazm).<ref name=tm/> The Seljuks also defeated the Qarakhanids, but did not annex their territories outright.

The Seljuk Empire then split into states ruled by various local Turkic and Iranian rulers. The culture and intellectual life of the region continued unaffected by such political changes, however. Turkic tribes from the north continued to migrate into the region during this period.<ref name=tm/> The power of the Seljuks however became diminished when the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] was defeated by the [[Kara-Khitans]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] in 1141.\n\nIn the late 12th century, a Turkic leader of Khorazm, which is the region south of the Aral Sea, united Khorazm, Transoxiana, and Iran under his rule. Under the rule of the Khorazm [[shah]] [[Kutbeddin Muhammad]] and his son, [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|Muhammad II]], Transoxiana continued to be prosperous and rich while maintaining the region's Perso-Islamic identity. However, a new incursion of nomads from the north soon changed this situation. This time the invader was [[Genghis Khan]] with his [[Mongol]] armies.<ref name=tm/>\n\n===Mongol period===\nThe Mongol invasion of Central Asia is one of the turning points in the history of the region. The Mongols had such a lasting impact because they established the tradition that the legitimate ruler of any Central Asian state could only be a blood descendant of Genghis Khan.<ref name=mp>Lubin, Nancy. \"Mongol period\". In Curtis.</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol conquest of Central Asia]], which took place from 1219 to 1225, led to a wholesale change in the population of Mawarannahr. The conquest quickened the process of Turkification in some parts of the region because, although the armies of Genghis Khan were led by Mongols, they were made up mostly of Turkic tribes that had been incorporated into the Mongol armies as the tribes were encountered in the Mongols' southward sweep. As these armies settled in Mawarannahr, they intermixed with the local populations which did not flee. Another effect of the Mongol conquest was the large-scale damage the soldiers inflicted on cities such as Bukhara and on regions such as Khorazm. As the leading province of a wealthy state, Khorazm was treated especially severely. The [[irrigation]] networks in the region suffered extensive damage that was not repaired for several generations.<ref name=mp/> Many Iranian-speaking populations were forced to flee southwards in order to avoid persecution.\n\n===Rule of Mongols and Timurids===\n[[File:Teymur.jpg|thumb|upright|Timur feasts in [[Samarkand]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, [[Yassa|Mongol law]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatai]], the second son of Genghis. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united.<ref name=rt>Lubin, Nancy. \"Rule of Timur\". In Curtis.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn the early 14th century, however, as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts, the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence. One tribal chieftain, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr. Although he was not a descendant of Genghis, Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, Iran, the [[Caucasus]], Asia Minor, and the southern steppe region north of the [[Aral Sea]]. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of China in 1405.<ref name=rt/>\n\nTimur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital, Samarkand, numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered. By supporting such people, Timur imbued his empire with a very rich Perso-Islamic culture. During Timur's reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarkand and other population centers. Timur also patronized scientists and artists; his grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the [[Chaghatai dialect]], became a [[literary language]] in its own right in Mawarannahr, although the Timurids were Persianate in nature. The greatest Chaghataid writer, [[Ali Shir Nava'i]], was active in the city of [[Herat]], now in northwestern Afghanistan, in the second half of the 15th century.<ref name=rt/>\n\nThe Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr.<ref name=rt/> Under the leadership of [[Muhammad Shaybani]], the Uzbeks conquered the key cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] in 1505 and 1507, respectively, and founded the [[Khanate of Bukhara]].\n\n===Uzbek period===\n[[File:Mirza Abdulhuq and Rustom Beg in 1841.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[lithography|lithograph]] of two Uzbek [[Khan (title)|Khans]] from [[Afghanistan]] in 1841.]]\nBy 1510 the Uzbeks had completed their conquest of Central Asia{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, including the territory of the present-day Uzbekistan. Of the states they established, the most powerful, the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], centered on the city of Bukhara. The khanate controlled Mawarannahr, especially the region of [[Tashkent]], the [[Fergana Valley]] in the east, and northern Afghanistan. A second Uzbek state, the [[Khanate of Khiva]] was established in the oasis of [[Khorazm]] at the mouth of the Amu Darya. The Khanate of Bukhara was initially led by the energetic [[Shaybanid Dynasty]], the successors of [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. The Shaybanids initially competed against Iran for a few years, which was led by the [[Safavid Dynasty]], for the rich far-eastern territory of present-day Iran.<ref name=\"Eraly2007\">{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors Of The Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Moghuls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7kPQs8llvkC&pg=PT25|date=17 September 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-93-5118-093-7|page=25}}</ref> The struggle with the Safavids also had a religious aspect because the Uzbeks were [[Sunni]] Muslims, and Iran was [[Shia]].<ref name=up>Lubin, Nancy. \"Uzbek period\".

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Shaybanid Dynasty was replaced by the [[Janid Dynasty]].<ref name=up/>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the weakness of the Uzbek khanates in this period was the general decline of trade moving through the region. This change had begun in the previous century when ocean trade routes were established from Europe to India and China, circumventing the Silk Route. As European-dominated ocean transport expanded and some trading centers were destroyed, cities such as Bukhara, [[Merv]], and Samarkand in the Khanate of Bukhora and [[Khiva]] and [[Urganch]] (Urgench) in Khorazm began to steadily decline.<ref name=up/>\n\nThe Uzbeks' struggle with Iran also led to the cultural isolation of Central Asia from the rest of the Islamic world. In addition to these problems, the struggle with the nomads from the northern steppe continued. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads and Mongols continually raided the Uzbek khanates, causing widespread damage and disruption. In the beginning of the 18th century, the Khanate of Bukhara lost the fertile Fergana region, and a [[Khanate of Kokand|new Uzbek khanate]] was formed in [[Quqon]].<ref name=up/>\n\n===Afghan Pashtun conquest===\n{{main article|Balkh|Kunduz|Maymana}}\nAn Uzbek Khanate existed in [[Maimana]].<ref name=\"Chaffetz1981\">{{cite book|author=David Chaffetz|title=A Journey Through Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gUUCK2xrijIC&pg=PA63&dq=central+asian+features+turkish+popular+blood#v=onepage|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10064-7|pages=63\u2013}}</ref> The Pashtuns battled and conquered the Uzbeks and forced them into the status of ruled people who were discriminated against.<ref name=\"Williams2011\">{{cite book|author=Brian Glyn Williams|title=Afghanistan Declassified: A Guide to America's Longest War|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cYtXJhByzoEC&pg=PA32&dq=uzbeks+afghanistan#v=onepage|date=22 September 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0615-9|pages=32\u2013}}</ref>{{when|date=December 2015}} Out of anti-Russian strategic interests, the British assisted the Afghan conquest of the Uzbek Khanates, giving weapons to the Afghans and backed the Afghan colonization of northern Afghanistan which involved sending massive amounts of Pashtun colonists onto Uzbek land and British literature from the period demonized the Uzbeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/from-slavers-to-warlords-descriptions-of-afghanistans-uzbeks-in-western-writing/ |title= From 'Slavers' to 'Warlords': Descriptions of Afghanistan's Uzbeks in western writing |last1=Bleuer |first1=Christian |date=17 October 2014 |website=Afghanistan Analysts Network |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>{{when|date=December 2015}} Soviet era arrivals in Afghanistan from Uzbekistan are referred to as Jogi.<ref>{{cite news |last=Saboory |first=Ghafoor |date=17 July 2015 <!-- 14:03 --> |title=Jogies Leading Impoverished Life in Balkh |url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/20495-jogies-leading-impoverished-life-in-balkh |newspaper=Afghanistan News-TOLOnews.com |location= |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920145418/http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/20495-jogies-leading-impoverished-life-in-balkh |archive-date=2016-09-20 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Russo-Soviet era===\n[[File:Defence of the Samarkand Citadel.JPG|thumb|The Defence of the Samarkand Citadel in 1868.

In 1868 the Khanate of Bukhara signed a treaty with Russia making Bukhara a Russian [[protectorate]].

However, this move increased [[Uzbek nationalism]], which had long resented Soviet policies such as the imposition of cotton monoculture and the suppression of [[Islam]]ic traditions. In the late 1980s, the liberalized atmosphere of the Soviet Union under Mikhail S.

It was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later part of [[Sasanian Empire]]. From 5th to 6th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was part of the [[Hephthalite Empire]]. From 6th to 8th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was under the rule of [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khanate]]. Turkic and Chinese migration into central Asia occurred during the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]], and Chinese armies commanded by [[Turks in the Tang military|Turkic generals]] stationed in large parts of central Asia. But Chinese influence ended with the [[An Lushan rebellion]]. From the 9th century on, [[Transoxania]] was under the rule of Turkic [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia. Kara-Khanid ruler [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first Turkic ruler to convert to Islam, most people of Central Asia soon followed. In the 12th century, Transoxania was conquered by Qara Khitai (Western Liao), a sinicized [[Khitan people|Khitan]] dynasty, they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government. In the 13th century, Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], a former vassal of the Qara Khitai.\n\nAlthough [[Turko-Mongol]] infiltration into Central Asia had started early,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n| year = 1983\n| title = Irano-Turkish Relations in the Late Sasanian Period\n| encyclopedia = The Cambridge History of Iran\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| volume = III/1\n| location = Cambridge\n| id = 0-521-24693-8\n| pages = 613\u201324\n}}</ref> as late as the 13th century when [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongol]] armies finally conquered the entire region, the majority of Central Asia's peoples were [[Iranian peoples]] such as [[Sogdians]], [[Bactrians]] and, more ancient, the [[Saka]]\u2013[[Massagetae]] tribes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} It is generally believed that these ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the [[Persian language]], the traditional ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the eastern Islamic lands.<ref name=\"Iranica\">Richard H.

These early settlers occupied the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin, where their graves have yielded mummies dated about 1800 BC. They participated in a cultural world centered on the eastern steppes of central Eurasia, including modern northeastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. \n\nThe first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nomads who arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC. These nomads, who spoke Iranian dialects, settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region. At this time, cities such as  Bukhara and Samarkand began to appear as centers of government and culture. By the 5th century BC, the [[Bactria]]n, [[Sogdiana|Soghdian]], and [[Yuezhi|Tokharian]] states dominated the region.\n\nAs China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Iranian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centers of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and settlements in the province of [[Mawarannahr]] (a name given the region after the Arab conquest) in Uzbekistan and farther east in what is today China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Soghdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. Because of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.<ref name=eh>Lubin, Nancy. \"Early history\".

The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires.\n\n===Early Islamic period===\nThe [[Muslim conquests|conquest of Central Asia]] by Muslim [[Arabs]], which was completed in the 8th century AD, brought to the region a new religion that continues to be dominant. The Arabs first invaded Mawarannahr in the middle of the 7th century through sporadic raids during their conquest of Persia. Available sources on the Arab conquest suggest that the Soghdians and other Iranian peoples of Central Asia were unable to defend their land against the Arabs because of internal divisions and the lack of strong indigenous leadership. The Arabs, on the other hand, were led by a brilliant general, [[Qutaybah ibn Muslim]], and were also highly motivated by the desire to spread [[Islam|their new faith]] (the official beginning of which was in AD 622). Because of these factors, the population of Mawarannahr was easily subdued. The new religion brought by the Arabs spread gradually into the region. The native religious identities, which in some respects were already being displaced by Persian influences before the Arabs arrived, were further displaced in the ensuing centuries. Nevertheless, the destiny of Central Asia as an Islamic region was firmly established by the Arab victory over the Chinese armies in 750 in a [[Battle of Talas|battle]] at the [[Talas River]].<ref name=eip>Lubin, Nancy. \"Early Islamic period\". In Curtis.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nDespite brief Arab rule, Central Asia successfully retained much of its Iranian characteristic, remaining an important center of culture and trade for centuries after the adoption of the new religion. Mawarannahr continued to be an important political player in regional affairs, as it had been under various Persian dynasties. In fact, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which ruled the Arab world for five centuries beginning in 750, was established thanks in great part to assistance from Central Asian supporters in their struggle against the then-ruling [[Umayyad Caliphate]].<ref name=eip/>\n\nDuring the height of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th and 9th centuries, Central Asia and Mawarannahr experienced a truly golden age. Bukhara became one of the leading centers of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world, its magnificence rivaling contemporaneous cultural centers such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the region.<ref name=eip/>\n\nAs the Abbasid Caliphate began to weaken and local Islamic Iranian states emerged as the rulers of Iran and Central Asia, the [[Persian language]] continued its preeminent role in the region as the language of literature and government. The rulers of the eastern section of Iran and of Mawarannahr were Persians. Under the [[Samanids]] and the [[Buyids]], the rich Perso-Islamic culture of Mawarannahr continued to flourish.<ref name=eip/>\n\n===Samanid Empire===\nThe Samanids were a Persian state that reigned for 180 years, encompassing a vast territoriy stretching from Central Asia to West Asia.<ref>Taba\u1e33\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.31, By Minh\u0101j Sir\u0101j J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b</ref><ref>The historical, social and economic setting By M.

The four grandsons of the dynasty's founder, [[Saman Khuda]], had been rewarded with provinces for their faithful service to the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mamun]]: Nuh obtained [[Samarkand]]; Ahmad, [[Fergana]]; Yahya, Shash; and Elyas, [[Herat]]. Ahmad's son Nasr became governor of [[Transoxania]] in 875, but it was his brother and successor, [[Ismail Samani]] who overthrew the Saffarids and the Zaydites of Tabaristan, thus establishing a semiautonomous rule over Transoxania and Khorasan, with Bukhara as his capital.\n\n====Samanids defeat the Saffarids and Zaydids====\nSamanid rule in [[Bukhara]] was not formally recognized by the caliph until the early 10th century when the Saffarid ruler [[Amr-i Laith Saffari|'Amr-i Laith]] had asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, [[Al-Mu'tadid]] however sent the Samanid amir, [[Ismail Samani]], a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].<ref>The book of government, or, Rules for kings: the Siyar al-Muluk, or, Siyasat-nama of Nizam al-Mulk, Ni\u1e93\u0101m al-Mulk, Hubert Darke, pg.18\u201319</ref> The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.\n\nThe two sides fought in [[Balkh]], northern [[Afghanistan]] during the spring of 900. During battle, Ismail was significantly outnumbered as he came out with 20,000 horsemen against Amr's 70,000 strong cavalry.<ref>History of Islam (Vol 3) By Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, pg. 330</ref> Ismail's horsemen were ill-equipped with most having wooden stirrups while some had no shields or lances.

Despite fierce fighting, Amr was captured as some of his troops switched sides and joined Ismail.<ref>Ibn Khallikan's biographical dictionary By Ibn Khallik\u0101n, pg.329</ref>\n\nIsma'il thereafter sent an army to Tabaristan in accordance with the caliph's directive.<ref>Taba\u1e33\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.32, By Minh\u0101j Sir\u0101j J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b</ref> The area at that time was then controlled by the [[Zaydid]]s. The Samanid army defeated the [[Zaydid]] ruler and the Samanids gained control of the region.\n\n===Turkification of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Costumes of Uzbek men.jpg|thumb|upright|Clothing of Uzbek men, [[Khiva]]]]\nIn the 9th century, the continued influx of nomads from the northern steppes brought a new group of people into Central Asia. These people were the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] who lived in the great grasslands stretching from [[Mongolia]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Introduced mainly as slave soldiers to the Samanid Dynasty, these Turks served in the armies of all the states of the region, including the Abbasid army. In the late 10th century, as the Samanids began to lose control of [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) and northeastern Iran, some of these soldiers came to positions of power in the government of the region, and eventually established their own states, albeit highly [[Persianate society|Persianized]]. With the emergence of a Turkic ruling group in the region, other Turkic tribes began to migrate to Transoxiana.<ref name=tm>Lubin, Nancy. \"Turkification of Mawarannahr\". In Curtis.</ref>\n\nThe first of the Turkic states in the region was the Persianate [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], established in the last years of the 10th century. The Ghaznavid state, which captured Samanid domains south of the [[Amu Darya]], was able to conquer large areas of Iran, [[Afghanistan]], and northern [[India]] apart from Central Asia, during the reign of [[Mahmud of Ghazna|Sultan Mahmud]]. The Ghaznavids were closely followed by the Turkic [[Qarakhanids]], who took the Samanid capital Bukhara in 999 AD, and ruled Transoxiana for the next two centuries. Samarkand was made the capital of the Western Qarakhanid state.<ref name=\"UNESCO\" />\n\nThe dominance of Ghazna was curtailed, however, when the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] led themselves into the western part of the region, conquering the Ghaznavid territory of [[Khorazm]] (also spelled Khorezm and Khwarazm).<ref name=tm/> The Seljuks also defeated the Qarakhanids, but did not annex their territories outright. Instead they made the Qarakhanids a vassal state.<ref name=\"sinor\">{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter.

The Seljuk Empire then split into states ruled by various local Turkic and Iranian rulers. The culture and intellectual life of the region continued unaffected by such political changes, however. Turkic tribes from the north continued to migrate into the region during this period.<ref name=tm/> The power of the Seljuks however became diminished when the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] was defeated by the [[Kara-Khitans]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] in 1141.\n\nIn the late 12th century, a Turkic leader of Khorazm, which is the region south of the Aral Sea, united Khorazm, Transoxiana, and Iran under his rule. Under the rule of the Khorazm [[shah]] [[Kutbeddin Muhammad]] and his son, [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|Muhammad II]], Transoxiana continued to be prosperous and rich while maintaining the region's Perso-Islamic identity. However, a new incursion of nomads from the north soon changed this situation. This time the invader was [[Genghis Khan]] with his [[Mongol]] armies.<ref name=tm/>\n\n===Mongol period===\nThe Mongol invasion of Central Asia is one of the turning points in the history of the region. The Mongols had such a lasting impact because they established the tradition that the legitimate ruler of any Central Asian state could only be a blood descendant of Genghis Khan.<ref name=mp>Lubin, Nancy. \"Mongol period\". In Curtis.</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol conquest of Central Asia]], which took place from 1219 to 1225, led to a wholesale change in the population of Mawarannahr. The conquest quickened the process of Turkification in some parts of the region because, although the armies of Genghis Khan were led by Mongols, they were made up mostly of Turkic tribes that had been incorporated into the Mongol armies as the tribes were encountered in the Mongols' southward sweep. As these armies settled in Mawarannahr, they intermixed with the local populations which did not flee. Another effect of the Mongol conquest was the large-scale damage the soldiers inflicted on cities such as Bukhara and on regions such as Khorazm. As the leading province of a wealthy state, Khorazm was treated especially severely. The [[irrigation]] networks in the region suffered extensive damage that was not repaired for several generations.<ref name=mp/> Many Iranian-speaking populations were forced to flee southwards in order to avoid persecution.\n\n===Rule of Mongols and Timurids===\n[[File:Teymur.jpg|thumb|upright|Timur feasts in [[Samarkand]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, [[Yassa|Mongol law]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatai]], the second son of Genghis. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united.<ref name=rt>Lubin, Nancy. \"Rule of Timur\". In Curtis.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn the early 14th century, however, as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts, the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence. One tribal chieftain, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr. Although he was not a descendant of Genghis, Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, Iran, the [[Caucasus]], Asia Minor, and the southern steppe region north of the [[Aral Sea]]. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of China in 1405.<ref name=rt/>\n\nTimur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital, Samarkand, numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered. By supporting such people, Timur imbued his empire with a very rich Perso-Islamic culture. During Timur's reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarkand and other population centers. Timur also patronized scientists and artists; his grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the [[Chaghatai dialect]], became a [[literary language]] in its own right in Mawarannahr, although the Timurids were Persianate in nature. The greatest Chaghataid writer, [[Ali Shir Nava'i]], was active in the city of [[Herat]], now in northwestern Afghanistan, in the second half of the 15th century.<ref name=rt/>\n\nThe Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr.<ref name=rt/> Under the leadership of [[Muhammad Shaybani]], the Uzbeks conquered the key cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] in 1505 and 1507, respectively, and founded the [[Khanate of Bukhara]].\n\n===Uzbek period===\n[[File:Mirza Abdulhuq and Rustom Beg in 1841.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[lithography|lithograph]] of two Uzbek [[Khan (title)|Khans]] from [[Afghanistan]] in 1841.]]\nBy 1510 the Uzbeks had completed their conquest of Central Asia{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, including the territory of the present-day Uzbekistan. Of the states they established, the most powerful, the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], centered on the city of Bukhara. The khanate controlled Mawarannahr, especially the region of [[Tashkent]], the [[Fergana Valley]] in the east, and northern Afghanistan. A second Uzbek state, the [[Khanate of Khiva]] was established in the oasis of [[Khorazm]] at the mouth of the Amu Darya. The Khanate of Bukhara was initially led by the energetic [[Shaybanid Dynasty]], the successors of [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. The Shaybanids initially competed against Iran for a few years, which was led by the [[Safavid Dynasty]], for the rich far-eastern territory of present-day Iran.<ref name=\"Eraly2007\">{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors Of The Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Moghuls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7kPQs8llvkC&pg=PT25|date=17 September 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-93-5118-093-7|page=25}}</ref> The struggle with the Safavids also had a religious aspect because the Uzbeks were [[Sunni]] Muslims, and Iran was [[Shia]].<ref name=up>Lubin, Nancy. \"Uzbek period\".

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Shaybanid Dynasty was replaced by the [[Janid Dynasty]].<ref name=up/>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the weakness of the Uzbek khanates in this period was the general decline of trade moving through the region. This change had begun in the previous century when ocean trade routes were established from Europe to India and China, circumventing the Silk Route. As European-dominated ocean transport expanded and some trading centers were destroyed, cities such as Bukhara, [[Merv]], and Samarkand in the Khanate of Bukhora and [[Khiva]] and [[Urganch]] (Urgench) in Khorazm began to steadily decline.<ref name=up/>\n\nThe Uzbeks' struggle with Iran also led to the cultural isolation of Central Asia from the rest of the Islamic world. In addition to these problems, the struggle with the nomads from the northern steppe continued. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads and Mongols continually raided the Uzbek khanates, causing widespread damage and disruption. In the beginning of the 18th century, the Khanate of Bukhara lost the fertile Fergana region, and a [[Khanate of Kokand|new Uzbek khanate]] was formed in [[Quqon]].<ref name=up/>\n\n===Afghan Pashtun conquest===\n{{main article|Balkh|Kunduz|Maymana}}\nAn Uzbek Khanate existed in [[Maimana]].<ref name=\"Chaffetz1981\">{{cite book|author=David Chaffetz|title=A Journey Through Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gUUCK2xrijIC&pg=PA63&dq=central+asian+features+turkish+popular+blood#v=onepage|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10064-7|pages=63\u2013}}</ref> The Pashtuns battled and conquered the Uzbeks and forced them into the status of ruled people who were discriminated against.<ref name=\"Williams2011\">{{cite book|author=Brian Glyn Williams|title=Afghanistan Declassified: A Guide to America's Longest War|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cYtXJhByzoEC&pg=PA32&dq=uzbeks+afghanistan#v=onepage|date=22 September 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0615-9|pages=32\u2013}}</ref>{{when|date=December 2015}} Out of anti-Russian strategic interests, the British assisted the Afghan conquest of the Uzbek Khanates, giving weapons to the Afghans and backed the Afghan colonization of northern Afghanistan which involved sending massive amounts of Pashtun colonists onto Uzbek land and British literature from the period demonized the Uzbeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/from-slavers-to-warlords-descriptions-of-afghanistans-uzbeks-in-western-writing/ |title= From 'Slavers' to 'Warlords': Descriptions of Afghanistan's Uzbeks in western writing |last1=Bleuer |first1=Christian |date=17 October 2014 |website=Afghanistan Analysts Network |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>{{when|date=December 2015}} Soviet era arrivals in Afghanistan from Uzbekistan are referred to as Jogi.<ref>{{cite news |last=Saboory |first=Ghafoor |date=17 July 2015 <!-- 14:03 --> |title=Jogies Leading Impoverished Life in Balkh |url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/20495-jogies-leading-impoverished-life-in-balkh |newspaper=Afghanistan News-TOLOnews.com |location= |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920145418/http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/20495-jogies-leading-impoverished-life-in-balkh |archive-date=2016-09-20 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Russo-Soviet era===\n[[File:Defence of the Samarkand Citadel.JPG|thumb|The Defence of the Samarkand Citadel in 1868.

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.<ref>Gilbert, Annie, ''All My Afternoons'', p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Brady and [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera]] families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

Bell]], started writing for ''Days of Our Lives'' in 1966 and continued with the show until 1975, two years after he had created his own successful soap, ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', for rival network CBS. He continued with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many changes to the head writer position occurred. In the early 1980s, [[Margaret DePriest]] helped stabilize the show with her serial killer storyline. Later head writers, such as [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], built on that stability and crafted storylines of their own, temporarily helping to bringing up the program's ratings. Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnover continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of ''Passions'' after rejoining ''Days'' \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.\n\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008.

Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans. [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[KSL-TV]] moved the show to late nights at 1:05&nbsp;a.m. on September 9, 2013 for unknown reasons, though it was rumored to be due to a romantic plot line between gay characters [[Will Horton]] and [[Sonny Kiriakis]]; the station is owned by the [[Bonneville International|broadcasting arm]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]].<ref name=\"slt-ksl-gay-daytime-channel\">{{cite web|title=KSL won't be airing 'Days of Our Lives' during day |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002034629/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Nielsen ratings history===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2020}}\nEnd of season number of metered viewers (listed as a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] share in millions) and ranking (against other soap operas) from the first broadcast to the reporting week of August 24 to 28, 2015.\n{{main|List of US daytime soap opera ratings#1960s}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A sunset variant of the CGI sequence (which had been used for the closing credits from 1993 to 2001) remains in use as Corday Productions' closing credit [[vanity card]].\n{{listen\n| filename    = Daysofou.ogg\n| title       = ''Days of Our Lives'' opening theme (1973)\n| description = Narrated by Macdonald Carey\n| format      = [[Ogg]]}} The only major visual change to the title sequence was in 1993 when the show began using a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animated]] hourglass and backdrop.<ref name = \"credits\"/>\n\nFrom the show's debut in 1965 until March 1966, announcer [[Ed Prentiss]] spoke the aforementioned opening phrase, following it with the notation ''\"Days of Our Lives,'' a new dramatic serial starring Macdonald Carey.\"<ref name=\"credits\"/> Carey, who had played [[Tom Horton|Dr. Thomas Horton]] since the show's premiere, took over reading the opening epitaph in April 1966; for the following 28 years, his introductory voiceover added with \"This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the ''Days of Our Lives''.\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Milestones: MacDonald Carey obituary|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980442,00.html|magazine=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=April 4, 1994|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}</ref> After Carey's death from [[lung cancer]] in April 1994, the secondary part of the introduction was removed from the sequence out of respect for Carey and his family.

After the Cordays approved their third submission, one Hart developed in reminiscence to organ music he remembered hearing when his mother listened to radio soaps, Albertine was brought in to write the orchestration for the piece, adding a flute-and-bells broken arpeggio borrowed directly from his 1952 piece \"Music for Barefoot Ballerinas\" and a bridge section for the extended theme music.<ref name=\"jason47-daystheme\">{{cite web|title=The History of the \"Days of Our Lives\" Theme Song|url=http://www.jason47.com/days/themeinfo.html|website=Jason47's \"Days\" Website|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"song\">{{cite web|title=Bobby Hart Biography|url=http://music.yahoo.com/bobby-hart/biography/|website=Yahoo!

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.<ref>Gilbert, Annie, ''All My Afternoons'', p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Brady and [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera]] families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

Bell]], started writing for ''Days of Our Lives'' in 1966 and continued with the show until 1975, two years after he had created his own successful soap, ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', for rival network CBS. He continued with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many changes to the head writer position occurred. In the early 1980s, [[Margaret DePriest]] helped stabilize the show with her serial killer storyline. Later head writers, such as [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], built on that stability and crafted storylines of their own, temporarily helping to bringing up the program's ratings. Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnover continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of ''Passions'' after rejoining ''Days'' \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.\n\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008.

Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans. [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[KSL-TV]] moved the show to late nights at 1:05&nbsp;a.m. on September 9, 2013 for unknown reasons, though it was rumored to be due to a romantic plot line between gay characters [[Will Horton]] and [[Sonny Kiriakis]]; the station is owned by the [[Bonneville International|broadcasting arm]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]].<ref name=\"slt-ksl-gay-daytime-channel\">{{cite web|title=KSL won't be airing 'Days of Our Lives' during day |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002034629/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Nielsen ratings history===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2020}}\nEnd of season number of metered viewers (listed as a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] share in millions) and ranking (against other soap operas) from the first broadcast to the reporting week of August 24 to 28, 2015.\n{{main|List of US daytime soap opera ratings#1960s}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

After the Cordays approved their third submission, one Hart developed in reminiscence to organ music he remembered hearing when his mother listened to radio soaps, Albertine was brought in to write the orchestration for the piece, adding a flute-and-bells broken arpeggio borrowed directly from his 1952 piece \"Music for Barefoot Ballerinas\" and a bridge section for the extended theme music.<ref name=\"jason47-daystheme\">{{cite web|title=The History of the \"Days of Our Lives\" Theme Song|url=http://www.jason47.com/days/themeinfo.html|website=Jason47's \"Days\" Website|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"song\">{{cite web|title=Bobby Hart Biography|url=http://music.yahoo.com/bobby-hart/biography/|website=Yahoo!

(The elder Aniston was not among the ''Days'' cast members to have guest starred on ''Friends''.) The storyline itself, however, was paradoxical as ''Friends'' was set in [[New York City]] (which was the taping location for fellow NBC soap ''Another World'' \u2013 one of four soap operas that aired on the network during the sitcom's run \u2013 from its premiere in May 1964 until that serial ended in June 1999), whereas ''Days of Our Lives'' is shot in [[Burbank, California]] at what was then known as [[The Burbank Studios|NBC Studios]] (located {{convert|2|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} from the [[Warner Bros.

It saw [[Richard O'Sullivan]] reprise the role of Robin Tripp, one of the lead characters in the sitcom ''[[Man About the House]]'', which had ended on 7 April 1976, and co-starred [[Tessa Wyatt]] as Robin's girlfriend \u2013 and later wife \u2013 Vicky, and [[Tony Britton]] as her father.  As well as playing a couple in Robin's Nest, Richard O'Sullivan and Tessa Wyatt were a couple in real life at the time having one son, Jamie O'Sullivan.\n\nIn the Series 5 episode \"Never Look A Gift Horse\", in the final scene Robin climbs onto the rocking horse and says \"Well Bess, which way now?\"  This is a reference to the tv series ''Dick Turpin'' in which Richard O'Sullivan was also starring as the title character at the time.\n\n==Format==\nIn the first episode Robin and Vicky, who share a flat over a Chinese take-away, discover that the tenants have disappeared owing rent to the landlord, Vicky's father James Nichols. It is the practical Vicky who comes up with the perfect solution: Robin should take over the take-away and convert it into a bistro (The \"Robin's Nest\" of the title). Robin cannot afford to go it alone so he has to go cap-in-hand to Vicky's father ([[Tony Britton]]), to ask him to be his business partner. Although James disapproves of Robin (believing him to be beneath his daughter), he knows a sensible business deal when it is offered to him \u2013 despite his failings, Robin is a brilliant chef \u2013 and he agrees. Lots of tension and misunderstandings are to arise from their mismatched relationship.\n\nCreators and writers [[Brian Cooke]] and [[Johnnie Mortimer]] had to gain special permission from the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), then the regularly body for commercial television in Britain, to be able to portray an unmarried couple living together; special concern arose at scenes in which Robin and Vicky were seen in an obvious state of undress in bed. In 1978, Robin and Vicky married and two years later had a set of twins, who they eventually name Lucy and James Alexander Tripp . At the end of the last episode, Vicky tells Robin that she's pregnant again.\n\n==Other characters==\nOther characters included:\n\n* The one-armed Irish kitchen hand Albert Riddle ([[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]]), who always broke more crockery than he cleaned, and who once asked Robin's culinary advice; unable to cook egg on toast, he asked Robin \"How do you stop the egg dribbling into the bottom of the toaster, Mr Tripp?\".\n* Vicky's mother Marion (divorced from her father) would occasionally appear, played first by [[Honor Blackman]], later by [[Barbara Murray]].\n* Gertrude, Albert's girlfriend, played by ex-''Crossroads'' actress Peggy Aitchison.\n\nRobin's Nest screenwriter George Layton appeared as Vernon Potter, a former student who was at college with Robin Tripp, in a few episodes. \n\nThe show was remade in the United States as ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'', a sequel to ''[[Three's Company]]'' \u2013 originally based on ''Man About the House'' \u2013 but was unsuccessful. In [[2004 in television|2004]], a Polish version was screened, named ''Dziupla Cezara''.\n\n==Theme music score==\nStar of the show [[Richard O'Sullivan]] wrote the theme music for the programme, which was arranged and performed by [[The Shadows]]'s [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]].\n\n==DVD releases==\nAll six series of ''Robin's Nest'' have been released on DVD in the UK (Region 2). \n\nAll six series have also been released on DVD in Australia (Region 4). Series One and Two on 2 April 2009.

It saw [[Richard O'Sullivan]] reprise the role of Robin Tripp, one of the lead characters in the sitcom ''[[Man About the House]]'', which had ended on 7 April 1976, and co-starred [[Tessa Wyatt]] as Robin's girlfriend \u2013 and later wife \u2013 Vicky, and [[Tony Britton]] as her father.  As well as playing a couple in Robin's Nest, Richard O'Sullivan and Tessa Wyatt were a couple in real life at the time having one son, Jamie O'Sullivan.\n\nIn the Series 5 episode \"Never Look A Gift Horse\", in the final scene Robin climbs onto the rocking horse and says \"Well Bess, which way now?\"  This is a reference to the tv series \"Dick Turpin\" in which Richard O'Sullivan was also starring as the title character at the time.\n\n==Format==\nIn the first episode Robin and Vicky, who share a flat over a Chinese take-away, discover that the tenants have disappeared owing rent to the landlord, Vicky's father James Nichols. It is the practical Vicky who comes up with the perfect solution: Robin should take over the take-away and convert it into a bistro (The \"Robin's Nest\" of the title). Robin cannot afford to go it alone so he has to go cap-in-hand to Vicky's father ([[Tony Britton]]), to ask him to be his business partner. Although James disapproves of Robin (believing him to be beneath his daughter), he knows a sensible business deal when it is offered to him \u2013 despite his failings, Robin is a brilliant chef \u2013 and he agrees. Lots of tension and misunderstandings are to arise from their mismatched relationship.\n\nCreators and writers [[Brian Cooke]] and [[Johnnie Mortimer]] had to gain special permission from the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), then the regularly body for commercial television in Britain, to be able to portray an unmarried couple living together; special concern arose at scenes in which Robin and Vicky were seen in an obvious state of undress in bed. In 1978, Robin and Vicky married and two years later had a set of twins, who they eventually name Lucy and James Alexander Tripp . At the end of the last episode, Vicky tells Robin that she's pregnant again.\n\n==Other characters==\nOther characters included:\n\n* The one-armed Irish kitchen hand Albert Riddle ([[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]]), who always broke more crockery than he cleaned, and who once asked Robin's culinary advice; unable to cook egg on toast, he asked Robin \"How do you stop the egg dribbling into the bottom of the toaster, Mr Tripp?\".\n* Vicky's mother Marion (divorced from her father) would occasionally appear, played first by [[Honor Blackman]], later by [[Barbara Murray]].\n* Gertrude, Albert's girlfriend, played by ex-''Crossroads'' actress Peggy Aitchison.\n\nRobin's Nest screenwriter George Layton appeared as Vernon Potter, a former student who was at college with Robin Tripp, in a few episodes. \n\nThe show was remade in the United States as ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'', a sequel to ''[[Three's Company]]'' \u2013 originally based on ''Man About the House'' \u2013 but was unsuccessful. In [[2004 in television|2004]], a Polish version was screened, named ''Dziupla Cezara''.\n\n==Theme music score==\nStar of the show [[Richard O'Sullivan]] wrote the theme music for the programme, which was arranged and performed by [[The Shadows]]'s [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]].\n\n==DVD releases==\nAll six series of ''Robin's Nest'' have been released on DVD in the UK (Region 2). \n\nAll six series have also been released on DVD in Australia (Region 4). Series One and Two on 2 April 2009. After a lengthy delay Series Three was released on 3 October 2012, Series Four on 6 March 2013 and Series Five and Six on 4 September 2013.\n\nIn 2019 a 19-disc box set was released by Network/Fremantle containing every episode of Robin's Nest, George & Mildred and Man About The House. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
