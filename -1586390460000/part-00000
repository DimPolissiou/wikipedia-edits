The popular song \"[[Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee]]\" was introduced in the musical by [[J.

In the show-within-the-show, Rodney St. Clair sings \"My Beautiful Rhinestone Girl\".  However, when risqu\u00e9 material is added the show is raided and the government tries to close it.

Thus, it may suggest the region of Samaria is named after the Samaritans, rather than the Samaritans being named after the region. In Jewish tradition, however, it is sometimes claimed that Mount Samaria, meaning \"Watch Mountain\", is actually named so because watchers used to watch from those mountains for approaching armies from Egypt in ancient times.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In [[Modern Hebrew]], the Samaritans are called {{lang-he|{{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}|Shomronim}}, which would appear to simply mean \"inhabitants of Samaria\".

The reference to Mount Gerizim derives from the biblical story of Moses ordering Joshua to take the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] to the mountains by Shekhem ([[Nablus]]) and place half of the tribes, six in number, on Mount Gerizim, the Mount of the Blessing, and the other half on [[Mount Ebal]], the Mount of the Curse. The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33).\n\nSamaritans claim they are Israelite descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], who survived the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]] by the [[Assyria]]ns in 722 BCE.\n\nSamaritan historiography places the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the tribes of Israel conquered and returned to the land of [[Canaan]], led by Joshua. In its account, after Joshua's death, [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] the priest left the Tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim and built another one under his own rule in the hills of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]].\n\n[[Abu l-Fath]], who in the 14th century wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:<ref>''The Keepers, An Introduction to the History and Culture of the Samaritans'', by Robert T. Anderson and Terry Giles, Hendrickson Publishing, 2002, pages 11\u201312</ref>\n\n{{quote|A terrible civil war broke out between Eli son of Yafni, of the line of Ithamar, and the sons of Pincus ([[Phinehas]]), because Eli son of Yafni resolved to usurp the High Priesthood from the descendants of Pincus. He used to offer sacrifices on an altar of stones. He was 50 years old, endowed with wealth and in charge of the treasury of the Children of Israel. ...\n\nHe offered a sacrifice on the altar, but without salt, as if he were inattentive. When the Great High Priest Ozzi learned of this, and found the sacrifice was not accepted, he thoroughly disowned him; and it is (even) said that he rebuked him.\n\nThereupon he and the group that sympathized with him, rose in revolt and at once he and his followers and his beasts set off for Shiloh. Thus Israel split in factions. He sent to their leaders saying to them, ''Anyone who would like to see wonderful things, let him come to me.'' Then he assembled a large group around him in Shiloh, and built a Temple for himself there; he constructed a place like the Temple (on [[Mount Gerizim]]). He built an altar, omitting no detail\u2014it all corresponded to the original, piece by piece.\n\nAt this time the Children of Israel split into three factions. A loyal faction on [[Mount Gerizim]]; a heretical faction that followed false gods; and the faction that followed Eli son of Yafni in Shiloh.}}\n\nFurther, the ''Samaritan Chronicle Adler'', or New Chronicle, believed to have been composed in the 18th century using earlier chronicles as sources states:\n\n{{quote|And the Children of Israel in his days divided into three groups.

These are the Samaritans (shamray).</poem></blockquote>\n\n[[Adam Zertal|Zertal]] dates the Assyrian onslaught at 721 BCE to 647 BCE and discusses three waves of imported settlers. He shows that Mesopotamian pottery in Samaritan territory cluster around the lands of Menasheh and that the type of pottery found was produced around 689 BCE. Some date their split with the Jews to the time of [[Nehemiah]], [[Ezra]], and the building of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Returning exiles considered the Samaritans to be non-Israelites and, thus, not fit for this religious work.\n\nThe ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (under \"Samaritans\") summarizes both past and present views on the Samaritans' origins. It says:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=\"Samaritans\" in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 1972, Volume 14, col. 727.|Until the middle of the 20th century it was customary to believe that the Samaritans originated from a mixture of the people living in Samaria and other peoples at the time of the conquest of Samaria by Assyria (722\u2013721 BCE). The biblical account in II Kings 17 had long been the decisive source for the formulation of historical accounts of Samaritan origins. Reconsideration of this passage, however, has led to more attention being paid to the Chronicles of the Samaritans themselves. With the publication of Chronicle II (Sefer ha-Yamim), the fullest Samaritan version of their own history became available: the chronicles, and a variety of non-Samaritan materials.\n\nAccording to the former, the Samaritans are the direct descendants of the Joseph tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, and until the 17th century CE they possessed a high priesthood descending directly from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas. They claim to have continuously occupied their ancient territory and to have been at peace with other Israelite tribes until the time when Eli disrupted the Northern cult by moving from Shechem to Shiloh and attracting some northern Israelites to his new followers there. For the Samaritans, this was the \"schism\" par excellence.}}\n\nFurthermore, to this day the Samaritans claim descent from the tribe of Joseph:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=J. A. Montgomery, ''The Samaritans, the Earliest Jewish Sect: Their History, Theology and Literature'', 1907, p. 32|The laymen also possess their traditional claims. They are all of the tribe of Joseph, except those of the tribe of Benjamin, but this traditional branch of people, which, the Chronicles assert, was established at Gaza in earlier days, seems to have disappeared. There exists an aristocratic feeling amongst the different families in this community, and some are very proud over their pedigree and the great men it had produced.}}\n\n===Dead Sea scrolls===\nThe [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea scroll]] 4Q372 hopes that the northern tribes will return to the land of Joseph. The current dwellers in the north are referred to as fools, an enemy people. However, they are not referred to as foreigners.

At one point, it is simply said that they were from Arabia, while at another, that they were brought from a number of countries conquered by Sargon II:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=Sargon II Inscriptions, COS{{unverifiable|reason=What exactly is COS?|date=January 2017}} 2.118A, p. 293|the Samarians who had agreed with a hostile king ...I fought with them and decisively defeated them...carried off as spoil. 50 chariots for my royal force...the rest of them I settled in the midst of Assyria. ...The Tamudi, Ibadidi, Marsimani and Hayappa, who live in distant Arabia, in the desert, who knew neither overseer nor commander, who never brought tribute to any king--with the help of Ashshur my lord, I defeated them.

They were temporarily united in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]], but after the death of Solomon, the kingdom split in two, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] with its last capital city [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] with its capital [[Jerusalem]].\n\nThe [[Deuteronomistic history]], written in Judah, portrayed Israel as a sinful kingdom, divinely punished for its idolatry and iniquity by being destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BCE.\n\nThe tensions continued in the postexilic period. The [[Books of Kings]] are more inclusive than [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]] since the ideal is of one Israel with twelve tribes, whereas the [[Books of Chronicles]] concentrate on the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and ignore the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]].<ref>Michael D. Coogan, \"A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament\" page 363, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Bechtel |first=Florentine |year=1911|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11472a.htm |title=The Books of Paralimpomenon (Chronicles)}}</ref>\n\nThe Samaritans claimed that they were the true Israel who were descendants of the \"[[Ten Lost Tribes]]\" taken into Assyrian captivity. They had their own sacred precinct on [[Mount Gerizim]] and claimed that it was the original sanctuary. Moreover, they claimed that their version of the Pentateuch was the original and that the Jews had a falsified text produced by [[Ezra]] during the Babylonian exile.\n\nBoth Jewish and Samaritan religious leaders taught that it was wrong to have any contact with the opposite group, and neither was to enter each other's territories or even to speak to one another. During the [[New Testament]] period, the tensions were exploited by Roman authorities as they likewise had done between rival tribal factions elsewhere, and [[Josephus]] reports numerous violent confrontations between Jews and Samaritans throughout the first half of the first century.<ref>Mark A.

From a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].]]\n\nAccording to historian [[Lawrence Schiffman]], throughout the Persian Period, Judeans and Samaritans fought periodically with one another. The Samaritans were a blend of all kinds of people\u2014made up of Israelites who were not exiled when the Northern Kingdom was destroyed in 722 BCE\u2014of various different nationalities whom the Assyrians had resettled in the area. The Assyrians did this as an attempt to ensure that Israel\u2019s national dream could not come true.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|last=Schiffman|first=Lawrence H.|publisher=Ktav Publishing House|year=1991|isbn=|location=NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Jewish version of events, when the Judean exile ended in 539 BCE and the exiles began returning home from Babylon, Samaritans found their former homeland of the north populated by other people who claimed the land as their own and Jerusalem, their former glorious capital, in ruins. The inhabitants worshiped the [[Paganism|Pagan gods]], but when the then-sparsely populated areas became infested with dangerous wild beasts, they appealed to the king of Assyria for Israelite priests to instruct them on how to worship the \"God of that country.\" The result was a syncretistic religion, in which national groups worshiped the Israelite God, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.\n\nAccording to Chronicles 36:22\u201323, the Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]] (reigned 559\u2013530 BCE), permitted the return of the exiles to their homeland and ordered the [[Second Temple|rebuilding of the Temple]] ([[Zion]]). The prophet Isaiah identified Cyrus as \"the Lord's [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]\".<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|45:1|HE}}</ref> The word \"Messiah\" refers to an anointed individual, such as a king or priest.\n\nDuring the First Temple, it was possible for foreigners to help the Jewish people in an informal way until tension grew between the Samaritans and Judeans. This meant that foreigners could physically move into Judean land and abide by its laws and religion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEzra 4 says that the local inhabitants of the land offered to assist with the building of the new Temple during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], but their offer was rejected. According to Ezra, this rejection precipitated a further interference not only with the rebuilding of the Temple but also with the reconstruction of Jerusalem.<ref name=\":0\" /> The issue surrounding the Samaritans offer to help rebuild the temple was a complicated one that took a while for the Judeans to think over. There had always been a division between the north and the south and this instance perfectly illustrates that. Following Solomon's death, sectionalism formed and inevitably led to the division of the kingdom.<ref name=\":0\" /> This division lead to the Judeans rejecting the offer made by the Samaritans to centralise worship at the Temple.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe text is not clear on this matter, but one possibility is that these \"people of the land\" were thought of as Samaritans. We do know that Samaritan and Jewish alienation increased and that the Samaritans eventually built their own temple on Mount Gerizim, near [[Shechem]].\n\nThe rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem took several decades. The project was first led by [[Zerubbabel#Sheshbazzar|Sheshbazzar]] (ca.&nbsp;538 BCE), later by Zerubbabel and [[Joshua the High Priest|Jeshua]], and later still by [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] (520\u2013515 BCE). The work was completed in 515 BCE.\n\nThe term \"Kuthim\" applied by Jews to the Samaritans had clear [[pejorative]] connotations, implying that they were interlopers brought in from [[Kutha]] in Mesopotamia and rejecting their claim of descent from the ancient Tribes of Israel.\n\nAccording to many scholars, archaeological excavations at Mount Gerizim indicate that a Samaritan temple was built there in the first half of the 5th century BCE.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=6NsxZRnxE70C&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=Lipschits+Yehud#v=onepage&q=Lipschits%20Yehud&f=false |first=Yitzhak |last=Magen |chapter=The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim in the Light of the Archaeological Evidence |editor1=Oded Lipschitz|editor2=Gary N.

His policy was to [[Hellenization|Hellenize]] his entire kingdom and standardize religious observance. According to 1 Maccabees 1:41-50 he proclaimed himself the incarnation of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Zeus]] and mandated death to anyone who refused to worship him. In the 2nd century BCE, a series of events led to a revolution by a faction of Judeans against Antiochus IV.\n\nThe universal peril led the Samaritans, eager for safety, to repudiate all connection and kinship with the Jews. The request was granted. This was put forth as the final breach between the two groups, being alleged at a much later date in the Christian Bible (John 4:9), \"For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans\"<ref>{{bibleref|John|4:9;27|9}}</ref>\u2014or not \"alleged\" if the Greek sunchrasthai merely refers to not sharing utensils (NABRE).\n\nAnderson notes that during the reign of Antiochus IV (175\u2013164 BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/282-jesus-and-the-samaritan-woman |title=Jesus and the Samaritan Woman / A Samaritan Woman Approaches:1 |publisher=Christiancourier.com |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=Bromiley, 4.304|the Samaritan temple was renamed either Zeus Hellenios (willingly by the Samaritans according to Josephus) or, more likely, Zeus Xenios, (unwillingly in accord with 2 Macc. 6:2).}}\n\nJosephus Book 12, Chapter 5 quotes the Samaritans as saying:\n{{quote|sign=|source=Josephus|We therefore beseech thee, our benefactor and saviour, to give order to Apolonius, the governor of this part of the country, and to Nicanor, the procurator of thy affairs, to give us no disturbances, nor to lay to our charge what the Jews are accused for, since we are aliens from their nation and from their customs, but let our temple which at present hath no name at all, be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.}}\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=II Maccabees 6:1\u20132|Shortly afterwards, the Greek king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews of Israel to violate their ancestral customs and live no longer by the laws of God; and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on [[Mount Gerizim]] to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.}}\n\n====Hasmonean influence====\nDuring the [[Hellenistic period]], Samaria was largely divided between a Hellenizing faction based in Samaria (Sebastaea) and a pious faction in Shekhem and surrounding rural areas, led by the High Priest. Samaria was a largely autonomous state nominally dependent on the [[Seleucid Empire]] until around 113 BCE, when the Jewish [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean ruler]] John Hyrcanus destroyed the Samaritan temple and devastated Samaria.\n\nThe Hellinized Samaritan Temple at Mount Gerizim was destroyed by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 113 BC, having existed about 200 years.

In the latter, it is only the Samaritan who helped the man stripped of clothing, beaten, and left on the road half dead, his Abrahamic covenantal circumcision implicitly evident. The priest and Levite walked past. But the Samaritan helped the naked man regardless of his nakedness (itself religiously offensive to the priest and Levite<ref>{{Cite web |title=Topical Bible: Nakedness |url=http://biblehub.com/topical/n/nakedness.htm |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=24 June 2017}}</ref>), his self-evident poverty, or to which Hebrew sect he belonged.\n\nThe Temple of Gerizim was rebuilt after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Romans, around 136 CE.

The Emperor went to Neapolis ([[Shechem]]), gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and re-built the synagogue as a church. Zeno then took for himself [[Mount Gerizim]], where the Samaritans worshiped God, and built several edifices, among whom a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshiping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Sichem, burned five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut the finger of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating the ceremony of [[Pentecost]]. They elected a [[Justa (rebel)|Justa]] (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to [[Caesarea]], where a noteworthy Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to [[John Malalas]], the ''dux Palaestinae'' Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based Arcadiani of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him and sent his head to Zeno.<ref>Malalas, 15.</ref> According to [[Procopius]], Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.<ref>Procopius, ''Buildings'', 5.7.</ref>\n\nSome modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of St. Procopius in Neapolis (Sichem) and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signalling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.<ref>Alan David Crown, ''The Samaritans'', Mohr Siebeck, 1989, {{ISBN|3-16-145237-2}}, pp. 72-73.</ref>\n\nUnder a [[charismatic authority|charismatic]], [[Messiah#Messianic figure|messianic figure]] named [[Julianus ben Sabar]] (or ben Sahir), the Samaritans launched a war to create their own independent state in 529. With the help of the [[Ghassanids]], Emperor [[Justinian I]] crushed the revolt; tens of thousands of Samaritans died or were [[slavery|enslaved]]. The Samaritan faith, which had previously enjoyed the status of ''[[religio licita]]'', was virtually outlawed thereafter by the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]]; from a population once at least in the hundreds of thousands, the Samaritan community dwindled to tens of thousands.\n[[File:Mosaic from Samaritan synagogue.jpg|thumb|Mosaic from Samaritan synagogue ([[Israel Museum]])]]\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThough initially guaranteed religious freedom after the Muslim conquest of Palestine, Samaritan numbers dropped further as a result of massacres and conversions.<ref>Pummer 1987 p.4.</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[early Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]], apart from [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], small dispersed communities of Samaritans were living also in [[History of Muslim Egypt|Arab Egypt]], [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], and [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]]. Like other non-Muslims in the empire, such as Jews, Samaritans were often considered to be [[People of the Book]]. Their minority status was protected by the Muslim rulers, and they had the right to practice their religion, but, as [[dhimmi]], adult males had to pay the [[jizya]] or \"protection tax\". This however changed during late Abbasid period, with increasing persecution targeting the Samaritan community and considering them infidels which must convert to Islam. The tradition of men wearing a red [[tarboosh]] may go back to an order by the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861 CE) that required non-Muslims to be distinguished from Muslims.<ref name =\"Pummer\">Reinhard Pummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VOLOfJ6PgAMC&pg=PA17 ''The Samaritans,''] BRILL, 1987 p.17.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Crusades]], Samaritans, like the non-Latin Christian inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], were second-class citizens, but they were tolerated and perhaps favored because they were docile and had been mentioned positively in the Christian New Testament.<ref>Benjamin Z.

While the Samaritan communities in both the West Bank's Nablus and Israeli Holon have assimilated to the surrounding respective cultures, Hebrew has become the primary domestic language for Samaritans. Samaritans who are Israeli citizens are drafted into the military, along with the Jewish citizens of Israel.\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Samaritans praying during Passover holiday ceremony on mount Grizim.jpg|thumb|Samaritans celebrating Passover on Mount Grizim in the West Bank]]\nRelations of Samaritans with Jewish Israelis and Muslim and Christian Palestinians in neighboring areas have been mixed. Samaritans living in both Israel and in the West Bank enjoy Israeli [[citizenship]]. Samaritans in the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]-ruled territories are a minority in the midst of a Muslim majority. They had a reserved seat in the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the [[1996 Palestinian general election|election of 1996]], but they no longer have one. Samaritans living in Samaria have been granted [[passport]]s by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n\n===Community survival===\n{{see also|Cousin marriage in the Middle East}}\nOne of the biggest problems facing the community today is the issue of continuity. With such a small population, divided into only four families ([[Kohen|Cohen]], Tsedakah, Danafi, and Marhiv, with the Matar family dying out in 1968)<ref> Israelite Samaritan Families Today, Benyamin Tsedakah https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/about-israelite-samaritans/families/?amp</ref><ref>The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage, Monika Schreiber https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4We7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=samaritan+%22matar%22+family&source=bl&ots=H6ZTZVMMP1&sig=ACfU3U2g7k2OtSoeFpTAX10PVRPpbwu9rQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC8afV4cXmAhV2QEEAHQU3CdMQ6AEwAnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=samaritan%20%22matar%22%20family&f=false</ref> and a general refusal to accept converts, there has been a history of [[genetic disorder]]s within the group due to the small [[gene pool]]. To counter this, the Samaritan community has recently agreed that men from the community marry non-Samaritan (primarily, Israeli Jewish) women, provided that the women agree to follow Samaritan religious practices. There is a six-month trial period before officially joining the Samaritan community to see whether this is a commitment that the woman would like to take. This often poses a problem for the women, who are typically less than eager to adopt the strict interpretation of biblical (Levitical) laws regarding [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]], by which they must live in a separate dwelling during their periods and after [[childbirth]]. There have been a few instances of [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. In addition, all marriages within the Samaritan community are first approved by a [[geneticist]] at [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel HaShomer Hospital]], in order to prevent the spread of genetic disorders. In meetings arranged by \"[[mail-order bride|international marriage agencies]]\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Ancient community seeks brides abroad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6333475.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=6 February 2007}}</ref> a small number of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] women have recently been allowed to marry into the community in an effort to expand the gene pool.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2013/01/20131873534572211.html|title=West Bank Samaritans fight extinction|last=Ferguson|first=Jane|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=8 January 2013|location=Mount Gerizin}}</ref>\n\nThe Samaritan community in Israel also faces demographic challenges as some young people leave the community and convert to Judaism.

The current high priest is [[Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach]] who assumed the office in 2013.\n\n===Samaritan origins of Palestinian Muslims in Nablus===\nMuch of the local [[Palestinians|Palestinian population]] of [[Nablus]] is believed to be descended from Samaritans, who had converted to Islam.<ref name=Ireton/> According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution under various Muslim rulers, and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.<ref name=Ireton>{{cite web|title=The Samaritans - The Samaritans: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm}}</ref> The Samaritans themselves describe the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]] as the worst period in their modern history, as many Samaritan families were forced to convert to Islam during that time.<ref name=\"Yaish\">[http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&cat=18 The Political History of the Samaritans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035811/http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&cat=18 |date=2012-01-19 }} - zajel / An-Najah National University, January 24, 2005</ref> Even today, certain Nabulsi family names such as Maslamani, Yaish, and Shaksheer among others, are associated with Samaritan ancestry.<ref name=Ireton/>\n\nFor the Samaritans in particular, the passing of the [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] Edict by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in 1021, under which all Jews and Christians in the Fatimid ruled southern [[Levant]] were ordered to either convert to Islam or leave, along with another notable forced conversion to Islam imposed at the hands of the rebel ibn Fir\u0101sa,<ref name=\"autogenerated257\"/><ref name=\"Fattal, A. 1958 p. 72-73\"/> would contribute to their rapid unprecedented decrease, and ultimately almost complete extinction as a separate religious community.

Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.\n\n===Samaritan Temple===\nAccording to Samaritans,<ref>http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614010749/http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm |date=June 14, 2008 }}</ref> it was on [[Mount Gerizim]] that Abraham was commanded by God to offer Isaac, his son, as a sacrifice.<ref>{{Bibleref|Genesis|22:2|9}}</ref> In both narratives, God then causes the sacrifice to be interrupted, explaining that this was the ultimate test of Abraham's obedience, as a result of which all the world would receive blessing.\n\n[[File:Harry Fenn. Ruins on the summit of Mount Gerizim, on the site of the Samaritan temple. 1881-1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins on Mount Gerizim c. 1880.]]\n\nThe Torah mentions the place where God chooses to establish His name (Deut 12:5), and Judaism takes this to refer to Jerusalem. However, the Samaritan text speaks of the place where God ''has chosen'' to establish His name, and Samaritans identify it as Mount Gerizim, making it the focus of their spiritual values.\n\nThe legitimacy of the Samaritan temple was attacked by Jewish scholars including [[Andronicus ben Meshullam]].\n\nIn the Christian Bible, the [[Gospel of John]] relates an [[Samaritan woman at the well|encounter]] between a Samaritan woman and [[Jesus]] in which she says that the mountain was the center of their worship. She poses the question to Jesus when she realizes that he is the Messiah. Jesus affirms the Jewish position, saying \"You (that is, the Samaritans) worship what you do not know\".<ref>{{Bibleref|John|4:22|9}}</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\n* There is one [[God]], [[Yahweh|YHWH]], the same God recognized by the [[prophet#The Hebrew and Jewish concepts of prophet|Hebrew prophets]].\n* The [[Torah]] was given by God to [[Moses]].\n* [[Mount Gerizim]], not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by Israel's God.\n* Many Samaritans believe that at the end of days, the dead will be [[resurrection|resurrected]] by the Taheb, a restorer (possibly a prophet, some say Moses).\n* Resurrection and Paradise.\n* The priests are the interpreters of the law and the keepers of tradition; scholars are secondary to the priesthood.\n* The authority of post-Torah sections of the Tanakh, and classical Jewish [[Rabbi]]nical works (the [[Talmud]], comprising the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Gemara]]) is rejected.\n* They have a [[Ten Commandments#Samaritan|significantly different version]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] (for example, their 10th commandment is about the sanctity of Mount Gerizim).\n\nThe Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the [[Samaritan alphabet|Ancient Hebrew script]], a [[High Priest of Israel|High Priesthood]], the slaughtering and eating of [[Lamb and mutton|lambs]] on [[Passover]] eve, and the celebration of the first month's beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru`ah (the biblical name for \"[[Rosh Hashanah]]\"), at the beginning of [[Tishrei]], is not considered a [[New Year]] as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] differs from the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]] as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is \"the place that God ''has chosen''\" to establish His name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to \"the place that God ''chooses''\". Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Samaritans.jpg|Samaritans, from a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].\nFile:2106 WLM - OVEDC - Mount Gerizim - SUKUT 15.jpg|Sukkot on Mount Gerizim\nFile:Bitknest2.jpg|Entrance to a modern Samaritan synagogue in the city of [[Holon]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n===Relationship to Rabbinic Judaism===\n[[File:Samaritan doorpost.jpg|thumb|upright|The Samaritan [[mezuzah]] engraved above the front door]]\n\nSamaritans refer to themselves as ''Benai Yisrael'' (\"[[Children of Israel]]\") which is a term used by all Jewish denominations as a name for the Jewish people as a whole. They, however, do not refer to themselves as ''Yehudim'' (Jews), the standard Hebrew name for Jews.\n\nThe Talmudic attitude expressed in [[Minor tractate|tractate Kutim]] is that they are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice coincides with Rabbinic Judaism but as non-Jews where their practice differs. Some claim that since the 19th century, Rabbinic Judaism has regarded the Samaritans as a Jewish sect and the term \"Samaritan Jews\" has been used for them.<ref>Shulamit Sela, ''The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title'', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 57, No. 2 (1994), pp. 255-267</ref>\n\n===Religious texts===\nSamaritan law is not the same as [[Halakha]] (Rabbinic Jewish law). The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:\n\n* '''[[Torah]]'''\n** ''[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]'': There are some 6,000 differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch text; and, according to one estimate, 1,900 points of agreement between it and the Greek LXX version. Several passages in the [[New Testament]] would also appear to echo a Torah textual tradition not dissimilar to that conserved in the Samaritan text. There are several theories regarding the similarities. The variations, some corroborated by readings in the Old Latin, Syriac and Ethiopian translations, attest to the antiquity of the Samaritan text.<ref>James VanderKam, Peter Flint, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&pg=PA95 ''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity,''] A&C Black, 2nd ed. 2005 p.95.</ref><ref>Timothy Michael Law, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZoeAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 ''When God Spoke Greek: The Septuagint and the Making of the Christian Bible,''] Oxford University Press, USA, 2013 p.24.</ref><ref>Isac Leo Seeligmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BHYnIhREtzgC&pg=PA64 ''The Septuagint Version of Isaiah and Cognate Studies,''] Mohr Siebeck 2004 pp.64ff.</ref>\n* '''Historical writings'''\n** ''[[Samaritan Chronicle, The Tolidah]]'' (Creation to the time of Abishah)\n** [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|''Samaritan Chronicle'', The Chronicle of Joshua]] (Israel during the time of divine favor) (4th century, in Arabic and Aramaic)\n** ''Samaritan Chronicle, Adler'' (Israel from the time of divine disfavor until the exile)\n* '''[[Hagiography|Hagiographical]] texts'''\n** ''Samaritan Halakhic Text'', The Hillukh (Code of Halakha, marriage, circumcision, etc.)\n** ''Samaritan Halakhic Text'', the Kitab at-Tabbah (Halakha and interpretation of some verses and chapters from the Torah, written by Abu Al Hassan 12th century CE)\n** ''Samaritan Halakhic Text'', the Kitab al-Kafi (Book of Halakha, written by Yosef Al Ascar 14th century CE)\n** ''Al-Asatir''\u2014legendary Aramaic texts from the 11th and 12th centuries, containing:\n*** ''Haggadic Midrash'', Abu'l Hasan al-Suri\n*** ''Haggadic Midrash'', Memar Markah\u20143rd or 4th century theological treatises attributed to ''Hakkam'' Markha\n*** ''Haggadic Midrash'', Pinkhas on the Taheb\n*** ''Haggadic Midrash'', Molad Maseh (On the birth of Moses)\n* ''Defter'', prayer book of psalms and hymns.<ref>''Samaritan Documents, Relating To Their History, Religion and Life'', translated and edited by John Bowman, Pittsburgh Original Texts & Translations Series Number 2, 1977.</ref>\n* ''Samaritan Haggadah''<ref>\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05df \u05d4\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 : \u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7, \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d7 \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 (Samaritan Haggada & Pessah Passover / Zeva\u1e25 \u1e33orban ha-Pesa\u1e25 : Hagadah shel Pesa\u1e25, nusa\u1e25 Shomroni = Samaritan Haggada & Pessah Passover), Avraham Nur Tseda\u1e33ah, Tel Aviv, 1958</ref>\n\n==Christian sources: New Testament==\nSamaria or Samaritans are mentioned in the [[New Testament]] books of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]] and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]].

This has accompanied controversy over whether the Samaritans are named after the geographic area of Samaria (the northern part of what is now globally known as the West Bank), or whether the area received its name from the group. This distinction is controversial in part because different interpretations can be used to justify or deny claims of ancestry over this region, which has been deeply contested in modern times.\n\nIn [[Samaritan Hebrew]], the Samaritans call themselves \"Shamerim\" (\u05e9\u05b7\u05de\u05b6\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd), which according to the Anchor Bible Dictionary, is derived from the Ancient Hebrew term meaning \"Guardians/Keepers/Watchers [of the [[Torah]]/Law]\".<ref>David Noel Freedman, ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', 5:941 (New York: Doubleday, 1996, c1992).</ref>\n\n[[Biblical Hebrew]] ''\u0160omerim''<ref>{{cite web|title=Biblical Hebrew Lexicon entry#SMRI|url=http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8104&t=KJV|work=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=King James Version|author=Gesenius Biblical Hebrew Dictionary}}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646|al-S\u0101miriyy\u016bn}})<ref name=\"Manzur\">{{cite book|author=Ibn Manzur|authorlink=Ibn Manzur|title=Lisan al Arab|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EY5QAAAACAAJ|volume=21|publisher=Al-dar al-Misriya li-l-talif wa-l-taryamar|isbn=978-0-86685-541-9|chapter=entry SMR|year=1979}}</ref> \"Guardians\" (singular ''\u0160omer'') comes from the Hebrew [[Semitic root]] \u05e9\u05de\u05e8, which means \"to watch, guard\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Gessinius Lexicon Hebrew entry#H8104|url=http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8104&t=KJV|work=Hebrew|publisher=Blue Letter Bible}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, Samaria was the key geographical concentration of the Samaritan community. Thus, it may suggest the region of Samaria is named after the Samaritans, rather than the Samaritans being named after the region. In Jewish tradition, however, it is sometimes claimed that Mount Samaria, meaning \"Watch Mountain\", is actually named so because watchers used to watch from those mountains for approaching armies from Egypt in ancient times.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In [[Modern Hebrew]], the Samaritans are called {{lang-he|{{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}|Shomronim}}, which would appear to simply mean \"inhabitants of Samaria\". This is a politically sensitive distinction.\n\nThat the etymology of the Samaritans' [[ethnonym]] in Samaritan Hebrew is derived from \"Guardians/Keepers/Watchers [of the Law/Torah]\", as opposed to Samaritans being named after the region of Samaria, has in history been supported by a number of Christian Church fathers, including [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the ''[[Panarion]]'', [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]] in the ''[[Chronicon]]'' and [[Origen]] in ''The Commentary on Saint John's Gospel'', and in some [[Talmud]]ic commentary of [[Tanhuma]] on Genesis 31, and [[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 38, p.&nbsp;21.<ref name=\"Pummer2002\">{{cite book|author=Reinhard Pummer|title=Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism: Texts, Translations and Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhDlzh--Q2AC&pg=PA123|year=2002|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-147831-4|pages=123, 42, 156}}</ref><ref name=\"Coggins1975\">{{cite book|author=R.

The reference to Mount Gerizim derives from the biblical story of Moses ordering Joshua to take the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] to the mountains by Shekhem ([[Nablus]]) and place half of the tribes, six in number, on Mount Gerizim, the Mount of the Blessing, and the other half on [[Mount Ebal]], the Mount of the Curse. The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33).\n\nSamaritans claim they are Israelite descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], who survived the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]] by the [[Assyria]]ns in 722 BCE.\n\nSamaritan historiography places the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the tribes of Israel conquered and returned to the land of [[Canaan]], led by Joshua. In its account, after Joshua's death, [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] the priest left the Tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim and built another one under his own rule in the hills of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]].\n\n[[Abu l-Fath]], who in the 14th century wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:<ref>''The Keepers, An Introduction to the History and Culture of the Samaritans'', by Robert T.

He was 50 years old, endowed with wealth and in charge of the treasury of the Children of Israel. ...\n\nHe offered a sacrifice on the altar, but without salt, as if he were inattentive. When the Great High Priest Ozzi learned of this, and found the sacrifice was not accepted, he thoroughly disowned him; and it is (even) said that he rebuked him.\n\nThereupon he and the group that sympathized with him, rose in revolt and at once he and his followers and his beasts set off for Shiloh. Thus Israel split in factions. He sent to their leaders saying to them, ''Anyone who would like to see wonderful things, let him come to me.'' Then he assembled a large group around him in Shiloh, and built a Temple for himself there; he constructed a place like the Temple (on [[Mount Gerizim]]).

These are the Samaritans (shamray).</poem></blockquote>\n\n[[Adam Zertal|Zertal]] dates the Assyrian onslaught at 721 BCE to 647 BCE and discusses three waves of imported settlers. He shows that Mesopotamian pottery in Samaritan territory cluster around the lands of Menasheh and that the type of pottery found was produced around 689 BCE. Some date their split with the Jews to the time of [[Nehemiah]], [[Ezra]], and the building of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Returning exiles considered the Samaritans to be non-Israelites and, thus, not fit for this religious work.\n\nThe ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (under \"Samaritans\") summarizes both past and present views on the Samaritans' origins. It says:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=\"Samaritans\" in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 1972, Volume 14, col. 727.|Until the middle of the 20th century it was customary to believe that the Samaritans originated from a mixture of the people living in Samaria and other peoples at the time of the conquest of Samaria by Assyria (722\u2013721 BCE). The biblical account in II Kings 17 had long been the decisive source for the formulation of historical accounts of Samaritan origins. Reconsideration of this passage, however, has led to more attention being paid to the Chronicles of the Samaritans themselves. With the publication of Chronicle II (Sefer ha-Yamim), the fullest Samaritan version of their own history became available: the chronicles, and a variety of non-Samaritan materials.\n\nAccording to the former, the Samaritans are the direct descendants of the Joseph tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, and until the 17th century CE they possessed a high priesthood descending directly from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas. They claim to have continuously occupied their ancient territory and to have been at peace with other Israelite tribes until the time when Eli disrupted the Northern cult by moving from Shechem to Shiloh and attracting some northern Israelites to his new followers there. For the Samaritans, this was the \"schism\" par excellence.}}\n\nFurthermore, to this day the Samaritans claim descent from the tribe of Joseph:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=J. A. Montgomery, ''The Samaritans, the Earliest Jewish Sect: Their History, Theology and Literature'', 1907, p. 32|The laymen also possess their traditional claims.

At one point, it is simply said that they were from Arabia, while at another, that they were brought from a number of countries conquered by Sargon II:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=Sargon II Inscriptions, COS{{unverifiable|reason=What exactly is COS?|date=January 2017}} 2.118A, p. 293|the Samarians who had agreed with a hostile king ...I fought with them and decisively defeated them...carried off as spoil. 50 chariots for my royal force...the rest of them I settled in the midst of Assyria. ...The Tamudi, Ibadidi, Marsimani and Hayappa, who live in distant Arabia, in the desert, who knew neither overseer nor commander, who never brought tribute to any king--with the help of Ashshur my lord, I defeated them.

They were temporarily united in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]], but after the death of Solomon, the kingdom split in two, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] with its last capital city [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] with its capital [[Jerusalem]].\n\nThe [[Deuteronomistic history]], written in Judah, portrayed Israel as a sinful kingdom, divinely punished for its idolatry and iniquity by being destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BCE.\n\nThe tensions continued in the postexilic period. The [[Books of Kings]] are more inclusive than [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]] since the ideal is of one Israel with twelve tribes, whereas the [[Books of Chronicles]] concentrate on the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and ignore the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]].<ref>Michael D. Coogan, \"A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament\" page 363, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Bechtel |first=Florentine |year=1911|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11472a.htm |title=The Books of Paralimpomenon (Chronicles)}}</ref>\n\nThe Samaritans claimed that they were the true Israel who were descendants of the \"[[Ten Lost Tribes]]\" taken into Assyrian captivity. They had their own sacred precinct on [[Mount Gerizim]] and claimed that it was the original sanctuary. Moreover, they claimed that their version of the Pentateuch was the original and that the Jews had a falsified text produced by [[Ezra]] during the Babylonian exile.\n\nBoth Jewish and Samaritan religious leaders taught that it was wrong to have any contact with the opposite group, and neither was to enter each other's territories or even to speak to one another. During the [[New Testament]] period, the tensions were exploited by Roman authorities as they likewise had done between rival tribal factions elsewhere, and [[Josephus]] reports numerous violent confrontations between Jews and Samaritans throughout the first half of the first century.<ref>Mark A.

From a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].]]\n\nAccording to historian [[Lawrence Schiffman]], throughout the Persian Period, Judeans and Samaritans fought periodically with one another. The Samaritans were a blend of all kinds of people\u2014made up of Israelites who were not exiled when the Northern Kingdom was destroyed in 722 BCE\u2014of various different nationalities whom the Assyrians had resettled in the area. The Assyrians did this as an attempt to ensure that Israel\u2019s national dream could not come true.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|last=Schiffman|first=Lawrence H.|publisher=Ktav Publishing House|year=1991|isbn=|location=NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Jewish version of events, when the Judean exile ended in 539 BCE and the exiles began returning home from Babylon, Samaritans found their former homeland of the north populated by other people who claimed the land as their own and Jerusalem, their former glorious capital, in ruins. The inhabitants worshiped the [[Paganism|Pagan gods]], but when the then-sparsely populated areas became infested with dangerous wild beasts, they appealed to the king of Assyria for Israelite priests to instruct them on how to worship the \"God of that country.\" The result was a syncretistic religion, in which national groups worshiped the Israelite God, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.\n\nAccording to Chronicles 36:22\u201323, the Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]] (reigned 559\u2013530 BCE), permitted the return of the exiles to their homeland and ordered the [[Second Temple|rebuilding of the Temple]] ([[Zion]]). The prophet Isaiah identified Cyrus as \"the Lord's [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]\".<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|45:1|HE}}</ref> The word \"Messiah\" refers to an anointed individual, such as a king or priest.\n\nDuring the First Temple, it was possible for foreigners to help the Jewish people in an informal way until tension grew between the Samaritans and Judeans. This meant that foreigners could physically move into Judean land and abide by its laws and religion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEzra 4 says that the local inhabitants of the land offered to assist with the building of the new Temple during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], but their offer was rejected. According to Ezra, this rejection precipitated a further interference not only with the rebuilding of the Temple but also with the reconstruction of Jerusalem.<ref name=\":0\" /> The issue surrounding the Samaritans offer to help rebuild the temple was a complicated one that took a while for the Judeans to think over. There had always been a division between the north and the south and this instance perfectly illustrates that. Following Solomon's death, sectionalism formed and inevitably led to the division of the kingdom.<ref name=\":0\" /> This division lead to the Judeans rejecting the offer made by the Samaritans to centralise worship at the Temple.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe text is not clear on this matter, but one possibility is that these \"people of the land\" were thought of as Samaritans. We do know that Samaritan and Jewish alienation increased and that the Samaritans eventually built their own temple on Mount Gerizim, near [[Shechem]].\n\nThe rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem took several decades. The project was first led by [[Zerubbabel#Sheshbazzar|Sheshbazzar]] (ca.&nbsp;538 BCE), later by Zerubbabel and [[Joshua the High Priest|Jeshua]], and later still by [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] (520\u2013515 BCE). The work was completed in 515 BCE.\n\nThe term \"Kuthim\" applied by Jews to the Samaritans had clear [[pejorative]] connotations, implying that they were interlopers brought in from [[Kutha]] in Mesopotamia and rejecting their claim of descent from the ancient Tribes of Israel.\n\nAccording to many scholars, archaeological excavations at Mount Gerizim indicate that a Samaritan temple was built there in the first half of the 5th century BCE.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=6NsxZRnxE70C&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=Lipschits+Yehud#v=onepage&q=Lipschits%20Yehud&f=false |first=Yitzhak |last=Magen |chapter=The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim in the Light of the Archaeological Evidence |editor1=Oded Lipschitz|editor2=Gary N.

His policy was to [[Hellenization|Hellenize]] his entire kingdom and standardize religious observance. According to 1 Maccabees 1:41-50 he proclaimed himself the incarnation of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Zeus]] and mandated death to anyone who refused to worship him. In the 2nd century BCE, a series of events led to a revolution by a faction of Judeans against Antiochus IV.\n\nThe universal peril led the Samaritans, eager for safety, to repudiate all connection and kinship with the Jews. The request was granted. This was put forth as the final breach between the two groups, being alleged at a much later date in the Christian Bible (John 4:9), \"For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans\"<ref>{{bibleref|John|4:9;27|9}}</ref>\u2014or not \"alleged\" if the Greek sunchrasthai merely refers to not sharing utensils (NABRE).\n\nAnderson notes that during the reign of Antiochus IV (175\u2013164 BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/282-jesus-and-the-samaritan-woman |title=Jesus and the Samaritan Woman / A Samaritan Woman Approaches:1 |publisher=Christiancourier.com |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=Bromiley, 4.304|the Samaritan temple was renamed either Zeus Hellenios (willingly by the Samaritans according to Josephus) or, more likely, Zeus Xenios, (unwillingly in accord with 2 Macc. 6:2).}}\n\nJosephus Book 12, Chapter 5 quotes the Samaritans as saying:\n{{quote|sign=|source=Josephus|We therefore beseech thee, our benefactor and saviour, to give order to Apolonius, the governor of this part of the country, and to Nicanor, the procurator of thy affairs, to give us no disturbances, nor to lay to our charge what the Jews are accused for, since we are aliens from their nation and from their customs, but let our temple which at present hath no name at all, be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.}}\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=II Maccabees 6:1\u20132|Shortly afterwards, the Greek king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews of Israel to violate their ancestral customs and live no longer by the laws of God; and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on [[Mount Gerizim]] to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.}}\n\n====Hasmonean influence====\nDuring the [[Hellenistic period]], Samaria was largely divided between a Hellenizing faction based in Samaria (Sebastaea) and a pious faction in Shekhem and surrounding rural areas, led by the High Priest. Samaria was a largely autonomous state nominally dependent on the [[Seleucid Empire]] until around 113 BCE, when the Jewish [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean ruler]] John Hyrcanus destroyed the Samaritan temple and devastated Samaria.\n\nThe Hellinized Samaritan Temple at Mount Gerizim was destroyed by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 113 BC, having existed about 200 years.

In the latter, it is only the Samaritan who helped the man stripped of clothing, beaten, and left on the road half dead, his Abrahamic covenantal circumcision implicitly evident. The priest and Levite walked past.

The Emperor went to Neapolis ([[Shechem]]), gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and re-built the synagogue as a church. Zeno then took for himself [[Mount Gerizim]], where the Samaritans worshiped God, and built several edifices, among whom a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshiping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Sichem, burned five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut the finger of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating the ceremony of [[Pentecost]]. They elected a [[Justa (rebel)|Justa]] (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to [[Caesarea]], where a noteworthy Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to [[John Malalas]], the ''dux Palaestinae'' Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based Arcadiani of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him and sent his head to Zeno.<ref>Malalas, 15.</ref> According to [[Procopius]], Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.<ref>Procopius, ''Buildings'', 5.7.</ref>\n\nSome modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489.

With the help of the [[Ghassanids]], Emperor [[Justinian I]] crushed the revolt; tens of thousands of Samaritans died or were [[slavery|enslaved]]. The Samaritan faith, which had previously enjoyed the status of ''[[religio licita]]'', was virtually outlawed thereafter by the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]]; from a population once at least in the hundreds of thousands, the Samaritan community dwindled to tens of thousands.\n[[File:Mosaic from Samaritan synagogue.jpg|thumb|Mosaic from Samaritan synagogue ([[Israel Museum]])]]\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThough initially guaranteed religious freedom after the Muslim conquest of Palestine, Samaritan numbers dropped further as a result of massacres and conversions.<ref>Pummer 1987 p.4.</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[early Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]], apart from [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], small dispersed communities of Samaritans were living also in [[History of Muslim Egypt|Arab Egypt]], [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], and [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]]. Like other non-Muslims in the empire, such as Jews, Samaritans were often considered to be [[People of the Book]]. Their minority status was protected by the Muslim rulers, and they had the right to practice their religion, but, as [[dhimmi]], adult males had to pay the [[jizya]] or \"protection tax\". This however changed during late Abbasid period, with increasing persecution targeting the Samaritan community and considering them infidels which must convert to Islam. The tradition of men wearing a red [[tarboosh]] may go back to an order by the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861 CE) that required non-Muslims to be distinguished from Muslims.<ref name =\"Pummer\">Reinhard Pummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VOLOfJ6PgAMC&pg=PA17 ''The Samaritans,''] BRILL, 1987 p.17.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Crusades]], Samaritans, like the non-Latin Christian inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], were second-class citizens, but they were tolerated and perhaps favored because they were docile and had been mentioned positively in the Christian New Testament.<ref>Benjamin Z.

In 1624, the last [[Samaritan High Priest]] of the line of [[Eleazar]] son of [[Aaron]] died without issue, but according to Samaritan tradition, descendants of Aaron's other son, [[Ithamar]], remained and took over the office.<ref name=Ireton/>\n\nBy the late Ottoman period, the Samaritan community dwindled to its lowest. In 19th century, with pressure of conversion and persecution from the local rulers and occasional natural disasters, the community fell to just over 100 persons.\n\n===British Mandate===\n[[File:The High Priest of the Samaritans with the Codex Nablus c. 192.jpg|thumb|upright|Yitzhaq ben Amram ben Shalma ben Tabia, the High Priest of the Samaritans, Nablus, c. 1920.]]\n[[File:Interior of the Synagogue of the Samaritans Nablus c. 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of the Synagogue of the Samaritans in Nablus, c. 1920.]]\nThe situation of the Samaritan community improved significantly during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. At that time, they began to work in the public sector, like many other groups.

By the late 1950s, around 100 Samaritans left the West Bank for Israel under an agreement with [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|the Jordanian authorities in the West Bank]].<ref name=\"Yaish\"/> In 1954, [[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] fostered a Samaritan enclave in Holon, Israel.\n\nUntil the 1990s, most of the Samaritans resided in the West Bank city of ([[Nablus]]) below [[Mount Gerizim]]. They relocated to the mountain itself near the [[Israel]]i settlement [[Har Brakha]] as a result of violence during the so-called \"[[First Intifada]]\" (1987\u20131990). Consequently, all that is left of the Samaritan community in Nablus itself is an abandoned synagogue.

While the Samaritan communities in both the West Bank's Nablus and Israeli Holon have assimilated to the surrounding respective cultures, Hebrew has become the primary domestic language for Samaritans. Samaritans who are Israeli citizens are drafted into the military, along with the Jewish citizens of Israel.\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Samaritans praying during Passover holiday ceremony on mount Grizim.jpg|thumb|Samaritans celebrating Passover on Mount Grizim in the West Bank]]\nRelations of Samaritans with Jewish Israelis and Muslim and Christian Palestinians in neighboring areas have been mixed. Samaritans living in both Israel and in the West Bank enjoy Israeli [[citizenship]]. Samaritans in the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]-ruled territories are a minority in the midst of a Muslim majority.

With such a small population, divided into only four families ([[Kohen|Cohen]], Tsedakah, Danafi, and Marhiv, with the Matar family dying out in 1968)<ref> Israelite Samaritan Families Today, Benyamin Tsedakah https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/about-israelite-samaritans/families/?amp</ref><ref>The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage, Monika Schreiber https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4We7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=samaritan+%22matar%22+family&source=bl&ots=H6ZTZVMMP1&sig=ACfU3U2g7k2OtSoeFpTAX10PVRPpbwu9rQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC8afV4cXmAhV2QEEAHQU3CdMQ6AEwAnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=samaritan%20%22matar%22%20family&f=false</ref> and a general refusal to accept converts, there has been a history of [[genetic disorder]]s within the group due to the small [[gene pool]]. To counter this, the Samaritan community has recently agreed that men from the community marry non-Samaritan (primarily, Israeli Jewish) women, provided that the women agree to follow Samaritan religious practices. There is a six-month trial period before officially joining the Samaritan community to see whether this is a commitment that the woman would like to take. This often poses a problem for the women, who are typically less than eager to adopt the strict interpretation of biblical (Levitical) laws regarding [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]], by which they must live in a separate dwelling during their periods and after [[childbirth]]. There have been a few instances of [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. In addition, all marriages within the Samaritan community are first approved by a [[geneticist]] at [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel HaShomer Hospital]], in order to prevent the spread of genetic disorders.

Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.\n\n===Samaritan Temple===\nAccording to Samaritans,<ref>http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614010749/http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm |date=June 14, 2008 }}</ref> it was on [[Mount Gerizim]] that Abraham was commanded by God to offer Isaac, his son, as a sacrifice.<ref>{{Bibleref|Genesis|22:2|9}}</ref> In both narratives, God then causes the sacrifice to be interrupted, explaining that this was the ultimate test of Abraham's obedience, as a result of which all the world would receive blessing.\n\n[[File:Harry Fenn. Ruins on the summit of Mount Gerizim, on the site of the Samaritan temple. 1881-1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins on Mount Gerizim c. 1880.]]\n\nThe Torah mentions the place where God chooses to establish His name (Deut 12:5), and Judaism takes this to refer to Jerusalem. However, the Samaritan text speaks of the place where God ''has chosen'' to establish His name, and Samaritans identify it as Mount Gerizim, making it the focus of their spiritual values.\n\nThe legitimacy of the Samaritan temple was attacked by Jewish scholars including [[Andronicus ben Meshullam]].\n\nIn the Christian Bible, the [[Gospel of John]] relates an [[Samaritan woman at the well|encounter]] between a Samaritan woman and [[Jesus]] in which she says that the mountain was the center of their worship. She poses the question to Jesus when she realizes that he is the Messiah. Jesus affirms the Jewish position, saying \"You (that is, the Samaritans) worship what you do not know\".<ref>{{Bibleref|John|4:22|9}}</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\n* There is one [[God]], [[Yahweh|YHWH]], the same God recognized by the [[prophet#The Hebrew and Jewish concepts of prophet|Hebrew prophets]].\n* The [[Torah]] was given by God to [[Moses]].\n* [[Mount Gerizim]], not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by Israel's God.\n* Many Samaritans believe that at the end of days, the dead will be [[resurrection|resurrected]] by the Taheb, a restorer (possibly a prophet, some say Moses).\n* Resurrection and Paradise.\n* The priests are the interpreters of the law and the keepers of tradition; scholars are secondary to the priesthood.\n* The authority of post-Torah sections of the Tanakh, and classical Jewish [[Rabbi]]nical works (the [[Talmud]], comprising the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Gemara]]) is rejected.\n* They have a [[Ten Commandments#Samaritan|significantly different version]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] (for example, their 10th commandment is about the sanctity of Mount Gerizim).\n\nThe Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the [[Samaritan alphabet|Ancient Hebrew script]], a [[High Priest of Israel|High Priesthood]], the slaughtering and eating of [[Lamb and mutton|lambs]] on [[Passover]] eve, and the celebration of the first month's beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru`ah (the biblical name for \"[[Rosh Hashanah]]\"), at the beginning of [[Tishrei]], is not considered a [[New Year]] as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] differs from the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]] as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is \"the place that God ''has chosen''\" to establish His name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to \"the place that God ''chooses''\". Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Samaritans.jpg|Samaritans, from a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].\nFile:2106 WLM - OVEDC - Mount Gerizim - SUKUT 15.jpg|Sukkot on Mount Gerizim\nFile:Bitknest2.jpg|Entrance to a modern Samaritan synagogue in the city of [[Holon]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n===Relationship to Rabbinic Judaism===\n[[File:Samaritan doorpost.jpg|thumb|upright|The Samaritan [[mezuzah]] engraved above the front door]]\n\nSamaritans refer to themselves as ''Benai Yisrael'' (\"[[Children of Israel]]\") which is a term used by all Jewish denominations as a name for the Jewish people as a whole. They, however, do not refer to themselves as ''Yehudim'' (Jews), the standard Hebrew name for Jews.\n\nThe Talmudic attitude expressed in [[Minor tractate|tractate Kutim]] is that they are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice coincides with Rabbinic Judaism but as non-Jews where their practice differs. Some claim that since the 19th century, Rabbinic Judaism has regarded the Samaritans as a Jewish sect and the term \"Samaritan Jews\" has been used for them.<ref>Shulamit Sela, ''The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title'', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 57, No. 2 (1994), pp. 255-267</ref>\n\n===Religious texts===\nSamaritan law is not the same as [[Halakha]] (Rabbinic Jewish law). The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:\n\n* '''[[Torah]]'''\n** ''[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]'': There are some 6,000 differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch text; and, according to one estimate, 1,900 points of agreement between it and the Greek LXX version. Several passages in the [[New Testament]] would also appear to echo a Torah textual tradition not dissimilar to that conserved in the Samaritan text. There are several theories regarding the similarities.

Thring was enthusiastic about the show and decided to produce it professionally. He hired an all star cast, putting Gladys Moncrieff, Australia's most popular star of light opera under a 12-month contract to play the lead. He also brought back two Australians from overseas to appear opposite her, Robert Chisholm and Claude Fleming, and hired the most popular comic of the day, George Wallace, to play the comic support role of Dandy Dan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17033105 |title=MUSIC AND DRAMA. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 December 1933 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nWallace's presence in the cast meant his part was expanded and he was given as many songs as Glady Moncrieff; in addition, parts were found for his regular collaborators, Marshall Crosby and [[John Dobbie]]. Extra lures to the theatre-going audience was a revolving stage, the first of its kind used in Australia, and the performance of an aboriginal corroboree at the beginning of Act Two.\n\nThe resulting production debuted in December 1933. It was a widely publicised occasion, attended by the state premier and lord mayor and the first act was broadcast live on Radio 3KZ. \"All this excitement over an Australian show with an all-Australian cast\", wrote Thring's biographer, Peter Fitzpatrick. \"Nothing like it had happened before. Frank [Thring]... must have felt like a king... It was certainly the most triumphant night of his life.\"<ref>Fitzpatrick p 199</ref>\n\nThe show was a big success, receiving excellent reviews and playing for sixteen weeks and over a hundred performances at the Princess.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11724052 |title=MUSIC, DRAMA & FILMS \"COLLITS' INN\". |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=26 December 1933 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> It went to Sydney for eight weeks, then had a three-week return season in Melbourne in October 1934.\n\nThe success of the musical encouraged Thring to expand his theatrical productions.

The performance video was streamed on the project's independent label's website, To whom it may concern., on November 16, 2010, and released as a digital album on December 4, the same year, the project's one-year anniversary. For the project's seven-year anniversary in 2016,<ref name=\"trailer\"/> the film was made available for download and streaming,<ref name=\"vod\"/> and released on DVD on April 10, 2017.<ref name=\"twimc3\"/>\n\nThe one-hour performance takes place in [[Handen]], Sweden, with a single attendee chosen by followers to represent the audience.\n\n==Background and performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"width:22em\"\n|+style=\"text-align:left\"|Set list\n|-\n|style=\"padding:1em\"|\n{{ordered list|list_style=margin-left:2em\n| \"u-1\"\n| \"b\"\n| Interlude: \"Prelude 699130082.451322-5.4.21.3.1.20.9.15.14.1.12\"\n| \"t\"\n| Interlude: \"20101001\"\n| \"n\"\n| \"o\"\n| Interlude: \"13.1.14.4.18.1.7.15.18.1.1110\"\n| \"u-2\"\n| Interlude: \"15.6.6.9.3.9.14.1.18.21.13.56155\"\n| \"y\"\n| \"9.20.19.13.5.723378\"\n| \".\"\n}}\n|}\n\nTwo months since the release of \"y\", the seventh episode from the ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' audiovisual series and album, a video requesting a volunteer was uploaded to iamamiwhomami's channel on October 1, 2010.<ref name=\"vogue\"/> This would be the first time the project addressed the audience directly, but not the first message the project delivered.<ref name=\"mtv-mail\"/> At the time, no official confirmation regarding who was behind the act, the internet's speculation already had name for the woman in the videos, Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/><ref name=\"telegraph\"/><ref name=\"mtv-jonna\"/>\nFollowing the cryptic nature of the project, the video instructed viewers to choose their representative by October 8, with full name, phone number, and address, with no explanation of the purpose.<ref name=\"yt20101001\"/> This resulted in fans choosing YouTube user Hillary ''tehhils'',<ref name=\"forsakenorder-20101001\"/> who had to decline claiming difficulties to obtain a passport and suggested to pass on the task to German<ref name=\"aqnb\"/><ref name=\"lonelyleaf\"/> user ''ShootUpTheStation''. Subsequently, a video documenting a phone call made by Jonna Lee to the volunteer was uploaded on November 9, where she interviews him with questions about things like health, phobias, habits, and beliefs, ending with \"we will pick you up to the airport\" and requesting him to \"film [his] entire journey\".<ref name=\"yt20101109\"/> A series of six short videos from ShootUpTheStation's camera were uploaded from November 12 to 15, in which he documented his journey and his stay at a hotel where multiple visitors would come in to deliver a lesson.<ref name=\"volunteer-playlist\"/><ref name=\"jwz\"/>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, a concert was finally announced on a video titled \"http&#58;&#47;&#47;towhomitmayconcern.cc&#47;\",<ref name=\"yt-announcement\"/><ref name=\"vogue\"/> which would later become the label's website and store.\n\nThe performance consist of the 7 ''bounty'' songs released in 2010, as well as the third ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' prelude \u2014which would later have a studio version released as \"LIKE HELL\" on ionnalee's ''[[Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten|EVERYONE AFRAID TO BE FORGOTTEN]]''\u2014, and a new song known as \".\" ({{lang|sv|punkt}}) \u2014studio version later released as \"shadowshow\" on ''[[Blue (iamamiwhoami album)|BLUE]]''\u2014. The interludes are also some of the preludes, and music from the promos leading to the concert.\n\n==Release==\nThe concert video installation began streaming at approximately 00:15 CET on November 16, 2010, on the label's website, lasting 64 minutes and was available to be viewed for three additional hours on the site.<ref name=\"higherplain\"/> The project went inactive after this, until it was released as a single-track album on digital stores and streaming platforms on December 4, 2010,<ref name=\"itunes\"/> coinciding with the audiovisual group's one-year anniversary. Along with the album release, singles for some songs from the performance were made available: \"b\", \"t\", \"n\", \"o\", \"u-2\", \"y\", and \".\" (pronounced \"{{lang|sv|[[wikt:punkt#Swedish|punkt]]}}\";<ref name=\"gaynight-interview\"/> \"period\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"itunes-iam\"/>\nIn 2013, the album and its singles were pulled from all retailers.<ref name=\"iambf\"/>\n\nAgain, for the project's seventh anniversary on December 4, 2016, the film was released for download and on-demand streaming, and then a DVD edition came on April 10, 2017.

In round 19 against {{AFL Car}}, he earned a [[NAB Rising Star]] nomination for his 28 possessions and 2 goals. Boak's went on to play in the Port Adelaide team which competed in the [[2007 AFL Grand Final]] against {{AFL Gee}}, losing by a record margin.

He played in 17 games and averaged 20.1 disposals. Boak continued to improve in 2009 winning the Gavin Wanganeen Medal and averaging 23.7 disposals for the season.\n\nThe 2010 season was Boak's best season to date with a career best average of 23 possessions per game. His season ended with a flourish when he kicked three goals in each of the final two rounds.

{"title_page": "The White Horse Inn", "text_new": "{{Other uses|The White Horse Inn (disambiguation)}}\n{{see also|White Horse Inn (Broadway version)}}\n'''''White Horse Inn''''' (or ''The White Horse Inn''), (German title: '''''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl'''''), is an [[operetta]] or [[musical theater|musical comedy]] by [[Ralph Benatzky]] and [[Robert Stolz]] in collaboration with a number of other composers and writers, set in the picturesque [[Salzkammergut]] region of [[Upper Austria]]. It is about the head waiter of the White Horse Inn in [[St. Wolfgang (village)|St. Wolfgang]] who is desperately in love with the owner of the [[Public house#Inns|inn]], a resolute young woman who at first only has eyes for one of her regular guests. Sometimes classified as an [[operetta]], the show enjoyed huge successes both on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in the [[West End of London|West End]] (651 performances at the [[Coliseum Theatre|Coliseum]] starting 8 April 1931) and was filmed several times. In a way similar to ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and the three ''[[Elisabeth of Bavaria#Elisabeth: The myth|Sissi]]'' movies, the play and its film versions have contributed to the [[Wiktionary:saccharine#Etymology 1|saccharine]] image of [[Austria]] as an [[Alps|alpine]] [[idyll]]&mdash;the kind of idyll [[tourism|tourists]] have been seeking for almost a century now. Today, ''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl'' is mainly remembered for its songs, many of which have become popular classics.\n\n==The original play==\nIn the last decade of the 19th century, [[Oscar Blumenthal]], a theatre director from [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], was on holiday in Lauffen (now part of [[Bad Ischl]]), a small town in the vicinity of St. Wolfgang. There, at the inn where he was staying, Blumenthal happened to witness the head waiter's painful wooing of his boss, a widow. Amused, Blumenthal used the story as the basis of a [[comedy]]&mdash;without music&mdash;which he co-authored with actor [[Gustav Kadelburg]]. However, Blumenthal and Kadelburg relocated the action from Lauffen to the much more prominent St. Wolfgang, where the Gasthof Wei\u00dfes R\u00f6\u00dfl had actually existed since 1878. Having thus chanced upon a suitable title, the authors went to work, and ''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl'' eventually premiered in Berlin in 1897.\n\nThe play was an immediate success. The Berlin audience would laugh at the comic portrayal of well-to-do city dwellers such as Wilhelm Giesecke, a producer of [[undergarment|underwear]], and his daughter Ottilie, who have travelled all the way from Berlin to St. Wolfgang and now, on holiday, cannot help displaying many of the characteristics of the [[nouveau riche|nouveaux-riches]]. \"W\u00e4r' ick blo\u00df nach [[Ahlbeck (Usedom)|Ahlbeck]] jefahren\"&mdash;\"If only I had gone to Ahlbeck\", Giesecke sighs as he considers his unfamiliar surroundings and the strange [[dialect]] spoken by the wild [[mountain people]] that inhabit the Salzkammergut. At the same time the play promoted [[tourism in Austria]], especially in and around St. Wolfgang, with a contemporary edition of the [[Baedeker]] praising the natural beauty of the region and describing the White Horse Inn as nicely situated at the lakefront next to where the [[steamboat]] can be taken for a romantic trip across the [[Wolfgangsee]]. The White Horse Inn was even awarded a [[star (classification)|Baedeker star]].\n\n[[Sydney Rosenfeld]], a prolific American adapter of foreign plays, debuted an English version of the play titled ''At the White Horse Tavern'' at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1899, with a cast including [[Amelia Bingham]] and [[Leo Ditrichstein]].<ref name=\"story\">(16 August 1936).

During a visit to the Salzkammergut, the actor [[Emil Jannings]] told Berlin theatre manager [[Erik Charell]] about the comedy. Charell was interested and commissioned a group of prominent authors and composers to come up with a musical show based on Blumenthal and Kadelburg's play. They were [[Ralph Benatzky]], [[Robert Stolz]] and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (music), [[Robert Gilbert (musician)|Robert Gilbert]] (lyrics), [[Hans M\u00fcller-Einigen]] and Charell himself.\n\nThe show premiered in Berlin on November 8, 1930. Immediately afterwards it became a success around the world, with long runs in cities like [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Vienna]], [[Munich]] and [[New York, New York|New York]]. During the [[Third Reich]] the comedy was marginalized and not performed ([[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] called it \"eine Revue, die uns heute zum Hals heraush\u00e4ngt\"&mdash;\"the kind of entertainment we find boring and superfluous today\"), whereas people in the 1950s, keen on harmony and shallow pleasures, eagerly greeted revivals of the show. German-language films based on the musical comedy were made in [[1935 in film|1935]], [[1952 in film|1952]] and [[1960 in film|1960]].\n\n==Roles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere Cast, 8 November 1930<br>(Conductor:)\n|-\n|Dr. Otto Siedler, lawyer\n|[[tenor]] \n|[[Otto Wallburg]]\n|-\n|Josepha Vogelhuber, landlady\n|[[soprano]] \n|[[Camilla Spira]]\n|-\n|Franz Joseph, emperor of Austria-Hungary \n|[[baritone]] \n|[[Paul H\u00f6rbiger]]\n|-\n|Wilhelm Giesecke, Berlin factory owner\n|spoken\n|Walter Jankuhn ([[:de:Walter Jankuhn|de]])\n|-\n|Ottilie Giesecke, his daughter\n|soprano \n|[[Trude Lieske]]\n|-\n|Sigismund S\u00fclzheimer, son of Giesecke's competitor\n|[[bass (vocal range)|bass]] \n|[[Siegfried Arno]]\n|-\n|Professor Dr. Hinzelmann, tourist\n|baritone\n|\n|-\n|Kl\u00e4rchen Hinzelmann, his daughter \n|soprano\n|\n|-\n|Leopold Brandmeyer, waiter\n|tenor \n|[[Max Hansen (tenor)|Max Hansen]]\t\n|-\n|Piccolo, apprentice waiter\n|\n|[[Manasse Herbst]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Laura Desni]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Marianne Winkelstein]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Willi Schaeffers]]\n|}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nIt is summertime at the Wolfgangsee. Josepha Vogelhuber, the young, attractive but resolute owner of the White Horse Inn, has been [[courtship|courted]] for some time by her head waiter, Leopold Brandmeyer. While appreciating his aptness for the job, she mistrusts all men as potential gold-diggers, rejects Leopold's advances and longingly waits for the arrival of Dr Siedler, a lawyer who has been one of her regular guests for many years. This year, Josepha hopes, Siedler might eventually propose to her.\n\nWhen Siedler arrives, he finds himself in the very same place with Wilhelm Giesecke, his client S\u00fclzheimer's business rival, and immediately falls in love with Giesecke's beautiful daughter Ottilie. As it happens, S\u00fclzheimer's son Sigismund, a would-be beau, also arrives at the White Horse Inn. Angry at first about that person's presence at the same inn, Giesecke soon has the idea of marrying off his daughter to Sigismund S\u00fclzheimer, thus turning a pending [[lawsuit]] into an advantageous business [[merger]]. However, Siedler's love is reciprocated by Ottilie, who adamantly refuses to marry Sigismund, while Sigismund himself has fallen for Kl\u00e4rchen Hinzelmann, a naive beauty who accompanies her professorial father on a tour through the Salzkammergut.\n\nSeeing all this, Leopold Brandmeyer decides that he has had enough and quits his job. Josepha has also done a lot of thinking in the meantime, reconsiders her head waiter's proposal of marriage, and can persuade him to stay&mdash;not just as an employee but also as boss. Love gets its way with the other two couples as well, and the play ends with the prospect of a triple marriage.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl am Wolfgangsee\" (Music: Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Was kann der Sigismund daf\u00fcr, dass er so sch\u00f6n ist\" (Robert Gilbert)\n* \"Im Salzkammergut, da kann man gut lustig sein\" (Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Es muss was Wunderbares sein\" (Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Mein Liebeslied muss ein Walzer sein\" (Robert Stolz)\n* \"Zuschaun kann i net\" ([[Bruno Granichstaedten]])\n* \"Die ganze Welt ist himmelblau\" (Robert Stolz)\n\n==Film adaptations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n![[The White Horse Inn (1926 film)|Germany 1926]] (silent film based on the 1898 play)\n![[The White Horse Inn (1935 film)|Austria 1935]]\n![[The White Horse Inn (1952 film)|West Germany 1952]]\n![[The White Horse Inn (1960 film)|West Germany / Austria 1960]]\n![[Summer in Tyrol|Denmark / Austria 1964]]\n!Germany 1994 (live performance at Berlin's \"Bar jeder Vernunft\")\n!Germany/Austria 2013 <br> (''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl \u2013 Wehe Du singst!

A [[Denmark|Danish]] film of [[1964 in film|1964]] by [[Erik Balling]], ''[[Summer in Tyrol|Sommer i Tyrol]]'' (although the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] is '''not''' the original setting), starred [[Dirch Passer]] and [[Susse Wold]].\n\nIn addition, the musical triggered a number of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s such as the [[1961 in film|1961]] Austrian comedy film ''Im schwarzen R\u00f6\u00dfl'' (''The Black Horse Inn''), directed by [[Franz Antel]], about a young woman (surprisingly, it was [[Karin Dor]] again, who had just played Giesecke's daughter in the [[1960 in film|1960]] version) who inherits a dilapidated [[hotel]] on the shores of the Wolfgangsee. As a matter of fact, a number of hotels in St. Wolfgang do use similar names (Black Horse, White Stag, etc.).\n\nMost recently, a new musical film adaptation of \"Im Weissen R\u00f6ssl\" came out in November 2013 with the German title ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl \u2013 Wehe Du singst!|de}}'' from director Christian Theede. Unlike its predecessors, however, the movie was not filmed on location at the Hotel Im Weissen R\u00f6ssl in St. Wolfgang, Austria.\n\n==A note on the spelling==\nAccording to the [[German spelling reform]] of the 1990s, which curbed the use of the letter ''[[\u00df]]'', ''R\u00f6\u00dfl'', which has a [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] added to the noun ''Ro\u00df'' (\"horse\", \"steed\"), now has to be spelt ''R\u00f6ssl'' (just as it is ''Ross'' now instead of ''Ro\u00df''). Therefore, both ''R\u00f6\u00dfl'' and ''R\u00f6ssl'' can be seen nowadays, depending on when a particular text was written.\n\n==References==\n* {{Almanacco|dmy=08-11-1930|match=Benatzky|label=Details of the premiere}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.weissesroessl.at/en-history-hotel-st-wolfgang.htm History of The White Horse Inn in St. Wolfgang]\n{{The White Horse Inn}}\n{{Ralph Benatzky}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Horse Inn, The}}\n[[Category:German-language operettas]]\n[[Category:Compositions set in Austria]]\n[[Category:Broadway musicals]]\n[[Category:West End musicals]]\n[[Category:1930 musicals]]\n[[Category:Operas by Ralph Benatzky]]\n[[Category:Compositions by Robert Stolz]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|The White Horse Inn (disambiguation)}}\n'''''White Horse Inn''''' (or ''The White Horse Inn''), (German title: '''''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl'''''), is an [[operetta]] or [[musical theater|musical comedy]] by [[Ralph Benatzky]] and [[Robert Stolz]] in collaboration with a number of other composers and writers, set in the picturesque [[Salzkammergut]] region of [[Upper Austria]].

German-language films based on the musical comedy were made in [[1935 in film|1935]], [[1952 in film|1952]] and [[1960 in film|1960]].\n\n==Roles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere Cast, 8 November 1930<br>(Conductor:)\n|-\n|Dr. Otto Siedler, lawyer\n|[[tenor]] \n|[[Otto Wallburg]]\n|-\n|Josepha Vogelhuber, landlady\n|[[soprano]] \n|[[Camilla Spira]]\n|-\n|Franz Joseph, emperor of Austria-Hungary \n|[[baritone]] \n|[[Paul H\u00f6rbiger]]\n|-\n|Wilhelm Giesecke, Berlin factory owner\n|spoken\n|Walter Jankuhn ([[:de:Walter Jankuhn|de]])\n|-\n|Ottilie Giesecke, his daughter\n|soprano \n|[[Trude Lieske]]\n|-\n|Sigismund S\u00fclzheimer, son of Giesecke's competitor\n|[[bass (vocal range)|bass]] \n|[[Siegfried Arno]]\n|-\n|Professor Dr. Hinzelmann, tourist\n|baritone\n|\n|-\n|Kl\u00e4rchen Hinzelmann, his daughter \n|soprano\n|\n|-\n|Leopold Brandmeyer, waiter\n|tenor \n|[[Max Hansen (tenor)|Max Hansen]]\t\n|-\n|Piccolo, apprentice waiter\n|\n|[[Manasse Herbst]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Laura Desni]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Marianne Winkelstein]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|[[Willi Schaeffers]]\n|}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nIt is summertime at the Wolfgangsee. Josepha Vogelhuber, the young, attractive but resolute owner of the White Horse Inn, has been [[courtship|courted]] for some time by her head waiter, Leopold Brandmeyer. While appreciating his aptness for the job, she mistrusts all men as potential gold-diggers, rejects Leopold's advances and longingly waits for the arrival of Dr Siedler, a lawyer who has been one of her regular guests for many years. This year, Josepha hopes, Siedler might eventually propose to her.\n\nWhen Siedler arrives, he finds himself in the very same place with Wilhelm Giesecke, his client S\u00fclzheimer's business rival, and immediately falls in love with Giesecke's beautiful daughter Ottilie. As it happens, S\u00fclzheimer's son Sigismund, a would-be beau, also arrives at the White Horse Inn. Angry at first about that person's presence at the same inn, Giesecke soon has the idea of marrying off his daughter to Sigismund S\u00fclzheimer, thus turning a pending [[lawsuit]] into an advantageous business [[merger]]. However, Siedler's love is reciprocated by Ottilie, who adamantly refuses to marry Sigismund, while Sigismund himself has fallen for Kl\u00e4rchen Hinzelmann, a naive beauty who accompanies her professorial father on a tour through the Salzkammergut.\n\nSeeing all this, Leopold Brandmeyer decides that he has had enough and quits his job. Josepha has also done a lot of thinking in the meantime, reconsiders her head waiter's proposal of marriage, and can persuade him to stay&mdash;not just as an employee but also as boss. Love gets its way with the other two couples as well, and the play ends with the prospect of a triple marriage.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl am Wolfgangsee\" (Music: Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Was kann der Sigismund daf\u00fcr, dass er so sch\u00f6n ist\" (Robert Gilbert)\n* \"Im Salzkammergut, da kann man gut lustig sein\" (Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Es muss was Wunderbares sein\" (Ralph Benatzky)\n* \"Mein Liebeslied muss ein Walzer sein\" (Robert Stolz)\n* \"Zuschaun kann i net\" ([[Bruno Granichstaedten]])\n* \"Die ganze Welt ist himmelblau\" (Robert Stolz)\n\n==Film adaptations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n![[The White Horse Inn (1926 film)|Germany 1926]] (silent film based on the 1898 play)\n![[The White Horse Inn (1935 film)|Austria 1935]]\n![[The White Horse Inn (1952 film)|West Germany 1952]]\n![[The White Horse Inn (1960 film)|West Germany / Austria 1960]]\n![[Summer in Tyrol|Denmark / Austria 1964]]\n!Germany 1994 (live performance at Berlin's \"Bar jeder Vernunft\")\n!Germany/Austria 2013 <br> (''Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl \u2013 Wehe Du singst!

A [[Denmark|Danish]] film of [[1964 in film|1964]] by [[Erik Balling]], ''[[Summer in Tyrol|Sommer i Tyrol]]'' (although the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] is '''not''' the original setting), starred [[Dirch Passer]] and [[Susse Wold]].\n\nIn addition, the musical triggered a number of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s such as the [[1961 in film|1961]] Austrian comedy film ''Im schwarzen R\u00f6\u00dfl'' (''The Black Horse Inn''), directed by [[Franz Antel]], about a young woman (surprisingly, it was [[Karin Dor]] again, who had just played Giesecke's daughter in the [[1960 in film|1960]] version) who inherits a dilapidated [[hotel]] on the shores of the Wolfgangsee. As a matter of fact, a number of hotels in St. Wolfgang do use similar names (Black Horse, White Stag, etc.).\n\nMost recently, a new musical film adaptation of \"Im Weissen R\u00f6ssl\" came out in November 2013 with the German title ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl \u2013 Wehe Du singst!|de}}'' from director Christian Theede. Unlike its predecessors, however, the movie was not filmed on location at the Hotel Im Weissen R\u00f6ssl in St. Wolfgang, Austria.\n\n==A note on the spelling==\nAccording to the [[German spelling reform]] of the 1990s, which curbed the use of the letter ''[[\u00df]]'', ''R\u00f6\u00dfl'', which has a [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] added to the noun ''Ro\u00df'' (\"horse\", \"steed\"), now has to be spelt ''R\u00f6ssl'' (just as it is ''Ross'' now instead of ''Ro\u00df''). Therefore, both ''R\u00f6\u00dfl'' and ''R\u00f6ssl'' can be seen nowadays, depending on when a particular text was written.\n\n==References==\n* {{Almanacco|dmy=08-11-1930|match=Benatzky|label=Details of the premiere}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.weissesroessl.at/en-history-hotel-st-wolfgang.htm History of The White Horse Inn in St. Wolfgang]\n{{The White Horse Inn}}\n{{Ralph Benatzky}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Horse Inn, The}}\n\n[[Category:German-language operettas]]\n[[Category:Compositions set in Austria]]\n[[Category:Broadway musicals]]\n[[Category:West End musicals]]\n[[Category:1930 musicals]]\n[[Category:Operas by Ralph Benatzky]]\n[[Category:Compositions by Robert Stolz]]\n", "name_user": "Loriendrew", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Horse_Inn"}
