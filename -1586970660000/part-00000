Washington was born on his family's [[Cedar Lawn]] plantation near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], [[Virginia]] (present-day [[West Virginia]]) and was the eldest of 13 children. He practiced law, then served as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Virginia militia|Virginia Volunteers]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. During his service in the war, Washington reportedly wore the sword of his great-granduncle George Washington.\n\nFollowing the Mexican\u2013American War, Washington traveled to California in 1849 as a [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-niner]] in the [[California Gold Rush]] and authored the novel, ''A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence''. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained for a few years and fought as a [[Border Ruffian]] during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] confrontations over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] along the border between [[Kansas Territory]] and Missouri. While under the command of Captain [[Henry Clay Pate]], Washington was present at the June 1856 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Stater]] attack known as [[Battle of Black Jack]], where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a [[steamboat]] on the [[Missouri River]] in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by [[Jayhawker]]s.\n\nWashington was a great-grandson of [[Samuel Washington]], a great-grandnephew of first [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]], a great-grandson of [[Robert Rutherford (congressman)|Robert Rutherford]], a [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from Virginia, and a nephew of [[Henry Bedinger|Henry Bedinger III]], also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n== Early life and family ==\n[[File:Cedar Lawn, West Virginia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Washington's [[birthplace]], \"[[Cedar Lawn]]\" near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]]. \"[[Cedar Lawn]]\" was built by Washington's father, [[John Thornton Augustine Washington]], in 1825.]]\nLawrence Berry Washington was born on November 26, 1811, at \"[[Cedar Lawn]]\" plantation near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County]], [[Virginia]] (present-day [[West Virginia]]) and was the eldest son of [[John Thornton Augustine Washington]] and his wife Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger Washington.<ref name = \"Welles1\">{{Harvnb|Welles|1879|pp=208\u2013209.}}</ref><ref name = \"Kunitz1\">{{Harvnb|Kunitz|Haycraft|Hadden|1933|p=51.}}</ref><ref name=\"Bacon1\">{{Harvnb|Bacon|1908|p=755.}}</ref>\n\nThrough his father, Washington was a grandson of Thornton Augustine Washington, a great-grandson of [[Samuel Washington]], and a great-grandnephew of first [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]].<ref name = \"Welles1\"/><ref name = \"Kunitz1\"/> Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of [[Robert Rutherford (congressman)|Robert Rutherford]], a [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from Virginia, and a nephew of [[Henry Bedinger|Henry Bedinger III]], also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives who later served as [[United States Ambassador to Denmark|Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires]] and [[United States Ambassador to Denmark|Minister to Denmark]] for President [[Franklin Pierce]].<ref name = \"Welles1\"/><ref name = \"McGee1\">{{Harvnb|McGee|1973|p=3.}}</ref> Washington was raised in a large family at Cedar Lawn, where he had four brothers and eight sisters:<ref name = \"Welles1\"/><ref name = \"Cooper1\">{{Harvnb|Cooper County, Missouri Genealogical Web (GenWeb) Project|2012|p=1.}}</ref><ref name = \"Harrison1\">{{Harvnb|Harrison|2005|pp=1943\u20131945.}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Daniel Bedinger Washington (born 1814)\n* Virginia Thornton Washington (1816\u20131838)\n* Sally Eleanor Washington (1818\u20131858)\n* [[Benjamin Franklin Washington]] (1820\u20131872)\n* Georgiana Augusta Washington Smith (born 1822)\n* Mary Elizabeth Washington Asbury (born 1824)\n* John Thornton Augustine Washington (1826\u20131894)\n* Mildred Berry Washington (September 3\u201312, 1827)\n* Mildred Berry Washington Bedinger (1829\u20131871)\n* George Washington (born 1830)\n* Susan Ellsworth Washington Bedinger (born 1833)\n* Henrietta Gray Washington (1835\u20131838)\n}}\n\nBecause of his large number of siblings, Washington's inheritance from his father in 1841 was not sizable, and he and his brothers pursued a number of business opportunities to build their personal wealth.<ref name = \"Wallace2\">{{Harvnb|Wallace|1951|p=110.}}</ref> Washington studied jurisprudence, and was operating a law practice in Charles Town by November 1844.<ref name=\"SOJ1\">{{cite news| title =Lawrence B.

While under the command of Captain [[Henry Clay Pate]], Washington was present at the June 1856 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Stater]] attack known as [[Battle of Black Jack]], where he sustained minor injuries.

{"title_page": "Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange", "text_new": "{{Contains Indic text}}\n'''Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange''' ('''TSCII''') is a coding scheme for representing the [[Tamil script]].  The lower 128 codepoints are plain [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]], the upper 128 codepoints are TSCII-specific. After long years of being used on the Internet by private agreement only, it was successfully registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] in 2007.<ref>http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-reg/TSCII</ref>\n\n'''TSCII''' encodes the characters in visual (written) order, paralleling the use of the Tamil Typewriter.\n\n[[Unicode]] has used the logical order encoding strategy for Tamil, following [[ISCII]], in contrast to the case of [[Thai alphabet|Thai]], where the visual order encoding grandfathered by [[Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533|TIS-620]] was adopted.\n\nThe government of [[Tamil Nadu]] endorses its own TAB/TAM standards for 8-bit encoding and other, older encoding schemes can still be found on the WWW.\n\nThe free etext collection at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040711082741/http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/ Project Madurai] uses the '''TSCII''' encoding, but has already started to provide [[Unicode]] versions.\n\n==History==\nThe need for a common encoding for Tamil was felt by members of various mailing list based forums in mid-1990s, as there were multiple custom coded fonts were prevalent in those forums.  While some of the commercial encodings were popular than the others, they were not accepted by wider community due to conflicting commercial interests. While Unicode was accepted by most as the future standard, most of the desktop systems at that time were still not capable of handling Unicode for Tamil language, and an interim 8-bit encoding was required.\n\nA separate mailing list for discussion of such encodings (webmasters@tamil.net) was created in 1997 to initiate this discussion, starting with an email written by [[Kuppuswamy Kalyanasundaram|Dr.K.Kalyanasundaram]] to the popular Tamil author [[Sujatha Rangarajan|Sujatha]] who headed the committee for standardization of Tamil keyboard.<ref>http://www.infitt.org/tscii/archives/msg00001.html</ref>  This forum quickly attracted enthusiastic participants from across the globe, including several prominent Tamil scholars. Archives of these discussion are maintained by [[INFITT]].<ref>http://www.infitt.org/tscii/archives/maillist.html</ref>\n\nSubsequent to publishing TSCII, most of the members of webmasters@tamil.net mailing list became part of INFITT, which is a wider initiative to bring in standardization and continued development in various areas of Tamil computing.\n\n==Codepage

text}}\n'''Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange''' ('''TSCII''') is a coding scheme for representing the [[Tamil script]].  The lower 128 codepoints are plain [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]], the upper 128 codepoints are TSCII-specific. After long years of being used on the Internet by private agreement only, it was successfully registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] in 2007.<ref>http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-reg/TSCII</ref>\n\n'''TSCII''' encodes the characters in visual (written) order, paralleling the use of the Tamil Typewriter.\n\n[[Unicode]] has used the logical order encoding strategy for Tamil, following [[ISCII]], in contrast to the case of [[Thai alphabet|Thai]], where the visual order encoding grandfathered by [[Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533|TIS-620]] was adopted.\n\nThe government of [[Tamil Nadu]] endorses its own TAB/TAM standards for 8-bit encoding and other, older encoding schemes can still be found on the WWW.\n\nThe free etext collection at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040711082741/http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/ Project Madurai] uses the '''TSCII''' encoding, but has already started to provide [[Unicode]] versions.\n\n==History==\nThe need for a common encoding for Tamil was felt by members of various mailing list based forums in mid-1990s, as there were multiple custom coded fonts were prevalent in those forums.  While some of the commercial encodings were popular than the others, they were not accepted by wider community due to conflicting commercial interests. While Unicode was accepted by most as the future standard, most of the desktop systems at that time were still not capable of handling Unicode for Tamil language, and an interim 8-bit encoding was required.\n\nA separate mailing list for discussion of such encodings (webmasters@tamil.net) was created in 1997 to initiate this discussion, starting with an email written by [[Kuppuswamy Kalyanasundaram|Dr.K.Kalyanasundaram]] to the popular Tamil author [[Sujatha Rangarajan|Sujatha]] who headed the committee for standardization of Tamil keyboard.<ref>http://www.infitt.org/tscii/archives/msg00001.html</ref>  This forum quickly attracted enthusiastic participants from across the globe, including several prominent Tamil scholars. Archives of these discussion are maintained by [[INFITT]].<ref>http://www.infitt.org/tscii/archives/maillist.html</ref>\n\nSubsequent to publishing TSCII, most of the members of webmasters@tamil.net mailing list became part of INFITT, which is a wider initiative to bring in standardization and continued development in various areas of Tamil computing.\n\n==Codepage
