It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the [[desalination]] of [[brackish water]] or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause serious injuries to the human body. There is evidence showing that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction in some people and chronic exposure may lead to organ damage. Diethylmethylamine can be converted to [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. In general Nitrosamines are considered to be [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]]. However, it occurs during production in certain foods, cosmetic, and hygiene products as an unwanted byproduct. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. The use of [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] can inhibit the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with a significant amount of nitrosamine are not allowed. Due to those reasons, it must be carefully stored in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always plays a role in extraction reactions due to its characteristics.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample. Further test by [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR-FTIR]] about the iron surface indicated through the reaction all molecular compound still remains the same as original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=P.|last2=Terryn|first2=H.|last3=Mol|first3=J.M.C.|date=2015-11-01|title=An in situ study of amine and amide molecular interaction on Fe surfaces|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=354|pages=242\u2013249|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.042|bibcode=2015ApSS..354..242T|issn=0169-4332}}</ref>\n\n=== Substrate of trimethylamine dehydrogenase half reaction ===\n[[Trimethylamine dehydrogenase]] is an enzyme which used as catalyst in [[chemical reaction]]. Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. If using [[trimethylamine]] as a substrate, it is hard to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence in detail. Diethylmethylamine has similar characteristic with trimethylamine but react slower than trimethylamine. For a better understanding and observation of the reductive half-reaction, diethylmethylamine was chosen to be the substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=M.H.|last2=Basran|first2=J.|last3=Scrutton|first3=N.S.|last4=Hille|first4=R.|date=1994-12-09|title=The reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine|url=https://www.jbc.org/content/274/19/13147.long|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=269|issue=49|pages=30869\u201330879|via=|pmid=7983019}}</ref>\n\nAnother research use diethylmethylamine to study the role 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond of trimethylamine dehydrogenase played in the half-reaction of the enzyme.

This study is mainly to investigate is there any difference between the removal of the 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond. Through the experiment, K<sub>fast</sub> is depend on the concentration of diethylmethylamine, and K<sub>int</sub> (K<sub>intermediate</sub>), K<sub>slow</sub> are independent to the concentration of diethylmethylamine.

However, diethylmethylamine has two opposite effect in the same reduction, and can change to each other based on different condition.

It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the [[desalination]] of [[brackish water]] or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause serious injuries to the human body. There is evidence showing that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction in some people and chronic exposure may lead to organ damage. Diethylmethylamine can be converted to [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. In general Nitrosamines are considered to be [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]]. However, it occurs during production in certain foods, cosmetic, and hygiene products as an unwanted byproduct. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. The use of [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] can inhibit the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with a significant amount of nitrosamine are not allowed. Due to those reasons, it must be carefully stored in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always play a role in extraction reaction due to its characteristic.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample.

Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. If using [[trimethylamine]] as a substrate, it is hard to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence in detail. Diethylmethylamine has similar characteristic with trimethylamine but react slower than trimethylamine.

With [[amino acid]]s, for example, in solution an [[equilibrium chemistry|chemical equilibrium]] will be established between the \"parent\" molecule and the zwitterion.\n\n[[Betaine]]s are zwitterions that cannot isomerize to an all-neutral form, such as when the positive charge is located on a [[quaternary ammonium]] group. Similarly, a molecule containing a [[phosphonium]] group and a carboxylate group cannot isomerize.\n\n==Amino acids==\n[[File:Amino Acid Zwitterion Structural Formulae V.1.svg|thumb|280px|An [[amino acid]] contains both acidic (carboxylic acid fragment) and basic (amine fragment) centres. The isomer on the right is a zwitterion.]]\n\nThe zwitterion is formed in two stages. In stage 1, a proton is transferred from the carboxyl group to a water molecule. \n:<math>H_2N(R)CO_2H + H_2O  \\leftrightharpoons H_2N(R)CO_2^- + H_3O^+</math>\nIn stage 2 a proton is transferred from the [[hydronium]] ion to the amine group\n:<math>H_2N(R)CO_2^- + H_3O^+ \\leftrightharpoons H_3N^+(R)CO_2^- + H_2O</math>\nThe reverse reactions occur in the reverse order. Overall, the reaction is an [[isomerization]] reaction\n:<math>H_2N(R)CO_2H \\leftrightharpoons H_3N^+(R)CO_2^-</math>\nThe ratio of the concentrations of the two species in solution will be independent of [[pH]] as it is equal to the value of the equilibrium constant for the isomerization reaction. \n\n:<math>K=\\frac{[H_3N^+(R)CO_2^-]}{[H_2N(R)CO_2H]}</math>\n\n[X] signifies the concentration of the chemical species X at equilibrium. The value of ''K'' cannot be determined experimentally. It is generally assumed that K>1, that is, that the zwitterion is the predominant amino acid isomer in solution. One explanation based on theoretical analysis is that the neutral form is less stable itself but becomes stabilized by [[hydrogen bonding]] with water molecules.<ref>{{cite journal |title= On the Number of Water Molecules Necessary To Stabilize the Glycine Zwitterion |first1= Jan H. |last1= Jensen |first2= Mark S. |last2= Gordon |journal= J.
