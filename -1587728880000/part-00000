''An Ideal World'' was licensed by various other companies and released simultaneously with the original publisher between 2006 and 2007. The French manhua-publishing company [[Xiao Pan]] licensed the series as \"''Un Monde Id\u00e9al''\" (\"An Ideal World\") and [[Yen Press]] later announced at the [[New York Comic Con]] that they had licensed the series from Xiao Pan. Yen Press released it in [[North America]] as one volume called ''An Ideal World''.\n\n''An Ideal World'' follows the struggles of A You, a young man who, believing he has no luck, does not attempt to succeed in life even though others advise him to make his own luck. When he accidentally gets on the wrong bus, A You finds himself in the suburbs, where he takes shelter from the rain in a large tree and takes a nap. After waking up, A You happens upon the house of an old man, who sends him to an alternate world so that he may resolve his troubles.  A You grows to enjoy the fantasy world and does not wish to return to his harsh reality. ''An Ideal World'' garnered mixed reception from Western critics, who objected mainly to the  beginning and praised the overall story, artwork and themes.\n\n==Plot==\nA You is a troubled 19-year-old who dislikes his life; he feels that his entire life is unlucky, yet he avoids hard work  and prefers to be lazy. He is encouraged by the people around him to work harder and told that he can change his life if he takes control of it, but A You refuses to accept these notions. One day, he accidentally takes the wrong bus and finds himself in the suburbs of his city. A You enjoys his time away and takes shelter inside of a large, hollow tree when it begins to rain. After taking a nap and waking up, he wanders until he comes across a small, green old man referred to as Grandpa Beard. Grandpa Beard decides to help A You with his problems and transports him to a \"utopia\" called Abi Port in an alternate world.\n\nAbi Port is home to several humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beings, and other creatures, some of which look similar to people A You knows in his world. A You is found by members of a circus, who invite him to join them in their act. Although he lacks experience, he finds that he can perform well and begins to develop feelings for a young performer named Anan. He meets others who give him advice on enjoying work and life, particularly the \"Master of Universal Love\", an anthropomorphic zebra who toiled to earn his position and helps others free of charge.\n\nAfter A You spends time in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his problems are solved and returns to take him away from the imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually marries his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.\n\n==Release==\n''An Ideal World'', authored by Weidong Chen and illustrated by Chao Peng,<ref name=\"yen\"/> was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company

''An Ideal World'' was licensed by various other companies and released simultaneously with the original publisher between 2006 and 2007. The French manhua-publishing company [[Xiao Pan]] licensed the series as \"''Un Monde Id\u00e9al''\" (\"An Ideal World\") and [[Yen Press]] later announced at the [[New York Comic Con]] that they had licensed the series from Xiao Pan. Yen Press released it in [[North America]] as one volume called ''An Ideal World''.\n\n''An Ideal World'' follows the struggles of A You, a young man who, believing he has no luck, does not attempt to succeed in life even though others advise him to make his own luck. When he accidentally gets on the wrong bus, A You finds himself in the suburbs, where he takes shelter from the rain in a large tree and takes a nap. After waking up, A You happens upon the house of an old man, who sends him to an alternate world so that he may resolve his troubles.  A You grows to enjoy the fantasy world and does not wish to return to his harsh reality. ''An Ideal World'' garnered mixed reception from Western critics, who objected mainly to the  beginning and praised the overall story, artwork and themes.\n\n==Plot==\nA You is a troubled 19-year-old who dislikes his life; he feels that his entire life is unlucky, yet he avoids hard work  and prefers to be lazy. He is encouraged by the people around him to work harder and told that he can change his life if he takes control of it, but A You refuses to accept these notions. One day, he accidentally takes the wrong bus and finds himself in the suburbs of his city. A You enjoys his time away and takes shelter inside of a large, hollow tree when it begins to rain. After taking a nap and waking up, he wanders until he comes across a small, green old man referred to as Grandpa Beard. Grandpa Beard decides to help A You with his problems and transports him to a \"utopia\" called Abi Port in an alternate world.\n\nAbi Port is home to several humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beings, and other creatures, some of which look similar to people A You knows in his world. A You is found by members of a circus, who invite him to join them in their act. Although he lacks experience, he finds that he can perform well and begins to develop feelings for a young performer named Anan. He meets others who give him advice on enjoying work and life, particularly the \"Master of Universal Love\", an anthropomorphic zebra who toiled to earn his position and helps others free of charge.\n\nAfter A You spends time in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his problems are solved and returns to take him away from the imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.\n\n==Release==\n''An Ideal World'', authored by Weidong Chen and illustrated by Chao Peng,<ref name=\"yen\"/> was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company

It is associated with John Whitton the \"father of new South Railways\", it is an imposing sandstone structure, a landmark for the historic town of Picton, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to [[Albury]] in 1883 to link with the Victorian line and to the development of Southern Western new South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works. It has proved to be a most cost-effective structure. It is unique being the first double track stone arch viaduct and retains its original fabric and function. It represents a major technological achievement in the construction of the Great Southern Railway line by John Whitton.<ref name=nswshr-1051/>\n\nPicton railway viaduct over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1051/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThis viaduct is the oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales.

However, a number of modern [[French language|French]] words and place names, including the country name \"France\", have a Frankish (i.e. [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) origin. France itself is still known by terms meaning the \"[[Frankish Realm]]\" in languages such as [[German language|German]] ({{lang|de|[[wikt:Frankreich|Frankreich]]}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ({{lang|nl|[[wikt:Frankrijk|Frankrijk]]}}), the derived [[Afrikaans]] ({{lang|af|[[wikt:Frankryk|Frankryk]]}}), and [[Danish language|Danish]] ({{lang|da|[[wikt:Frankrig|Frankrig]]}}) aswell as [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ({{lang|se|[[wikt:Frankrike|Frankrike]]}})..\n\nBetween the 5th and 9th centuries, Frankish spoken by the [[Salian Franks]] in present-day Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into [[Old Low Franconian]] (also known as [[Old Dutch]]), whereas Frankish spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] (also known as Rhineland Franks) evolved into the Franconian dialects of [[Old High German]] (later the [[Central Franconian]] and [[Rhine Franconian]] dialects of the [[German Language|German]] and [[Luxembourgish]] languages).\n\nThe Old Frankish language is poorly attested and mostly reconstructed from Frankish loanwords in [[Old French]], and from Old Dutch, as recorded in the 6th to 12th centuries. A notable exception is the [[Bergakker inscription]], which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{main|Name of the Franks}}\n[[Germanic philology]] and [[German studies]] have their origins in the first half of the 19th century when [[Romanticism]] and Romantic thought heavily influenced the lexicon of the [[linguist]]s and [[philologist]]s of the time, including pivotal figures such as the [[Brothers Grimm]]. As a result, many contemporary linguists tried to incorporate their findings in an already existing historical framework of \"[[stem duchies]]\" and {{lang|de|Altst\u00e4mme}} (lit. \"old tribes\", i.e. the six Germanic tribes then thought to have formed the \"German nation\" in the traditional German nationalism of the elites) resulting in a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] which spoke of \"[[Bavarii|Bavarian]]\", \"[[Saxons|Saxon]]\", \"[[Frisii|Frisian]]\", \"[[Thuringii|Thuringian]]\", \"[[Suebi|Swabian]]\" and \"[[Franks|Frankish]]\" dialects. While this nomenclature became generally accepted in traditional Germanic philology, it has also been described as \"inherently inaccurate\" as these ancient ethnic boundaries (as understood in the 19th century) bore little or limited resemblance to the actual or historical linguistic situation of the Germanic languages. Among other problems, this traditional classification of the continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic dialects]] can suggest stronger ties between dialects than is linguistically warranted. The Franconian group is a well known example of this, with [[East Frankish|East Franconian]] being much more closely related to [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] than it is to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], which is traditionally placed in the [[Low Franconian]] sub-grouping and with which it was thought to have had a common, tribal origin.<ref>{{lang|de|Hans-Werner Goetz: ''Die \u201eDeutschen St\u00e4mme\u201c als Forschungsproblem''.|italic=unset}} In: {{lang|de|Heinrich Beck, Dieter Geuenich, [[Heiko Steuer]], Dietrich Hakelberg}} (ed.): {{lang|de|Zur Geschichte der Gleichung \u201egermanisch-deutsch\u201c|italic=yes}}.

The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of [[phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] innovations not found in North and East Germanic.<ref name=Robinson>{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|title=Old English and Its Closest Relatives|isbn=0-8047-2221-8|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992}}</ref> The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (North Sea Germanic), [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]] (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and [[Irminones|Irminonic]] (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or that it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.<ref>[[Graeme Davis (mediaevalist)|Graeme Davis]] (2006:154) notes \"the languages of the Germanic group in the Old period are much closer than has previously been noted.

It is speculated that these tribes originally spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Bergakker runes.png|thumb|Bergakker inscription]]\nVery little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence (dating from around 425\u2013450&nbsp;AD) is on the [[Bergakker inscription|sword sheath of Bergakker]] which is either the singular direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD (that is described as the earliest sentence in [[Old Dutch]] as well) is found in the [[Lex Salica]]. This phrase was used to free a [[serfdom|serf]]:\n\n:\"Maltho thi afrio lito\"\n:(I say, I free you, half-free.)\n\nThese are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian.\n\n[[File:Les Francs en Belgique romaine.svg|thumb|300px|The location of the Franks around 475 . \"Les Francs rh\u00e9nans\" is the French term for \"Ripuarian Franks\".]]\nDuring this early period, the Franks were divided politically and geographically into two groups: the [[Salian Franks]] and the [[Ripuarian Franks]]. The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Salian Franks during this period is sometimes referred to as early \"Old Low Franconian\", and consisted of two groups: \"Old West Low Franconian\" and \"Old East Low Franconian\". The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] are referred to just as Old Franconian dialects (or, by some, as Old Frankish dialects).\n\nHowever, as already stated above, it may be more accurate to think of these dialects not as early Old Franconian but as Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic.\n\n===Frankish Empire (500\u2013900)===\n[[Image:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|300px|The Frankish conquests between 481 and 814]]\n\nAt around 500&nbsp;AD the Franks probably spoke a range of related dialects and languages rather than a single uniform dialect or language.<ref name=Green19>{{cite book |title=The continental Saxons from the migration period to the tenth century: an ethnographic perspective |editor-first=D.H. |editor-last=Green |editor2=Frank Siegmund |publisher=Woodbridge |location=Suffolk |year=2003 |series=Studies in historical archaeoethnology, v.6 |page=19 |quote=There has never been such a thing as one Franconian language.

The Franks united as a single group under Salian Frank leadership around 500 AD. Politically, the Ripuarian Franks existed as a separate group only until about 500&nbsp;AD, after which they were subsumed into the Salian Franks. The Franks were united, but the various Frankish groups must have continued to live in the same areas, and speak the same dialects, although as a part of the growing [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]].\n\nThere must have been a close relationship between the various Franconian dialects. There was also a close relationship between Old Low Franconian (i.e. Old Dutch) and its neighbouring [[Old Saxon]] and [[Old Frisian]] languages and dialects to the north and northeast, as well as the related [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon) dialects spoken in southern and eastern Britain.\n\nA widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\">Milis, L.J.R., \"A Long Beginning: The Low Countries Through the Tenth Century\" in J.C.H.

It is not known what they called their language, but it is possible that they always called it \"[[Diets]]\" (i.e. \"the people's language\"), or something similar.\n\nPhilologists think of [[Old Dutch]] and [[Old West Low Franconian]] as being the same language. However, sometimes reference is made to a transition from the language spoken by the Salian Franks to [[Old Dutch]]. The language spoken by the Salian Franks must have developed significantly during the seven centuries from 200 to 900 AD. At some point the language spoken by the Franks must have become identifiably Dutch. Because Franconian texts are almost non-existent and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, it is difficult to determine when such a transition occurred, but it is thought to have happened by the end of the 9th century and perhaps earlier. By 900&nbsp;AD the language spoken was recognisably an early form of Dutch, but that might also have been the case earlier.<ref name=\"Verhaal\">de Vries, Jan W., Roland Willemyns and Peter Burger, ''Het verhaal van een taal'', Amsterdam: Prometheus, 2003, pp. 12, 21\u201327. On page 25: \"''\u2026Een groot deel van het noorden van Frankrijk was in die tijd tweetalig Germaans-Romaans, en gedurende een paar eeuwen handhaafde het Germaans zich er. Maar in de zevende eeuw begon er opnieuw een romaniseringsbeweging en door de versmelting van beide volken werd de naam Franken voortaan ook gebezigd voor de Romanen ten noordern van de Loire. Frankisch of Fran\u00e7ois werd de naam de (Romaanse) taal. De nieuwe naam voor de Germaanse volkstaal hield hiermee verband: Diets of Duits, dat wil zeggen \"volks\", \"volkstaal\".'' [At that time a large part of the north of France was bilingual Germanic/Romance, and for a couple of centuries Germanic held its own. But in the seventh century a wave of romanisation began anew and because of the merging of the two peoples the name for the Franks was used for the Romance speakers north of the Loire. \"Frankonian/Frankish\" or \"Fran\u00e7ois\" became the name of the (Romance) language. The new name for the Germanic vernacular was related to this: \"Diets\"\" or \"Duits\", i.e. \"of the people\", \"the people's language\"]. Page 27: \"''\u2026Aan het einde van de negende eeuw kan er zeker van Nederlands gesproken worden; hoe long daarvoor dat ook het geval was, kan niet met zekerheid worden uitgemaakt.''\" [It can be said with certainty that Dutch was being spoken at the end of the 9th century; how long that might have been the case before that cannot be determined with certainty.]</ref> [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.

By this time the Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' in Germany and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Gaul===\nThe Franks expanded south into [[Gaul]]. Although the Franks would eventually conquer all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian apparently expanded in sufficient numbers only into northern Gaul to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory ([[Vulgar Latin]] and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Eventually, the Franks who had settled more to the south of this area in northern Gaul started adopting the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population. This [[Vulgar Latin]] language acquired the name of the people who came to speak it (Frankish or ''Fran\u00e7ais''); north of the French-Dutch language boundary, the language was no longer referred to as \"Frankish\" (if it ever was referred to as such) but rather came to be referred to as \"[[Diets]]\", i.e. the \"people's language\".<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> [[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|Urban T. Holmes]] has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.<ref>[[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|U. T. Holmes]], A. H. Schutz (1938), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbjX4ebc2lsC&pg=PA29 A History of the French Language]'', p. 29, Biblo & Tannen Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8196-0191-8}}</ref>\n\n===German Franconia===\n{{further|Franconia}}\nThe Franks also expanded their rule southeast into parts of Germany. Their language had some influence on local dialects, especially for terms relating to warfare. \nHowever, since the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, this unification did not lead to the development of a supra-regional variety of Franconian nor a standardized German language. At the same time that the Franks were expanding southeast into what is now southern Germany, there were linguistic changes taking place in the region. The [[High German consonant shift]] (or [[second Germanic consonant shift]]) was a phonological development ([[sound change]]) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases, probably beginning between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, and was almost complete before the earliest written records in the High German language were made in the 9th century. The resulting language, [[Old High German]], can be neatly contrasted with [[Low Franconian]], which for the most part did not experience the shift.\n\n==Franconian languages==\n{{main|Franconian languages}}\nThe set of dialects of the Franks who continued to live in their original territory in the Low Countries eventually developed in three different ways and eventually formed three modern branches of [[Franconian languages]].\n* The dialects spoken by the Salian Franks in the Low Countries ([[Old Dutch]], also referred to as [[Old West Low Franconian]]) developed into the [[Dutch language]], which itself has a number of distinct dialects. [[Afrikaans]] developed from early [[Modern Dutch]]'s [[Hollandic dialect]] spoken in the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].\n* The [[Old East Low Franconian]] dialects are represented today in [[Limburgish]]. Old Limburgish continued to develop under heavy [[Low Rhenish]] and Dutch influence which gradually made it more mutually intelligible with neighboring varieties. Since the incorporation of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] into the Dutch state in the late 16th century, Limburgish has experienced heavy influence from Dutch, to point where the two are today [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] to a significant degree. Modern Limburgish is therefore variously classified as either a separate language or a distinct dialect of Dutch, as is the case in Dutch linguistics. In [[German linguistics]], Limburgish is considered a [[Low Rhenish]] or [[Meuse-Rhenish]] dialect, along with [[Luxembourgish]]. Limburgish itself has a number of dialects.\n* It is speculated that the dialects originally spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in Germany possibly developed into, or were subsumed under, the German dialects called the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian Franconian]], [[Moselle Franconian]] and [[Rhenish Franconian]]). These languages and dialects were later affected by serious language changes (such as the [[High German consonant shift]]), which resulted in the emergence of dialects that are now considered German dialects. Today, the Central Franconian dialects are spoken in the core territory of the Ripuarian Franks. Although there may not be definite proof to say that the dialects of the Ripuarian Franks (about which very little is known) developed into the [[Central Franconian dialects]], there are\u2014apart from mere probability\u2014some pieces of evidence, most importantly the development ''-hs'' \u2192 ''ss'' and the loss of ''n'' before spirants, which is found throughout Central Franconian but nowhere else in [[High German]]. Compare Luxembourgish ''Uess'' (\"ox\"), Dutch ''os'', German ''Ochse''; and (dated) Luxembourgish ''Gaus'' (\"goose\"), Old Dutch ''g\u0101s'', German ''Gans''. The language spoken by [[Charlemagne]] was probably the dialect that later developed into the Ripuarian Franconian dialect.<ref>{{cite journal | first=R.E. | last=Keller | title=The Language of the Franks | journal=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library of Manchester | volume=47 |number=1 | year=1964 | pages=101\u2013122, esp. 122}} {{cite book | first=W.W. | last=Chambers | first2=J.R. | last2=Wilkie | title=A short history of the German language | year=1970 | location=London | publisher=Methuen | page=33}} {{harvnb|McKitterick|2008|p=318}}.</ref>\n\nThe Frankish Empire later extended throughout neighbouring France and Germany. The language of the Franks had some influence on the local languages (especially in France), but never took hold as a standard language because Latin was the international language at the time. However, the language of the Franks did not develop into the [[lingua franca]].\n\nThe Franks conquered adjoining territories of Germany (including the territory of the [[Allemanni]]). The Frankish legacy survives in these areas, for example, in the names of the city of [[Frankfurt]] and the area of [[Franconia]]. \nThe Franks brought their language with them from their original territory and, as in France, it must have had an effect on the local dialects and languages. However, it is relatively difficult for linguists today to determine what features of these dialects are due to Frankish influence, because the latter was in large parts obscured, or even overwhelmed, by later developments.\n\n==Influence on Old French and Middle Latin==\nMost [[List of French words of Germanic origin|French words of Germanic origin]] came from Frankish often replacing the [[Latin]] word which would have been used. It is estimated that modern French took approximately 1000 stem words from Old Franconian.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508379/Romance-languages/74738/Vocabulary-variations?anchor=ref603727</ref> Many of these words were concerned with agriculture (e.g. {{lang-fr|jardin}} \"garden\"), war (e.g. {{lang-fr|guerre}} \"war\") or social organization (e.g. {{lang-fr|baron}} \"baron\"). Old Franconian has introduced the modern French word for the nation, [[France]] ([[Francia]]), meaning \"land of the Franks\". The hypothesis by which the name for the Paris region, [[\u00cele-de-France]] was also given by the Franks<ref>BFM (2017) Pourquoi l\u2019\u00eel-de-France s\u2019appelle elle l\u2019\u00cee de France ?, https://www.bfmtv.com/culture/pourquoi-l-ile-de-france-s-appelle-t-elle-l-ile-de-france-1311110.html</ref> based on the reinterpretation of PG *lutilaz 'small' is phonetically implausible since the ninth-century ''Pariser Gespr\u00e4che'' clearly indicates ''luzzil'' glossed ''paru[um]'' 'small' as the local pronunciation.<ref>Zuk, Fabian (2018) Gued est Taz? Phonologie et lexique du vieux bilinguisme franco-germanique, University of Lyon.</ref>{{dubious|reason=That's just the Old High German pronunciation, but not all of Frankish was High German|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe influence of Franconian on French is decisive for the birth of the early [[langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'o\u00efl]] compared to the other [[Romance languages]], that appeared later such as [[Occitan language|Langue d'oc]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], etc., because its influence was greater than the respective influence of [[Gothic language|Visigothic]] and [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]] (both [[Germanic languages]]) on the ''langue d'oc'', the Romance languages of Iberia, and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Not all of these loanwords have been retained in modern French. French has also passed on words of Franconian origin to other Romance languages, and to English.\n\nOld Franconian has also left many [[etymon|etyma]] in the different Northern [[Langues d'o\u00efl]]s such as [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]], Bas-[[Lorrain dialect|Lorrain]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]], more than in Common French, and not always the same ones.<ref>[[:wa:Etimolodjeye francike#Djiv\u00eaye di mots walons d' etimolodjeye francike|See a list of Walloon names derived from Old Franconian]].</ref>\n\nSee below a non-exhaustive list of French words of Frankish origin. An asterisk prefixing a term indicates a [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed form]] of the Frankish word. Most Franconian words with the phoneme ''w'' changed it to ''gu'' when entering Old French and other [[Romance languages]]; however, the northern [[langue d'o\u00efl]] dialects such as Picard, Northern Norman, Walloon, Burgundian, Champenois and Bas-Lorrain retained the [w] or turned it into [v]. Perhaps the best known example is the Franconian *''werra'' (\"war\" < Old Northern French ''werre'', compare Old High German ''werre'' \"quarrel\"), which entered modern French as ''guerre'' and ''guerra'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Other examples include \"gant\" (\"gauntlet\", from *''want'') and \"garder\" (\"to guard\", from *''ward\u014dn''). Franconian words starting with ''s'' before another consonant developed it into ''es''- (e.g. Franconian ''skirm'' and Old French ''escremie'' > Old Italian ''scrimia'' > Modern French ''escrime'').<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/escrime CNRTL, \"escrime\"]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, a number of modern [[French language|French]] words and place names, including the country name \"France\", have a Frankish (i.e. [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) origin. France itself is still known by terms meaning the \"[[Frankish Realm]]\" in languages such as [[German language|German]] ({{lang|de|[[wikt:Frankreich|Frankreich]]}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ({{lang|nl|[[wikt:Frankrijk|Frankrijk]]}}), the derived [[Afrikaans]] ({{lang|af|[[wikt:Frankryk|Frankryk]]}}), and [[Danish language|Danish]] ({{lang|da|[[wikt:Frankrig|Frankrig]]}}).\n\nBetween the 5th and 9th centuries, Frankish spoken by the [[Salian Franks]] in present-day Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into [[Old Low Franconian]] (also known as [[Old Dutch]]), whereas Frankish spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] (also known as Rhineland Franks) evolved into the Franconian dialects of [[Old High German]] (later the [[Central Franconian]] and [[Rhine Franconian]] dialects of the [[German Language|German]] and [[Luxembourgish]] languages).\n\nThe Old Frankish language is poorly attested and mostly reconstructed from Frankish loanwords in [[Old French]], and from Old Dutch, as recorded in the 6th to 12th centuries. A notable exception is the [[Bergakker inscription]], which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{main|Name of the Franks}}\n[[Germanic philology]] and [[German studies]] have their origins in the first half of the 19th century when [[Romanticism]] and Romantic thought heavily influenced the lexicon of the [[linguist]]s and [[philologist]]s of the time, including pivotal figures such as the [[Brothers Grimm]]. As a result, many contemporary linguists tried to incorporate their findings in an already existing historical framework of \"[[stem duchies]]\" and {{lang|de|Altst\u00e4mme}} (lit. \"old tribes\", i.e. the six Germanic tribes then thought to have formed the \"German nation\" in the traditional German nationalism of the elites) resulting in a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] which spoke of \"[[Bavarii|Bavarian]]\", \"[[Saxons|Saxon]]\", \"[[Frisii|Frisian]]\", \"[[Thuringii|Thuringian]]\", \"[[Suebi|Swabian]]\" and \"[[Franks|Frankish]]\" dialects. While this nomenclature became generally accepted in traditional Germanic philology, it has also been described as \"inherently inaccurate\" as these ancient ethnic boundaries (as understood in the 19th century) bore little or limited resemblance to the actual or historical linguistic situation of the Germanic languages. Among other problems, this traditional classification of the continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic dialects]] can suggest stronger ties between dialects than is linguistically warranted. The Franconian group is a well known example of this, with [[East Frankish|East Franconian]] being much more closely related to [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] than it is to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], which is traditionally placed in the [[Low Franconian]] sub-grouping and with which it was thought to have had a common, tribal origin.<ref>{{lang|de|Hans-Werner Goetz: ''Die \u201eDeutschen St\u00e4mme\u201c als Forschungsproblem''.|italic=unset}} In: {{lang|de|Heinrich Beck, Dieter Geuenich, [[Heiko Steuer]], Dietrich Hakelberg}} (ed.): {{lang|de|Zur Geschichte der Gleichung \u201egermanisch-deutsch\u201c|italic=yes}}.

While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or that it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.<ref>[[Graeme Davis (mediaevalist)|Graeme Davis]] (2006:154) notes \"the languages of the Germanic group in the Old period are much closer than has previously been noted.

It is speculated that these tribes originally spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Bergakker runes.png|thumb|Bergakker inscription]]\nVery little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence (dating from around 425\u2013450&nbsp;AD) is on the [[Bergakker inscription|sword sheath of Bergakker]] which is either the singular direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD (that is described as the earliest sentence in [[Old Dutch]] as well) is found in the [[Lex Salica]]. This phrase was used to free a [[serfdom|serf]]:\n\n:\"Maltho thi afrio lito\"\n:(I say, I free you, half-free.)\n\nThese are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian.\n\n[[File:Les Francs en Belgique romaine.svg|thumb|300px|The location of the Franks around 475 . \"Les Francs rh\u00e9nans\" is the French term for \"Ripuarian Franks\".]]\nDuring this early period, the Franks were divided politically and geographically into two groups: the [[Salian Franks]] and the [[Ripuarian Franks]].

The Franks united as a single group under Salian Frank leadership around 500 AD. Politically, the Ripuarian Franks existed as a separate group only until about 500&nbsp;AD, after which they were subsumed into the Salian Franks. The Franks were united, but the various Frankish groups must have continued to live in the same areas, and speak the same dialects, although as a part of the growing [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]].\n\nThere must have been a close relationship between the various Franconian dialects. There was also a close relationship between Old Low Franconian (i.e. Old Dutch) and its neighbouring [[Old Saxon]] and [[Old Frisian]] languages and dialects to the north and northeast, as well as the related [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon) dialects spoken in southern and eastern Britain.\n\nA widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\">Milis, L.J.R., \"A Long Beginning: The Low Countries Through the Tenth Century\" in J.C.H.

It is not known what they called their language, but it is possible that they always called it \"[[Diets]]\" (i.e. \"the people's language\"), or something similar.\n\nPhilologists think of [[Old Dutch]] and [[Old West Low Franconian]] as being the same language. However, sometimes reference is made to a transition from the language spoken by the Salian Franks to [[Old Dutch]]. The language spoken by the Salian Franks must have developed significantly during the seven centuries from 200 to 900 AD. At some point the language spoken by the Franks must have become identifiably Dutch. Because Franconian texts are almost non-existent and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, it is difficult to determine when such a transition occurred, but it is thought to have happened by the end of the 9th century and perhaps earlier. By 900&nbsp;AD the language spoken was recognisably an early form of Dutch, but that might also have been the case earlier.<ref name=\"Verhaal\">de Vries, Jan W., Roland Willemyns and Peter Burger, ''Het verhaal van een taal'', Amsterdam: Prometheus, 2003, pp. 12, 21\u201327. On page 25: \"''\u2026Een groot deel van het noorden van Frankrijk was in die tijd tweetalig Germaans-Romaans, en gedurende een paar eeuwen handhaafde het Germaans zich er. Maar in de zevende eeuw begon er opnieuw een romaniseringsbeweging en door de versmelting van beide volken werd de naam Franken voortaan ook gebezigd voor de Romanen ten noordern van de Loire. Frankisch of Fran\u00e7ois werd de naam de (Romaanse) taal. De nieuwe naam voor de Germaanse volkstaal hield hiermee verband: Diets of Duits, dat wil zeggen \"volks\", \"volkstaal\".'' [At that time a large part of the north of France was bilingual Germanic/Romance, and for a couple of centuries Germanic held its own. But in the seventh century a wave of romanisation began anew and because of the merging of the two peoples the name for the Franks was used for the Romance speakers north of the Loire. \"Frankonian/Frankish\" or \"Fran\u00e7ois\" became the name of the (Romance) language. The new name for the Germanic vernacular was related to this: \"Diets\"\" or \"Duits\", i.e. \"of the people\", \"the people's language\"]. Page 27: \"''\u2026Aan het einde van de negende eeuw kan er zeker van Nederlands gesproken worden; hoe long daarvoor dat ook het geval was, kan niet met zekerheid worden uitgemaakt.''\" [It can be said with certainty that Dutch was being spoken at the end of the 9th century; how long that might have been the case before that cannot be determined with certainty.]</ref> [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence (but this was originally south of where it is today).<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/><ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> Even though living in the original territory of the Franks, these Franks seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time the Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' in Germany and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Gaul===\nThe Franks expanded south into [[Gaul]]. Although the Franks would eventually conquer all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian apparently expanded in sufficient numbers only into northern Gaul to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory ([[Vulgar Latin]] and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Eventually, the Franks who had settled more to the south of this area in northern Gaul started adopting the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population. This [[Vulgar Latin]] language acquired the name of the people who came to speak it (Frankish or ''Fran\u00e7ais''); north of the French-Dutch language boundary, the language was no longer referred to as \"Frankish\" (if it ever was referred to as such) but rather came to be referred to as \"[[Diets]]\", i.e. the \"people's language\".<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> [[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|Urban T. Holmes]] has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.<ref>[[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|U. T. Holmes]], A. H. Schutz (1938), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbjX4ebc2lsC&pg=PA29 A History of the French Language]'', p. 29, Biblo & Tannen Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8196-0191-8}}</ref>\n\n===German Franconia===\n{{further|Franconia}}\nThe Franks also expanded their rule southeast into parts of Germany. Their language had some influence on local dialects, especially for terms relating to warfare. \nHowever, since the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, this unification did not lead to the development of a supra-regional variety of Franconian nor a standardized German language. At the same time that the Franks were expanding southeast into what is now southern Germany, there were linguistic changes taking place in the region. The [[High German consonant shift]] (or [[second Germanic consonant shift]]) was a phonological development ([[sound change]]) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases, probably beginning between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, and was almost complete before the earliest written records in the High German language were made in the 9th century. The resulting language, [[Old High German]], can be neatly contrasted with [[Low Franconian]], which for the most part did not experience the shift.\n\n==Franconian languages==\n{{main|Franconian languages}}\nThe set of dialects of the Franks who continued to live in their original territory in the Low Countries eventually developed in three different ways and eventually formed three modern branches of [[Franconian languages]].\n* The dialects spoken by the Salian Franks in the Low Countries ([[Old Dutch]], also referred to as [[Old West Low Franconian]]) developed into the [[Dutch language]], which itself has a number of distinct dialects. [[Afrikaans]] developed from early [[Modern Dutch]]'s [[Hollandic dialect]] spoken in the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].\n* The [[Old East Low Franconian]] dialects are represented today in [[Limburgish]]. Old Limburgish continued to develop under heavy [[Low Rhenish]] and Dutch influence which gradually made it more mutually intelligible with neighboring varieties. Since the incorporation of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] into the Dutch state in the late 16th century, Limburgish has experienced heavy influence from Dutch, to point where the two are today [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] to a significant degree. Modern Limburgish is therefore variously classified as either a separate language or a distinct dialect of Dutch, as is the case in Dutch linguistics. In [[German linguistics]], Limburgish is considered a [[Low Rhenish]] or [[Meuse-Rhenish]] dialect, along with [[Luxembourgish]]. Limburgish itself has a number of dialects.\n* It is speculated that the dialects originally spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in Germany possibly developed into, or were subsumed under, the German dialects called the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian Franconian]], [[Moselle Franconian]] and [[Rhenish Franconian]]). These languages and dialects were later affected by serious language changes (such as the [[High German consonant shift]]), which resulted in the emergence of dialects that are now considered German dialects. Today, the Central Franconian dialects are spoken in the core territory of the Ripuarian Franks. Although there may not be definite proof to say that the dialects of the Ripuarian Franks (about which very little is known) developed into the [[Central Franconian dialects]], there are\u2014apart from mere probability\u2014some pieces of evidence, most importantly the development ''-hs'' \u2192 ''ss'' and the loss of ''n'' before spirants, which is found throughout Central Franconian but nowhere else in [[High German]]. Compare Luxembourgish ''Uess'' (\"ox\"), Dutch ''os'', German ''Ochse''; and (dated) Luxembourgish ''Gaus'' (\"goose\"), Old Dutch ''g\u0101s'', German ''Gans''. The language spoken by [[Charlemagne]] was probably the dialect that later developed into the Ripuarian Franconian dialect.<ref>{{cite journal | first=R.E. | last=Keller | title=The Language of the Franks | journal=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library of Manchester | volume=47 |number=1 | year=1964 | pages=101\u2013122, esp. 122}} {{cite book | first=W.W. | last=Chambers | first2=J.R. | last2=Wilkie | title=A short history of the German language | year=1970 | location=London | publisher=Methuen | page=33}} {{harvnb|McKitterick|2008|p=318}}.</ref>\n\nThe Frankish Empire later extended throughout neighbouring France and Germany. The language of the Franks had some influence on the local languages (especially in France), but never took hold as a standard language because Latin was the international language at the time. However, the language of the Franks did not develop into the [[lingua franca]].\n\nThe Franks conquered adjoining territories of Germany (including the territory of the [[Allemanni]]). The Frankish legacy survives in these areas, for example, in the names of the city of [[Frankfurt]] and the area of [[Franconia]]. \nThe Franks brought their language with them from their original territory and, as in France, it must have had an effect on the local dialects and languages. However, it is relatively difficult for linguists today to determine what features of these dialects are due to Frankish influence, because the latter was in large parts obscured, or even overwhelmed, by later developments.\n\n==Influence on Old French and Middle Latin==\nMost [[List of French words of Germanic origin|French words of Germanic origin]] came from Frankish often replacing the [[Latin]] word which would have been used. It is estimated that modern French took approximately 1000 stem words from Old Franconian.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508379/Romance-languages/74738/Vocabulary-variations?anchor=ref603727</ref> Many of these words were concerned with agriculture (e.g. {{lang-fr|jardin}} \"garden\"), war (e.g. {{lang-fr|guerre}} \"war\") or social organization (e.g. {{lang-fr|baron}} \"baron\"). Old Franconian has introduced the modern French word for the nation, [[France]] ([[Francia]]), meaning \"land of the Franks\". The hypothesis by which the name for the Paris region, [[\u00cele-de-France]] was also given by the Franks<ref>BFM (2017) Pourquoi l\u2019\u00eel-de-France s\u2019appelle elle l\u2019\u00cee de France ?, https://www.bfmtv.com/culture/pourquoi-l-ile-de-france-s-appelle-t-elle-l-ile-de-france-1311110.html</ref> based on the reinterpretation of PG *lutilaz 'small' is phonetically implausible since the ninth-century ''Pariser Gespr\u00e4che'' clearly indicates ''luzzil'' glossed ''paru[um]'' 'small' as the local pronunciation.<ref>Zuk, Fabian (2018) Gued est Taz? Phonologie et lexique du vieux bilinguisme franco-germanique, University of Lyon.</ref>{{dubious|reason=That's just the Old High German pronunciation, but not all of Frankish was High German|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe influence of Franconian on French is decisive for the birth of the early [[langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'o\u00efl]] compared to the other [[Romance languages]], that appeared later such as [[Occitan language|Langue d'oc]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], etc., because its influence was greater than the respective influence of [[Gothic language|Visigothic]] and [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]] (both [[Germanic languages]]) on the ''langue d'oc'', the Romance languages of Iberia, and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Not all of these loanwords have been retained in modern French. French has also passed on words of Franconian origin to other Romance languages, and to English.\n\nOld Franconian has also left many [[etymon|etyma]] in the different Northern [[Langues d'o\u00efl]]s such as [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]], Bas-[[Lorrain dialect|Lorrain]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]], more than in Common French, and not always the same ones.<ref>[[:wa:Etimolodjeye francike#Djiv\u00eaye di mots walons d' etimolodjeye francike|See a list of Walloon names derived from Old Franconian]].</ref>\n\nSee below a non-exhaustive list of French words of Frankish origin. An asterisk prefixing a term indicates a [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed form]] of the Frankish word. Most Franconian words with the phoneme ''w'' changed it to ''gu'' when entering Old French and other [[Romance languages]]; however, the northern [[langue d'o\u00efl]] dialects such as Picard, Northern Norman, Walloon, Burgundian, Champenois and Bas-Lorrain retained the [w] or turned it into [v]. Perhaps the best known example is the Franconian *''werra'' (\"war\" < Old Northern French ''werre'', compare Old High German ''werre'' \"quarrel\"), which entered modern French as ''guerre'' and ''guerra'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Other examples include \"gant\" (\"gauntlet\", from *''want'') and \"garder\" (\"to guard\", from *''ward\u014dn''). Franconian words starting with ''s'' before another consonant developed it into ''es''- (e.g. Franconian ''skirm'' and Old French ''escremie'' > Old Italian ''scrimia'' > Modern French ''escrime'').<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/escrime CNRTL, \"escrime\"]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]], the Engineer\u2013in\u2013Chief of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], and built from 1862 to 1867 by William Piper, Peto Brassey and Betts (superstructure), William Watkins (piers). It is also known as '''Victoria Bridge''', '''The Nepean Bridge''' and '''RTA Bridge No. 333'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016.<ref name=nswshr-1950>{{cite NSW SHR|5060797|Victoria Bridge|hr=01950|fn=EF14/22755|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge initially carried rail and [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse\u2013drawn traffic]], and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by [[Roads and Maritime Services]]. The bridge is the oldest surviving crossing of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]\u2013Nepean River. As at 2009, Roads and Maritime Services estimated that Victoria Bridge carried an average daily traffic of 25,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=RMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |title=Victoria Bridge |work=Road Projects |publisher=Roads and Maritime Services |date=October 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321061610/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1856 travelers who wished to cross the [[Nepean River]] were required to use either the Emu Ford or a punt that was located south of the present day Victoria Bridge on Punt Road. This arrangement meant that in times of flood, travellers were often delayed at Penrith for days or even weeks waiting to cross the river. A small village developed near Emu Ford to cater to the people waiting to cross the river. With the discovery of gold west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] the flow of people, produce and animals through Penrith and across the river increased dramatically. It was no coincidence that attempts were made to build a permanent structure across the river, resulting in two timber road bridges located near to the eventual Victoria Bridge site being constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nPrior to the construction of the Victoria Bridge, a punt service was located at the site of the bridge. Following the discovery of gold in the west of the Great Dividing Range demand for a permanent river crossing increased. A timber bridge was constructed with private funds, charging a toll for its use.\n\nIn 1850 the [[Government of New South Wales|Government]], reacting to lobbying by Penrith locals,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228775622 |title=NOTICE is hereby given, that an application will he made to His Excellency the |newspaper=[[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=55 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 April 1850 |page=693 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> passed an Act authorising the construction of a bridge at the western end of Jamison Road. This scheme never went ahead. A second Act was passed in 1851 authorising the formation of a company, allocating [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]6,000 for the construction of the bridge and allowing for the collection of tolls on the bridge. Following this act the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was formed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230769800 |title=An Act to Incorporate a Company to be called the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company, and to enable the said Company to erect and maintain a Bridge over the River Nepean at Penrith, in direct continuation of the present line of the Great Western Road, and to take Toll thereat for a term of years; and for other purposes therein mentioned.

The first directors of the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company were local entrepreneurs Robert Fitzgerald, James Thomas Ryan, Edwin Rouse, John Perry, Charles York, Henry Hall, Alexander Fraser. Construction of the bridge was under the supervision of David McBeth, a Scottish surveyor.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge, completed in December 1855, was {{convert|700|ft|m|0|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, becoming the first bridge across the Nepean River in the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60171836 |title=OPENING OF THE PENRITH VICTORIA BRIDGE. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]] |issue=1554 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=2 January 1856 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> McBeth received a A\u00a3200 bonus on top of his A\u00a3300 salary for the timely completion of the works, the toll rights for the first year were sold by the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company for A\u00a32,250 and traffic flowed across the bridge.

In August 1857 a flood carried away the four centre spans, no doubt due to the poor security of the mid-stream timber piles which reportedly were frayed like mop heads where McBeth had attempted to drive them into rock. McBeth had lacked experience and knowledge in bridge building and although the piles close to the bank went in easily, the mid-stream timber piles had struck rock and failed to achieve a secure penetration.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe Penrith Nepean Bridge Company decided to rebuild the bridge and employed an engineer named Moriarty to supervise the works. The construction contract was awarded to William Lockhart for A\u00a39,000. The piles that remained from the first bridge were utilised in the new bridge design, against the advice of both Lockhart and Moriarty. The new bridge was of a different, stronger design than the first and construction was completed in good time with the toll rights for one year selling for A\u00a32,850. The bridge withstood its first flood, but in 1860 the most devastating flood in New South Wales history until that time washed away the entire superstructure and deposited it on a bank down river. The structure was almost intact. Had the piles been replaced as originally suggested by the engineer and builder, the bridge might well have survived the flood. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was ruined by the destruction of the bridge and the directors lost large sums of money. Following the destruction of this second bridge the Government supplied two punts to convey people and goods across the river. The punts were irreparably damaged by a flood in 1867.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe loss of the punts coincided with a period in which the Great Western Railway was in the advanced planning stages, including plans for the construction of a bridge over the Nepean River to link Penrith with [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in the west, as part of the Penrith to Weatherboard Line (later [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]]). It was decided that the required bridge would carry both a railway line and a single lane of road over the river, as a temporary solution.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Construction ==\nVictoria Bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways in NSW, [[John Whitton]] and checked in Britain by his brother-in-law and renowned railway engineer, [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]]. Victoria Bridge was designed to carry two railway tracks as it was intended that the road on the bridge be only a temporary arrangement. The flood of 1860 that had carried off the previous bridge influenced Whitton to raise the bridge deck by {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} after witnessing the power of high flood waters.<ref name=nswshr-1950/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13149766 |title=THE NEPEAN |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=LV |issue=9074 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 June 1867 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the bridge uses half through girders which are actually tall boxes made of riveted [[wrought iron]] plates was driven by the need to keep the underside of the bridge as shallow as possible to maximise headroom for flood clearance. The configuration of their boxes with their tall web plates, and upper box for lateral stability, reflected cutting edge design for the period. It utilised cutting edge of structural technology, using principles developed by Robert Stephenson in his design of the [[Britannia Bridge]] and the [[Conwy Railway Bridge]] in Wales; Thomas Telford and others who, by testing and theoretical work, developed techniques to prevent plate buckling by providing frequent vertical stiffeners, and sideways buckling of girders members by adding torsionally stiff boxes at the top and bottom. The first deep box girder bridge was designed by Stephenson and built across the [[Menai Strait]] in 1850. It was provided with suspension towers in case the deck was insufficiently strong and stiff, but the cables were never installed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe construction contract for Victoria Bridge was split into several parts. One contract for the construction of the piers was awarded to William Tyler in 1862. He commenced work but flooding in 1863 and 1864 damaged his equipment and contributed to his abandonment of the contract in August 1864. The contract was subsequently awarded to W. Watkins for the sum of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]44,658. He completed the work before the agreed completion date and avoided the A\u00a350 per week penalty he would have incurred had he not delivered on time.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe ironwork for the bridge was supplied by Peto, Brassey and Betts of [[Birkenhead, England]] for A\u00a341,750. The same firm had supplied the ironwork for the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] constructed on the Nepean River in 1863 and now the oldest surviving bridge on the NSW railway system. The timber approach viaduct for the Victoria Bridge was constructed by Mr Baillie at a cost of A\u00a38,716. Other small contracts for earthworks were also made bringing the total cost of the {{convert|1100|t|ST|0|adj=on}} iron bridge to approximately A\u00a3110,000.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nHigh floodwaters struck again soon after the bridge was opened in 1867, when the highest flood recorded until that time damaged the western timber approaches and washed away a portion of the spans and river bank. The main span however withstood this first major test and the flood waters did not reach the underside of the deck. A result of this flood a portion of the damaged timber viaduct was replaced by a shorter wrought iron box-girder span manufactured by the Thames Iron Company, [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[London]]. The bridge was in operation as a rail bridge during the repair works and was re-opened to road traffic in 1869. The Victoria Bridge was considered to be of such modern design that it was featured in the \"Modern Examples of Road and Railway Bridges\" by Maw and Dredge in 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}\n\nVictoria Bridge had a significant impact on the local economy. Prior to its opening Penrith station formed the rail head of the western line, making Penrith a trade hub. The introduction of the road across the Nepean River diminished the business in the town previously brought in by travellers delayed in Penrith by poor river conditions. Conversely the opening of the bridge and the road and railway to the west enabled the growth of centres west of the mountains and the tourist industry of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to become established.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nFollowing the increase in rail traffic on the Great Western Railway and the increase in the weight of locomotive engines, options were considered for the duplication of the railway line and of the Victoria Bridge. The possibility of using Victoria Bridge to carry two rail lines was considered. But this would have required the strengthening of the bridge by constructing intermediate piers between the existing piers of the bridge, thus halving the length of the spans. This technique had been applied to Victoria Bridge's sister structure the Menangle Bridge in 1907. It was however decided that the construction of a second bridge alongside the Victoria Bridge would be more appropriate and construction on a steel truss bridge was undertaken. The piers of the new bridge lined up with Victoria Bridge's existing piers in an attempt to minimise stresses on the structures during high river flows. In 1907 the railway bridge that now stands alongside Victoria Bridge was completed. With its completion the Victoria Bridge was converted to carry two lanes of traffic and a footway while the new bridge carried two rail lines.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> Originally it took one railway line and a road across the river, however in 1907 another bridge was constructed a few metres to the north which thenceforth took two railway lines across the river, and the original bridge reverted to road and pedestrian use only.<ref name=RTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |title=Victoria Bridge over Nepean River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority |accessdate=19 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902224229/https://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1930s the timber approach spans of the bridge were discovered to be heavily deteriorated through termite attack and the approach spans were replaced with reinforced concrete trestles and a concrete deck supported by [[rolled steel joist]]s (RSJs).<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe site of Victoria Bridge has long been a centre of recreation in the Penrith region. From the 1850s it has been used for national and international rowing competitions.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> The bridge is significant in the development of the colony of NSW as it allowed the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|railway]], which previously terminated at Penrith, to reach the Railway Blue Mountains and beyond, as well as providing continuous road passage across the river using the Great Western Highway.<ref name=RTA/>\n\n==Current use==\nToday the bridge's significance as a road route to and from the Blue Mountains is diminished. The [[M4 Western Motorway]] has replaced the Great Western Highway as the main arterial route, crossing the Nepean River at [[Regentville, New South Wales|Regentville]]. The M4 and the Great Western Highway join/separate at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone Hill]].\n\nThe bridge maintains its significance as a local tourist attraction and a centrepiece to sporting events along the Nepean River, as well as continuing to serve as vital link between the suburbs west of the Nepean, such as Emu Plains, and the major suburban centre of Penrith. The 1907 railway bridge still takes the Main Western and Blue Mountains railway lines over the river.\n\nAn undivided pedestrian pathway approximately {{convert|1.3|m}} is located adjacent to the roadway. Following community advocacy,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |title=It's time for a safe crossing of the Nepean River at Victoria Bridge |work=Fix Victoria Bridge |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023121/http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |archive-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> in 2010, Roads and Maritime Services commenced a feasibility study into a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway over the bridge.<ref name=RMS/> By mid-2016 Roads and Maritime Services contracted Seymour Whyte Constructions Pty Ltd to build a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Nepean River, south of the Victoria Bridge, to connect Penrith and Emu Plains.

The three main girders, each spanning a clear {{convert|56.7|m}}, were designed and constructed as one {{convert|181|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-long}} continuous structure (no separations over the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]), a novel structural feature for 1867.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}} This structure, supported by hollow stone piers at {{convert|60.35|m}} centres, has iron cross girders which support a concrete deck, {{convert|3.5|m}} below the tops of the main girders which are {{convert|3.95|m}} deep. Each [[Span (architecture)|span]] has a camber of {{convert|100|mm}}. There is a secondary, shorter, shallower, simply-supported girder, {{convert|41.1|m}} long at the western (Emu Plains) end of the bridge. All four iron girders have pairs of hollow boxes top and bottom separated by two web plates, an early version of box-girder construction. They are all of riveted construction. The total weight of [[wrought iron]] is approximately {{convert|1100|t|ST|0}}.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge consists of three main spans of iron box girder, one secondary span of iron box girder and three concrete approach spans on either side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe piers that support the main spans are constructed of [[Sydney sandstone]], the pier supporting the western end of the secondary iron girder span is constructed of mass concrete. The piers supporting the approach spans are constructed of concrete trestle frames. Piped services are supported under the pedestrian walkway portion of the deck and a large pipe is supported on the top flange of one of the main girders.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nT-section shaped stiffeners can be seen running vertically down the sides of the girders at the bearing ends. There are five stiffeners over the central piers and three over outer piers. Stiffeners prevent the thin web plates from buckling vertically.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nArchitectural curved angle sections appear on the outer face of the girders of the main span. These serve no structural function but \"lighten the appearance of the structure\"<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are flood markers on the side of the easternmost sandstone pier. The remnants of old light posts can be seen on the piers on the northern side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are modern street light posts and lights on the southern piers of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 1 December 2008, the fabric of the bridge is generally in very good condition. There is little sign of rust on iron elements and concrete and stone elements also appear to be in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe remains of the piles of the earlier bridges may still be embedded in the riverbed. There is also the possibility that relics of the construction platforms, crane bases or [[coffer]] damns used to construct Victoria Bridge may be found in the riverbed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1869 - Western approach spans were rebuilt following damage of the original timber approach spans by flood two weeks after the bridge was opened. The new spans were of a similar design to the main spans but with cast iron caisson piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*{{circa|1870}}-90 - The original road surface was close-fitting timber planking, wheel guides were installed early in the life of the bridge to help horse and bullock drawn vehicles drive in a straight line on the timber boards.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1883 - a galvanised iron fence was installed between the single railway track and the single lane road portion of the bridge. Around this time a warning bell was also installed to warn of approaching trains. This was installed after several incidents on the bridge involving livestock on the bridge being disturbed by passing trains.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1907 - new double track railway bridge was opened and the single railway line was removed from Victoria Bridge. The deck was also reconstructed to accommodate two lanes of traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1934 - Approach spans and abutments reconstructed in steel and concrete<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*19?? - The footway across the main spans reconstructed to provide for utility pipes.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 18 March 2015, Victoria Bridge is of state heritage significance as one of only three bridges of its type that were ever constructed in NSW, of which only two remain ('wrought iron-through girder'). Although two bridges of this type still remain, Victoria Bridge is unique in NSW due to the intactness of its form compared to Menangle bridge, which has undergone significant alterations to its structural form through the addition of intermediate piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria bridge represents a type of bridge that was considered to be the cutting edge of technology when it was designed in 1862. Design principles used in Victoria Bridge were pioneered by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and The Conwy Bridge in Britain. In addition to this prestigious design history, Victoria Bridge has the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge is of state significance due to its role in bridging the Nepean River for the Great Western Railway. Victoria Bridge was a key element in bringing the railways to western NSW. The bridge's association with the designer of the Great Western Railway, John Whitton is also of significance.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria Bridge (Penrith) was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its historical role as a vital element in the development of key road and rail transport routes across NSW from the 1860s and 1870s. In particular this includes the Great Western Railway line which opened up the western regions of the NSW, and made a significant contribution to improving trade flow across the state. As a road bridge it places a significant role in the story of crossing of the flood prone Nepean River, and was the first successful bridge crossing at Penrith. In addition to the wider advantages the bridge brought for transport across the state, it also has local significance for its economically on local workers and economies.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its association with its designer John Whitton, Engineer-in Chief for the NSW Railways, who also designed the Great Western Railway and the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] and [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]]. Mr Whitton was an outstanding engineer of his time and was also responsible for overseeing construction of the bridge and the railway line between Penrith and Wentworth Falls. It is also associated with the renowned British engineer John Fowler, of Firth of Forth Bridge Fame, who checked Whitton's design and plans and supervised the fabrication of the bridge in England.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state aesthetic significance because its design was based on important principles pioneered by Robert Stephenson on the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Bridge in Wales. It is the most intact of only two iron through girder bridges built in NSW. Menangle Bridge now has intermediate piers and so no longer has its original form. Victoria Bridge is the only one of its type still operating with the same structural system that it was built with. The bridge has been an important landmark in Penrith since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has state technical and aesthetic significance. Whitton's design employed the latest in British Bridge technology, utilising the through girder form, reinforced with boxes at the top and bottom of the girders, and long continuous spans to achieve maximum waterway, a feature of major importance at this site. The construction of the bridge constituted a major project carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The bridge has strong and bold lines, providing a reassure presence in a landscape continually attacked by high floods which destroyed two previous bridges. It is a highly visually distinctive structure, and its enclosing form has always provided a distinctive travel experience, whether crossing by train, horse-drawn vehicle, motor vehicle or on foot. The Victoria Bridge and the visually complementary adjacent rail bridge form a landmark from both the Great Western highway and from the Nepean River and its banks. Both bridges are visually articulate about their structural properties and together, through their contrasting forms, provide an essay on the developments in metal bridge design across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe quality and longevity of the bridge is evidence of Whitton's correct understanding of the power of the Nepean and his enormous commitment to build railways of a high standard, employing cutting edge British technology in a colony barely out of its infancy. The high level of the bridge and its robust stone piers, as well as s the iron span on the western end of the bridge added after its initial completion are articulate about the devastating potential of the river and the high level of persistence intelligence and investment required to bridge it.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nPublic esteem for the bridge and an enduring interest in its management and use over its lifetime has imbued Victoria Bridge with social significance at a State level. Its historic, technical and aesthetic qualities are widely recognised within the Penrith, [[Sydney]] and Blue Mountains communities and more widely among railway and bridge enthusiasts and historians. It forms a landmark in the Penrith area and has been the centrepiece of the tourist and sporting activities of the Nepean which have attracted boating parties, swimmers, rowers, spectators and picnickers from a wide catchment area.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has local significance as a place of recreation. It is significant to the Heritage Engineers of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge has research significance at a State level as one of the oldest metal bridges in Australia. Together with the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] and [[Prince Alfred Bridge]] at [[Gundagai]], it is an important benchmark in early metal bridge design and construction practices giving insight into these activities which would be difficult to gain from other sources. With the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW and being the most intact of two remaining bridges in the state of this type, the Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its research potential to illustrate the design and construction techniques of this type of bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance as the only \"iron-through girder\" bridge that has not been significantly altered, making it unique in NSW. It was one of three iron box-girder bridges built in NSW and one of only two surviving bridges, the other being at Menangle. The third, being an 1869 single span over the [[Wollondilly River]] near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], was demolished after duplication of the Great Southern Railway in 1914. The bridge also has State significance more generally as one of the oldest metal bridges in NSW and Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is of state significance because it is representative of the cutting edge of bridge design in 1864 and is representative of early wrought iron heavy bridge design. It also represents the importance of high quality bridge design in the opening up of Western NSW to the railway.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPenrith Australia.jpg|The railway bridge, to the north of the Victoria Bridge, operational from 1907.\nVictoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith NSW (5554676422).jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\nVictoriabridgepenrith1.jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[List of places named after Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article |page=36}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Penrith Valley Heritage Drive}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=National Trust Item Sheet}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=RTA Bridge File 5/358.123 t1}}\n* {{cite web|author=|date=|title=The Nepean Times 14 April 1882 & 1883, 26 Jan 1884, 19 Apr 1884, 28 June 1884, 20 December 1884|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cardno|first=M.

officially known as '''The Nepean Bridge''',<ref name=nswshr-1950/> is a heritage-listed former [[railway bridge]] and now [[wrought iron]] box [[plate girder bridge|plate girder]] [[road bridge]] across the [[Nepean River]] on the [[Great Western Highway]] in the [[Greater Western Sydney|western]] [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in the [[City of Penrith]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]], the Engineer\u2013in\u2013Chief of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], and built from 1862 to 1867 by William Piper, Peto Brassey and Betts (superstructure), William Watkins (piers). It is also known as '''Victoria Bridge''', '''The Nepean Bridge''' and '''RTA Bridge No. 333'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016.<ref name=nswshr-1950>{{cite NSW SHR|5060797|Victoria Bridge|hr=01950|fn=EF14/22755|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge initially carried rail and [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse\u2013drawn traffic]], and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by [[Roads and Maritime Services]]. The bridge is the oldest surviving crossing of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]\u2013Nepean River. As at 2009, Roads and Maritime Services estimated that Victoria Bridge carried an average daily traffic of 25,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=RMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |title=Victoria Bridge |work=Road Projects |publisher=Roads and Maritime Services |date=October 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321061610/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1856 travelers who wished to cross the [[Nepean River]] were required to use either the Emu Ford or a punt that was located south of the present day Victoria Bridge on Punt Road. This arrangement meant that in times of flood, travellers were often delayed at Penrith for days or even weeks waiting to cross the river. A small village developed near Emu Ford to cater to the people waiting to cross the river. With the discovery of gold west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] the flow of people, produce and animals through Penrith and across the river increased dramatically. It was no coincidence that attempts were made to build a permanent structure across the river, resulting in two timber road bridges located near to the eventual Victoria Bridge site being constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nPrior to the construction of the Victoria Bridge, a punt service was located at the site of the bridge. Following the discovery of gold in the west of the Great Dividing Range demand for a permanent river crossing increased. A timber bridge was constructed with private funds, charging a toll for its use.\n\nIn 1850 the [[Government of New South Wales|Government]], reacting to lobbying by Penrith locals,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228775622 |title=NOTICE is hereby given, that an application will he made to His Excellency the |newspaper=[[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=55 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 April 1850 |page=693 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> passed an Act authorising the construction of a bridge at the western end of Jamison Road. This scheme never went ahead. A second Act was passed in 1851 authorising the formation of a company, allocating [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]6,000 for the construction of the bridge and allowing for the collection of tolls on the bridge. Following this act the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was formed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230769800 |title=An Act to Incorporate a Company to be called the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company, and to enable the said Company to erect and maintain a Bridge over the River Nepean at Penrith, in direct continuation of the present line of the Great Western Road, and to take Toll thereat for a term of years; and for other purposes therein mentioned.

Construction of the bridge was under the supervision of David McBeth, a Scottish surveyor.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge, completed in December 1855, was {{convert|700|ft|m|0|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, becoming the first bridge across the Nepean River in the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60171836 |title=OPENING OF THE PENRITH VICTORIA BRIDGE. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]] |issue=1554 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=2 January 1856 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> McBeth received a A\u00a3200 bonus on top of his A\u00a3300 salary for the timely completion of the works, the toll rights for the first year were sold by the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company for A\u00a32,250 and traffic flowed across the bridge.

In August 1857 a flood carried away the four centre spans, no doubt due to the poor security of the mid-stream timber piles which reportedly were frayed like mop heads where McBeth had attempted to drive them into rock. McBeth had lacked experience and knowledge in bridge building and although the piles close to the bank went in easily, the mid-stream timber piles had struck rock and failed to achieve a secure penetration.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe Penrith Nepean Bridge Company decided to rebuild the bridge and employed an engineer named Moriarty to supervise the works. The construction contract was awarded to William Lockhart for A\u00a39,000. The piles that remained from the first bridge were utilised in the new bridge design, against the advice of both Lockhart and Moriarty. The new bridge was of a different, stronger design than the first and construction was completed in good time with the toll rights for one year selling for A\u00a32,850. The bridge withstood its first flood, but in 1860 the most devastating flood in New South Wales history until that time washed away the entire superstructure and deposited it on a bank down river. The structure was almost intact. Had the piles been replaced as originally suggested by the engineer and builder, the bridge might well have survived the flood. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was ruined by the destruction of the bridge and the directors lost large sums of money. Following the destruction of this second bridge the Government supplied two punts to convey people and goods across the river. The punts were irreparably damaged by a flood in 1867.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe loss of the punts coincided with a period in which the Great Western Railway was in the advanced planning stages, including plans for the construction of a bridge over the Nepean River to link Penrith with [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in the west, as part of the Penrith to Weatherboard Line (later [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]]). It was decided that the required bridge would carry both a railway line and a single lane of road over the river, as a temporary solution.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Construction ==\nVictoria Bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways in NSW, [[John Whitton]] and checked in Britain by his brother-in-law and renowned railway engineer, [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]]. Victoria Bridge was designed to carry two railway tracks as it was intended that the road on the bridge be only a temporary arrangement. The flood of 1860 that had carried off the previous bridge influenced Whitton to raise the bridge deck by {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} after witnessing the power of high flood waters.<ref name=nswshr-1950/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13149766 |title=THE NEPEAN |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=LV |issue=9074 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 June 1867 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the bridge uses half through girders which are actually tall boxes made of riveted [[wrought iron]] plates was driven by the need to keep the underside of the bridge as shallow as possible to maximise headroom for flood clearance. The configuration of their boxes with their tall web plates, and upper box for lateral stability, reflected cutting edge design for the period. It utilised cutting edge of structural technology, using principles developed by Robert Stephenson in his design of the [[Britannia Bridge]] and the [[Conwy Railway Bridge]] in Wales; Thomas Telford and others who, by testing and theoretical work, developed techniques to prevent plate buckling by providing frequent vertical stiffeners, and sideways buckling of girders members by adding torsionally stiff boxes at the top and bottom. The first deep box girder bridge was designed by Stephenson and built across the [[Menai Strait]] in 1850. It was provided with suspension towers in case the deck was insufficiently strong and stiff, but the cables were never installed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe construction contract for Victoria Bridge was split into several parts. One contract for the construction of the piers was awarded to William Tyler in 1862. He commenced work but flooding in 1863 and 1864 damaged his equipment and contributed to his abandonment of the contract in August 1864. The contract was subsequently awarded to W. Watkins for the sum of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]44,658. He completed the work before the agreed completion date and avoided the A\u00a350 per week penalty he would have incurred had he not delivered on time.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe ironwork for the bridge was supplied by Peto, Brassey and Betts of [[Birkenhead, England]] for A\u00a341,750. The same firm had supplied the ironwork for the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] constructed on the Nepean River in 1863 and now the oldest surviving bridge on the NSW railway system. The timber approach viaduct for the Victoria Bridge was constructed by Mr Baillie at a cost of A\u00a38,716. Other small contracts for earthworks were also made bringing the total cost of the {{convert|1100|t|ST|0|adj=on}} iron bridge to approximately A\u00a3110,000.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nHigh floodwaters struck again soon after the bridge was opened in 1867, when the highest flood recorded until that time damaged the western timber approaches and washed away a portion of the spans and river bank. The main span however withstood this first major test and the flood waters did not reach the underside of the deck. A result of this flood a portion of the damaged timber viaduct was replaced by a shorter wrought iron box-girder span manufactured by the Thames Iron Company, [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[London]]. The bridge was in operation as a rail bridge during the repair works and was re-opened to road traffic in 1869. The Victoria Bridge was considered to be of such modern design that it was featured in the \"Modern Examples of Road and Railway Bridges\" by Maw and Dredge in 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}\n\nVictoria Bridge had a significant impact on the local economy. Prior to its opening Penrith station formed the rail head of the western line, making Penrith a trade hub. The introduction of the road across the Nepean River diminished the business in the town previously brought in by travellers delayed in Penrith by poor river conditions. Conversely the opening of the bridge and the road and railway to the west enabled the growth of centres west of the mountains and the tourist industry of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to become established.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nFollowing the increase in rail traffic on the Great Western Railway and the increase in the weight of locomotive engines, options were considered for the duplication of the railway line and of the Victoria Bridge. The possibility of using Victoria Bridge to carry two rail lines was considered. But this would have required the strengthening of the bridge by constructing intermediate piers between the existing piers of the bridge, thus halving the length of the spans. This technique had been applied to Victoria Bridge's sister structure the Menangle Bridge in 1907. It was however decided that the construction of a second bridge alongside the Victoria Bridge would be more appropriate and construction on a steel truss bridge was undertaken. The piers of the new bridge lined up with Victoria Bridge's existing piers in an attempt to minimise stresses on the structures during high river flows. In 1907 the railway bridge that now stands alongside Victoria Bridge was completed. With its completion the Victoria Bridge was converted to carry two lanes of traffic and a footway while the new bridge carried two rail lines.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> Originally it took one railway line and a road across the river, however in 1907 another bridge was constructed a few metres to the north which thenceforth took two railway lines across the river, and the original bridge reverted to road and pedestrian use only.<ref name=RTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |title=Victoria Bridge over Nepean River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority |accessdate=19 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902224229/https://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1930s the timber approach spans of the bridge were discovered to be heavily deteriorated through termite attack and the approach spans were replaced with reinforced concrete trestles and a concrete deck supported by [[rolled steel joist]]s (RSJs).<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe site of Victoria Bridge has long been a centre of recreation in the Penrith region. From the 1850s it has been used for national and international rowing competitions.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> The bridge is significant in the development of the colony of NSW as it allowed the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|railway]], which previously terminated at Penrith, to reach the Railway Blue Mountains and beyond, as well as providing continuous road passage across the river using the Great Western Highway.<ref name=RTA/>\n\n==Current use==\nToday the bridge's significance as a road route to and from the Blue Mountains is diminished. The [[M4 Western Motorway]] has replaced the Great Western Highway as the main arterial route, crossing the Nepean River at [[Regentville, New South Wales|Regentville]]. The M4 and the Great Western Highway join/separate at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone Hill]].\n\nThe bridge maintains its significance as a local tourist attraction and a centrepiece to sporting events along the Nepean River, as well as continuing to serve as vital link between the suburbs west of the Nepean, such as Emu Plains, and the major suburban centre of Penrith. The 1907 railway bridge still takes the Main Western and Blue Mountains railway lines over the river.\n\nAn undivided pedestrian pathway approximately {{convert|1.3|m}} is located adjacent to the roadway. Following community advocacy,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |title=It's time for a safe crossing of the Nepean River at Victoria Bridge |work=Fix Victoria Bridge |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023121/http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |archive-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> in 2010, Roads and Maritime Services commenced a feasibility study into a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway over the bridge.<ref name=RMS/> By mid-2016 Roads and Maritime Services contracted Seymour Whyte Constructions Pty Ltd to build a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Nepean River, south of the Victoria Bridge, to connect Penrith and Emu Plains.

The three main girders, each spanning a clear {{convert|56.7|m}}, were designed and constructed as one {{convert|181|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-long}} continuous structure (no separations over the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]), a novel structural feature for 1867.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}} This structure, supported by hollow stone piers at {{convert|60.35|m}} centres, has iron cross girders which support a concrete deck, {{convert|3.5|m}} below the tops of the main girders which are {{convert|3.95|m}} deep. Each [[Span (architecture)|span]] has a camber of {{convert|100|mm}}. There is a secondary, shorter, shallower, simply-supported girder, {{convert|41.1|m}} long at the western (Emu Plains) end of the bridge. All four iron girders have pairs of hollow boxes top and bottom separated by two web plates, an early version of box-girder construction. They are all of riveted construction. The total weight of [[wrought iron]] is approximately {{convert|1100|t|ST|0}}.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge consists of three main spans of iron box girder, one secondary span of iron box girder and three concrete approach spans on either side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe piers that support the main spans are constructed of [[Sydney sandstone]], the pier supporting the western end of the secondary iron girder span is constructed of mass concrete. The piers supporting the approach spans are constructed of concrete trestle frames. Piped services are supported under the pedestrian walkway portion of the deck and a large pipe is supported on the top flange of one of the main girders.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nT-section shaped stiffeners can be seen running vertically down the sides of the girders at the bearing ends. There are five stiffeners over the central piers and three over outer piers. Stiffeners prevent the thin web plates from buckling vertically.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nArchitectural curved angle sections appear on the outer face of the girders of the main span. These serve no structural function but \"lighten the appearance of the structure\"<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are flood markers on the side of the easternmost sandstone pier. The remnants of old light posts can be seen on the piers on the northern side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are modern street light posts and lights on the southern piers of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 1 December 2008, the fabric of the bridge is generally in very good condition. There is little sign of rust on iron elements and concrete and stone elements also appear to be in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe remains of the piles of the earlier bridges may still be embedded in the riverbed. There is also the possibility that relics of the construction platforms, crane bases or [[coffer]] damns used to construct Victoria Bridge may be found in the riverbed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1869 - Western approach spans were rebuilt following damage of the original timber approach spans by flood two weeks after the bridge was opened. The new spans were of a similar design to the main spans but with cast iron caisson piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*{{circa|1870}}-90 - The original road surface was close-fitting timber planking, wheel guides were installed early in the life of the bridge to help horse and bullock drawn vehicles drive in a straight line on the timber boards.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1883 - a galvanised iron fence was installed between the single railway track and the single lane road portion of the bridge. Around this time a warning bell was also installed to warn of approaching trains. This was installed after several incidents on the bridge involving livestock on the bridge being disturbed by passing trains.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1907 - new double track railway bridge was opened and the single railway line was removed from Victoria Bridge. The deck was also reconstructed to accommodate two lanes of traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1934 - Approach spans and abutments reconstructed in steel and concrete<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*19?? - The footway across the main spans reconstructed to provide for utility pipes.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 18 March 2015, Victoria Bridge is of state heritage significance as one of only three bridges of its type that were ever constructed in NSW, of which only two remain ('wrought iron-through girder'). Although two bridges of this type still remain, Victoria Bridge is unique in NSW due to the intactness of its form compared to Menangle bridge, which has undergone significant alterations to its structural form through the addition of intermediate piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria bridge represents a type of bridge that was considered to be the cutting edge of technology when it was designed in 1862. Design principles used in Victoria Bridge were pioneered by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and The Conwy Bridge in Britain. In addition to this prestigious design history, Victoria Bridge has the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge is of state significance due to its role in bridging the Nepean River for the Great Western Railway. Victoria Bridge was a key element in bringing the railways to western NSW. The bridge's association with the designer of the Great Western Railway, John Whitton is also of significance.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria Bridge (Penrith) was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its historical role as a vital element in the development of key road and rail transport routes across NSW from the 1860s and 1870s. In particular this includes the Great Western Railway line which opened up the western regions of the NSW, and made a significant contribution to improving trade flow across the state. As a road bridge it places a significant role in the story of crossing of the flood prone Nepean River, and was the first successful bridge crossing at Penrith. In addition to the wider advantages the bridge brought for transport across the state, it also has local significance for its economically on local workers and economies.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its association with its designer John Whitton, Engineer-in Chief for the NSW Railways, who also designed the Great Western Railway and the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] and [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]]. Mr Whitton was an outstanding engineer of his time and was also responsible for overseeing construction of the bridge and the railway line between Penrith and Wentworth Falls. It is also associated with the renowned British engineer John Fowler, of Firth of Forth Bridge Fame, who checked Whitton's design and plans and supervised the fabrication of the bridge in England.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state aesthetic significance because its design was based on important principles pioneered by Robert Stephenson on the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Bridge in Wales. It is the most intact of only two iron through girder bridges built in NSW. Menangle Bridge now has intermediate piers and so no longer has its original form. Victoria Bridge is the only one of its type still operating with the same structural system that it was built with. The bridge has been an important landmark in Penrith since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has state technical and aesthetic significance. Whitton's design employed the latest in British Bridge technology, utilising the through girder form, reinforced with boxes at the top and bottom of the girders, and long continuous spans to achieve maximum waterway, a feature of major importance at this site. The construction of the bridge constituted a major project carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The bridge has strong and bold lines, providing a reassure presence in a landscape continually attacked by high floods which destroyed two previous bridges. It is a highly visually distinctive structure, and its enclosing form has always provided a distinctive travel experience, whether crossing by train, horse-drawn vehicle, motor vehicle or on foot. The Victoria Bridge and the visually complementary adjacent rail bridge form a landmark from both the Great Western highway and from the Nepean River and its banks. Both bridges are visually articulate about their structural properties and together, through their contrasting forms, provide an essay on the developments in metal bridge design across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe quality and longevity of the bridge is evidence of Whitton's correct understanding of the power of the Nepean and his enormous commitment to build railways of a high standard, employing cutting edge British technology in a colony barely out of its infancy. The high level of the bridge and its robust stone piers, as well as s the iron span on the western end of the bridge added after its initial completion are articulate about the devastating potential of the river and the high level of persistence intelligence and investment required to bridge it.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nPublic esteem for the bridge and an enduring interest in its management and use over its lifetime has imbued Victoria Bridge with social significance at a State level. Its historic, technical and aesthetic qualities are widely recognised within the Penrith, [[Sydney]] and Blue Mountains communities and more widely among railway and bridge enthusiasts and historians. It forms a landmark in the Penrith area and has been the centrepiece of the tourist and sporting activities of the Nepean which have attracted boating parties, swimmers, rowers, spectators and picnickers from a wide catchment area.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has local significance as a place of recreation. It is significant to the Heritage Engineers of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge has research significance at a State level as one of the oldest metal bridges in Australia. Together with the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] and [[Prince Alfred Bridge]] at [[Gundagai]], it is an important benchmark in early metal bridge design and construction practices giving insight into these activities which would be difficult to gain from other sources. With the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW and being the most intact of two remaining bridges in the state of this type, the Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its research potential to illustrate the design and construction techniques of this type of bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance as the only \"iron-through girder\" bridge that has not been significantly altered, making it unique in NSW. It was one of three iron box-girder bridges built in NSW and one of only two surviving bridges, the other being at Menangle. The third, being an 1869 single span over the [[Wollondilly River]] near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], was demolished after duplication of the Great Southern Railway in 1914. The bridge also has State significance more generally as one of the oldest metal bridges in NSW and Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is of state significance because it is representative of the cutting edge of bridge design in 1864 and is representative of early wrought iron heavy bridge design. It also represents the importance of high quality bridge design in the opening up of Western NSW to the railway.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPenrith Australia.jpg|The railway bridge, to the north of the Victoria Bridge, operational from 1907.\nVictoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith NSW (5554676422).jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\nVictoriabridgepenrith1.jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[List of places named after Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article |page=36}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Penrith Valley Heritage Drive}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=National Trust Item Sheet}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=RTA Bridge File 5/358.123 t1}}\n* {{cite web|author=|date=|title=The Nepean Times 14 April 1882 & 1883, 26 Jan 1884, 19 Apr 1884, 28 June 1884, 20 December 1884|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cardno|first=M.

The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658) and briefly his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658\u20131659). This was particularly notable given that an English king had never been executed before. In England, the monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn |EB staff |2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These were not restricted to [[England]], as [[Wales]] was part of the Kingdom of England and affected accordingly. The conflicts also involved wars with Scotland and Ireland, and civil wars within them.\n\nThe wars spanning all four countries are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the early 19th century, [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] referred to it as \"the Great Civil War\".<ref>Walter Scott, ''Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since'' (1814), Chap. 2.</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, these conflicts were more concerned with the manner in which the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland were governed. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} while some historians \u2013 notably [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912\u20132003) \u2013 long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb |Hill |1972 |loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEach side had a geographical stronghold, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The royalty's included the countryside, the shires, the cathedral city of Oxford, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. Parliament's spanned the industrial centres, ports, and economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England, including the remaining cathedral cities (except York, Chester, Worcester). Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn |Smith|1983 |p=251}}{{sfn |Hughes |1985 |pp=236\u201363}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany officers and veteran soldiers had fought in European wars, notably the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Spanish and the Dutch, which began in 1568.{{sfn |Baker |1986|p=}}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry. The two sides would line up opposite one another, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre. These carried matchlock muskets, an inaccurate weapon which nevertheless could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. Musketeers would assemble three rows deep, the first kneeling, second crouching, and third standing, allowing all to fire a volley simultaneously.<ref name=\"Simkin\">{{cite web |author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War \u2013 Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2015}} At times, troops divided into two groups, allowing one to reload while the other fired.{{sfn |Burne |Young |1998 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Among the musketeers were pike men, carrying [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long, whose main purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges.

Elizabeth had been succeeded by her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th-century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James's personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James's peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son Charles I in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles followed his father's dream in hoping to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a single kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb |Croft |2003 |p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians were suspicious of such a move, fearing that such a new kingdom might destroy old English traditions that had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb |McClelland |1996 |p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in an English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, it functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a Parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had acquired over the centuries ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the 17th century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. So if the king wanted to ensure smooth revenue collection, he needed gentry co-operation. For all of the Crown's legal authority, its resources were limited by any modern standard to an extent that if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked a practical means of compelling them.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, monarchs ordered the election of representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with most voters being the owners of property, although in some [[potwalloper]] boroughs every male householder could vote. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. So the concept of Parliaments allowed representatives of the property-owning class to meet, primarily, at least from the point of view of the monarch, to sanction whatever taxes the monarch wished to collect. In the process, the representatives could debate  and enact [[statute]]s, or [[act of parliament|acts]]. However, Parliament lacked the power to force its will upon the monarch; its only leverage was the threat of withholding the financial means required to implement his plans.{{sfn |Johnston |1901 |pp=83\u201386}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage in 1625 to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] French princess: [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]. Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |pp=129\u201330}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]], whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Such military support for Protestants on the Continent potentially alleviated concerns about the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on giving command of the English force to his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This saved Buckingham but confirmed the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Hampden]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up a [[Petition of Right]], which Charles accepted as a concession to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> The Petition made reference to [[Magna Carta]],<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> but did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} Several more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused outrage;{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison and came to be seen as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn |Russell |1998 |p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Rosner |Theibault |2000 |p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's policies were determined by his lack of money. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One was to revive conventions, often outdated. For example, a failure to attend and receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation became a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through [[ship money]], demanding in 1634\u20131636 that the inland English counties pay a tax for the [[Royal Navy]] to counter the threat of privateers and pirates in the English Channel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Established law supported the policy of coastal counties and inland ports such as London paying ship money in times of need, but it had not been applied to inland counties before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many saw it as yet another extra-Parliamentary, illegal tax,<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb |Pipes |1999 |p=143}}.</ref> which prompted some prominent men to refuse to pay it. Charles issued a writ against John Hampden for his failure to pay, and although five judges including Sir George Croke supported Hampden, seven judges found in favour of the King in 1638.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594\u20131643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> The fines imposed on people who refused to pay ship money and standing out against its illegality aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring his \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures. He believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political adviser, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637, [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views \u2014 a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived statutes from the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican services.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=74}}.</ref> Charles wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted. A riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]]. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first tested by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]],<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=96}}.</ref> but after an inconclusive campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. This truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in mid-1640. A Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere in Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, but had insufficient funds to do so. He needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> Its majority faction, led by [[John Pym]], used this appeal for money as a chance to discuss grievances against the Crown and oppose the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]]'' (offense against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence its name, \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles's chief advisers, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632,<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Coward |2003 |p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field at their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the whole of Northern England was occupied and Charles forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. Had he not done so they would have pillaged and burnt the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Sharp |2000 |p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial state. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\" Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against him and his government, with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead. They took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures \u2014 including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes \u2014 upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> The members passed a law stating that a new Parliament would convene at least once every three years \u2014 without the King's summons if need be. Other laws passed making it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since this Parliament has been known as the Long Parliament. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn |See {{Harvnb |Walter |1999 |p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament, the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence of Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that he had encouraged the King to use his Ireland-raised forces to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref>{{harvnb |Upham |1842 |p=187}}</ref> These notes contained evidence that Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn |Upham |1842 |p=187}}{{sfn |Hibbert |1968 |p=154}}{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a [[Bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]] stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that he be put to death.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}} Unlike a guilty verdict in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require the king's approval. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords opposed the severity of a death sentence on Strafford. Yet increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused his assent. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn |Abbott |2020}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn |Coward |1994 |p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=222}}{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=127}} The Triennial Act required Parliament to be summoned at least once in three years. When the King failed to issue a proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in distraint of knighthood, and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back sharply, the Courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn |Gregg |1981 |p=335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', Parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and Episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=130}}{{sfn |Abbott |2020|nopp=y}}\n\nCharles and his Parliament hoped that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war, but in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, and Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=109\u2013113}}.</ref> Rumors circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=113}} for concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, Charles, accompanied by 400 soldiers, attempted to arrest [[five members]] of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> So the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642, these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose from many local grievances. For example, imposed drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] disrupted the livelihood of thousands after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hughes |1991 |p=127}}.</ref> Many saw the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing much of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it such people as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King.

On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in church and state, while on the other, most Parliamentarians initially took up arms to defend what they saw as a traditional balance of government in church and state, which the bad advice the King received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King \u2014 at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] \u2014 through to radicals who sought major reforms in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|religious independence]] and redistribution of power at a national level.

Armed political [[Cavalier|Royalism]] was at an end, but despite being a prisoner, Charles I was considered by himself and his opponents (almost to the last) as necessary to ensure the success of whichever group could come to terms with him. Thus he passed successively into the hands of the Scots, the Parliament and the Army. The King attempted to reverse the verdict of arms by \"[[Flirting|coquetting]]\" with each in turn. On 3 June 1647, Cornet [[George Joyce]] of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax's]] horse seized the King for the Army, after which the English Presbyterians and the Scots began to prepare for a fresh civil war, less than two years after the conclusion of the first, this time against \"Independency\", as embodied in the Army. After making use of the Army's sword, its opponents attempted to disband it, to send it on foreign service and to cut off its arrears of pay. The result was that the Army leadership was exasperated beyond control, and, remembering not merely their grievances but also the principle for which the Army had fought, it soon became the most powerful political force in the realm. From 1646 to 1648 the breach between Army and Parliament widened day by day until finally the Presbyterian party, combined with the Scots and the remaining Royalists, felt itself strong enough to begin a Second Civil War.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=45.

Resistance continued for a time [[Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|in the Channel Islands]],{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Ireland and Scotland, but with the pacification of England, resistance elsewhere did not threaten the military supremacy of the New Model Army and its Parliamentary paymasters.\n\n==Political control==\nDuring the Wars, the Parliamentarians established a number of successive committees to oversee the war effort. The first, the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]] set up in July 1642, comprised 15 members of Parliament.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} After the Anglo-Scottish alliance against the Royalists, the [[Committee of Both Kingdoms]] replaced the Committee of Safety between 1644 and 1648.<ref name=Kennedy-96>{{Harvnb |Kennedy |2000 |p=96}}.</ref> Parliament dissolved the Committee of Both Kingdoms when the alliance ended, but its English members continued to meet as the [[Derby House Committee]].<ref name=Kennedy-96/> A second Committee of Safety then replaced it.\n\n===Episcopacy===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|[[William Laud]], Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury.]]\nDuring the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. [[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' in the New Testament were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.\n\nThis vision of at least partial democracy in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as King, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his authority. Matters came to a head when Charles I appointed [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645 and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639\u20131640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power under [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn |King |1968 |p=523\u201337}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.\n\nAlthough the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that\n{{quote|due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any manner of Commerce or Traffic with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all manner of persons, Foreigners, and others, all manner of Commerce, Traffic and Correspondence whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbados, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.}}\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n{{quote|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}\n\nThe Parliament began assembling a fleet to invade the Royalist colonies, but many of the English islands in the Caribbean were captured by the Dutch and French in 1651 during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend off the might of Spain, these defences were too powerful for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]], which was forced instead to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 pp. 211\u201314]}}.</ref>\n\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-211>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 p. 211]}}.</ref> out of a total population of about five million.<ref name=James-187>{{Harvnb |James |2003 |p=187}}, cites: {{Harvnb |Carlton |1995a |p=212}}.</ref>\n\nFigures for Scotland are less reliable and should be treated with caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimated that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> out of a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as tentative; they do not include an estimated 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 4 percent loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6 percent, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41 percent of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation of Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16 percent of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16 percent.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society in the 1640s to gain personal advantages. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers, notably the Thames [[watermen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of Royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and church hierarchy. Some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such estates.{{sfn|O'Riordan |1993 |pp=184\u2013200}} The old ''status quo'' began a retrenchment after the end of the First Civil War in 1646, and more especially after the Restoration in 1660, but some gains were long-term. The democratic element introduced into the watermen's company in 1642, for example, survived with vicissitudes until 1827.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lindley |1997 |p=160}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting among various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.{{efn |For a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military, see {{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |pp=7\u201311}}.}}\n\nOn Oliver Cromwell's death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterward dissolved this as well.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretense of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=34}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. On 4 April 1660, in the [[Declaration of Breda]], Charles II made known the conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=31}}.</ref> Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=48}}.</ref> which met for the first time on 25 April 1660. On 8 May 1660, it declared that Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Charles returned from exile on 23 May 1660. On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |pp=5\u20136}}.</ref> His coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the ''[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament. So the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=8}}.</ref> The outcome of this system was that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], managed to forestall the kind of revolution typical of European republican movements which generally resulted in total abolition of monarchy. Thus the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\n{{Puritans}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. It explained the Civil War as resulting from centuries of struggle between Parliament (notably the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to dictate law arbitrarily. The major Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S. R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\", which challenged the repressive Stuart Church and prepared the way for [[religious toleration]]. So Puritanism was seen as the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kaye |1995 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106#v=onepage p. 106]}} quoting from the pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb |Burgess |1990 |pp=609\u201327}}.</ref> notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.).{{sfn |Russell |1973 |p={{Page needed |date=April 2017}}}} These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, so returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}</ref> This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> Furthermore, Puritans did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.<ref name=Burgess/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}\n\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians discarded and replaced the historical title \"English Civil War\" with the titles the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the \"British Civil Wars\", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood in isolation from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but through his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near-permanent crisis management, often unwilling to concede enough ground to any faction to neutralise the threat, and in some cases doing so would only to antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed-upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn |Ohlmeyer |2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'', written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}} ''Behemoth'' offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a statement to explain why Charles I could not hold his place of power and maintain peace in his kingdom.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in ''Behemoth''): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his ''Behemoth'' by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn |Goldsmith |1966 |pp=x\u2013xiii}} He held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war \u2014 \"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn |Sommerville |2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that ''Behemoth'' has not received due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and under-rated in the shadow of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} One factor that may have distracted attention from it as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for ''Behemoth''. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathise with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} For instance, he credits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} What is more \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- *[[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite web |ref ={{harvid|Abbott|2020}}\n|last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=Charles I: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |url = http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall |accessdate=18 February 2020 |year=2020}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden the Patriot 1594\u20131643 |year=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9 |location = Barnsley |pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.

The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658) and briefly his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658\u20131659). This was particularly notable given that an English king had never been executed before. In England, the monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn |EB staff |2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These were not restricted to [[England]], as [[Wales]] was part of the Kingdom of England and affected accordingly. The conflicts also involved wars with Scotland and Ireland, and civil wars within them.\n\nThe wars spanning all four countries are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the early 19th century, [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] referred to it as \"the Great Civil War\".<ref>Walter Scott, ''Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since'' (1814), Chap. 2.</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, these conflicts were more concerned with the manner in which the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland were governed. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} while some historians \u2013 notably [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912\u20132003) \u2013 long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb |Hill |1972 |loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEach side had a geographical stronghold, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The royalty's included the countryside, the shires, the cathedral city of Oxford, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. Parliament's spanned the industrial centres, ports, and economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England, including the remaining cathedral cities (except York, Chester, Worcester). Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn |Smith|1983 |p=251}}{{sfn |Hughes |1985 |pp=236\u201363}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany officers and veteran soldiers had fought in European wars, notably the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Spanish and the Dutch, which began in 1568.{{sfn |Baker |1986|p=}}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry. The two sides would line up opposite one another, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre. These carried matchlock muskets, an inaccurate weapon which nevertheless could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. Musketeers would assemble three rows deep, the first kneeling, second crouching, and third standing, allowing all to fire a volley simultaneously.<ref name=\"Simkin\">{{cite web |author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War \u2013 Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2015}} At times, troops divided into two groups, allowing one to reload while the other fired.{{sfn |Burne |Young |1998 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Among the musketeers were pike men, carrying [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long, whose main purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges.

Its main aim was to rout the opponents' cavalry, then turn and overpower their infantry.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Gaunt |title=The English Civil War: A Military History |year=2014 |location=London |publisher=I.B.

Prince Rupert, commanding the king's cavalry, used a tactic learned while fighting in the Dutch army, where cavalry would charge at full speed into the opponent's infantry, firing their pistols just before impact.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Young |title=The English Civil War Armies |year=1977 |orig-year=1973 |location=Reading |publisher=Osprey |series=Men-at-arms series |oclc=505954051 |postscript=. }}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHowever, with Oliver Cromwell and the introduction of the more disciplined [[New Model Army]], a group of disciplined pike men would stand its ground, which could have a devastating effect.\n\nThe Royalist cavalry had a tendency to chase down individual targets after the initial charge, leaving their forces scattered and tired, whereas [[Ironside (cavalry)|Cromwell's cavalry]] was slower but better disciplined.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /> Trained to operate as a single unit, it went on to win many decisive victories.<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Tincey |title=Ironsides: English Cavalry 1588\u20131688 |year=2012 |page=63 |publisher=Osprey |oclc=842879605 |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===The King's rule===\nThe English Civil War broke out in 1642, less than 40 years after the death of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Elizabeth had been succeeded by her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th-century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James's personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James's peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son Charles I in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles followed his father's dream in hoping to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a single kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb |Croft |2003 |p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians were suspicious of such a move, fearing that such a new kingdom might destroy old English traditions that had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb |McClelland |1996 |p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in an English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, it functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a Parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had acquired over the centuries ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the 17th century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. So if the king wanted to ensure smooth revenue collection, he needed gentry co-operation. For all of the Crown's legal authority, its resources were limited by any modern standard to an extent that if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked a practical means of compelling them.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, monarchs ordered the election of representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with most voters being the owners of property, although in some [[potwalloper]] boroughs every male householder could vote. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. So the concept of Parliaments allowed representatives of the property-owning class to meet, primarily, at least from the point of view of the monarch, to sanction whatever taxes the monarch wished to collect. In the process, the representatives could debate  and enact [[statute]]s, or [[act of parliament|acts]]. However, Parliament lacked the power to force its will upon the monarch; its only leverage was the threat of withholding the financial means required to implement his plans.{{sfn |Johnston |1901 |pp=83\u201386}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage in 1625 to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] French princess: [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]. Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |pp=129\u201330}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]], whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Such military support for Protestants on the Continent potentially alleviated concerns about the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on giving command of the English force to his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This saved Buckingham but confirmed the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Hampden]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up a [[Petition of Right]], which Charles accepted as a concession to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> The Petition made reference to [[Magna Carta]],<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> but did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} Several more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused outrage;{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison and came to be seen as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn |Russell |1998 |p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Rosner |Theibault |2000 |p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's policies were determined by his lack of money. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One was to revive conventions, often outdated. For example, a failure to attend and receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation became a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through [[ship money]], demanding in 1634\u20131636 that the inland English counties pay a tax for the [[Royal Navy]] to counter the threat of privateers and pirates in the English Channel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Established law supported the policy of coastal counties and inland ports such as London paying ship money in times of need, but it had not been applied to inland counties before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many saw it as yet another extra-Parliamentary, illegal tax,<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb |Pipes |1999 |p=143}}.</ref> which prompted some prominent men to refuse to pay it. Charles issued a writ against John Hampden for his failure to pay, and although five judges including Sir George Croke supported Hampden, seven judges found in favour of the King in 1638.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594\u20131643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> The fines imposed on people who refused to pay ship money and standing out against its illegality aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring his \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures. He believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political adviser, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637, [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views \u2014 a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived statutes from the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican services.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=74}}.</ref> Charles wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted. A riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]]. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first tested by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]],<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=96}}.</ref> but after an inconclusive campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. This truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in mid-1640. A Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere in Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, but had insufficient funds to do so. He needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> Its majority faction, led by [[John Pym]], used this appeal for money as a chance to discuss grievances against the Crown and oppose the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]]'' (offense against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence its name, \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles's chief advisers, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632,<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Coward |2003 |p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field at their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the whole of Northern England was occupied and Charles forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. Had he not done so they would have pillaged and burnt the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Sharp |2000 |p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial state. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\" Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against him and his government, with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead. They took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures \u2014 including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes \u2014 upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> The members passed a law stating that a new Parliament would convene at least once every three years \u2014 without the King's summons if need be. Other laws passed making it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since this Parliament has been known as the Long Parliament. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn |See {{Harvnb |Walter |1999 |p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament, the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence of Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that he had encouraged the King to use his Ireland-raised forces to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref>{{harvnb |Upham |1842 |p=187}}</ref> These notes contained evidence that Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn |Upham |1842 |p=187}}{{sfn |Hibbert |1968 |p=154}}{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a [[Bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]] stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that he be put to death.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}} Unlike a guilty verdict in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require the king's approval. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords opposed the severity of a death sentence on Strafford. Yet increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused his assent. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn |Abbott |2020}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn |Coward |1994 |p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=222}}{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=127}} The Triennial Act required Parliament to be summoned at least once in three years. When the King failed to issue a proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in distraint of knighthood, and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back sharply, the Courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn |Gregg |1981 |p=335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', Parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and Episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=130}}{{sfn |Abbott |2020|nopp=y}}\n\nCharles and his Parliament hoped that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war, but in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, and Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=109\u2013113}}.</ref> Rumors circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=113}} for concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, Charles, accompanied by 400 soldiers, attempted to arrest [[five members]] of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> So the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642, these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose from many local grievances. For example, imposed drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] disrupted the livelihood of thousands after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hughes |1991 |p=127}}.</ref> Many saw the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing much of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it such people as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=180}}.</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War (1642\u20131646)==\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow-green), 1642\u20131645]]\nIn early January 1642, a few days after failing to capture five members of the House of Commons, Charles feared for the safety of his family and retinue and left the London area for the north country.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=57}}.</ref> Further frequent negotiations by letter between the King and the Long Parliament, through to early summer, proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth commanded by Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the weaponry depository used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter the town,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\">{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham's arrest as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it.

Historians estimate that both sides had only about 15,000 men between them,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities from the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |pp=403\u201304}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in church and state, while on the other, most Parliamentarians initially took up arms to defend what they saw as a traditional balance of government in church and state, which the bad advice the King received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King \u2014 at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] \u2014 through to radicals who sought major reforms in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|religious independence]] and redistribution of power at a national level. However, even the most radical Parliamentarian supporters still favoured keeping Charles on the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For all information since the last citation}}\n\nAfter the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], raising the royal standard there on 22 August 1642.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=111}}.</ref> At the time, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalries and a small number of Yorkshire infantrymen, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=96}}.</ref> his supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a westerly direction, first to [[Stafford]], then on to [[Shrewsbury]], as support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley area and in North Wales.<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |pp=170, 183}}.</ref> While passing through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], he declared in what became known as the \"[[Wellington Declaration]]\" that he would uphold the \"Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament\".<ref>{{harvnb |Sherwood |1992 |p=6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Samuel Cooper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell]]]]\n\nThe Parliamentarians who opposed the King did not remain passive in this pre-war period. As in Hull, they took measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause. On 9 June they voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] its commander three days later.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |pp=108\u201309}}.</ref> He received orders \"to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the Prince [of Wales] and the Duke of York [James II] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them.\"<ref>{{Harvnb |Hibbert |1993 |p=65}}.</ref> The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]] whom Parliament appointed used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |pp=161, 165}}.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=113}}.</ref> picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Huntingdonshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by Oliver Cromwell).{{efn|Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver {{Harv |Wedgwood |1970 |p=106}}.}} By mid-September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalries and [[dragoon]]s. On 14 September he moved his army to [[Coventry]] and then to the north of the [[Cotswolds]],<ref>Wegwood, p. 115.</ref> a strategy that placed it between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would meet sooner or later. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a troop of about 1,000 Royalist cavalry under [[Prince Rupert]], a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=148}}.</ref> defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under Colonel John Brown at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], which crossed the [[River Teme]] close to [[Worcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |pp=171\u201388}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rupert of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]]]\nRupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near [[Worcester]], or march down the now open road towards London. The Council decided on the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words, \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that the earl of Essex would put himself in their way.\"{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=404}} So the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east.

It passed the [[Self-denying Ordinance]], by which all members of either House of Parliament laid down their commands and re-organized its main forces into the [[New Model Army]], under the command of Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], with Cromwell as his second-in-command and [[Lieutenant General|Lieutenant-General]] of Horse.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=373}}.</ref> In two decisive engagements \u2014 the [[Battle of Naseby]] on 14 June and the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July \u2014 the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles's armies.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=428}}.</ref>\n\nIn the remains of his English realm, Charles tried to recover a stable base of support by consolidating the Midlands. He began to form an axis between Oxford and [[Newark-on-Trent]] in Nottinghamshire. These towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than others. He took [[Leicester]], which lies between them, but found his resources exhausted.

Armed political [[Cavalier|Royalism]] was at an end, but despite being a prisoner, Charles I was considered by himself and his opponents (almost to the last) as necessary to ensure the success of whichever group could come to terms with him. Thus he passed successively into the hands of the Scots, the Parliament and the Army. The King attempted to reverse the verdict of arms by \"[[Flirting|coquetting]]\" with each in turn. On 3 June 1647, Cornet [[George Joyce]] of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax's]] horse seized the King for the Army, after which the English Presbyterians and the Scots began to prepare for a fresh civil war, less than two years after the conclusion of the first, this time against \"Independency\", as embodied in the Army. After making use of the Army's sword, its opponents attempted to disband it, to send it on foreign service and to cut off its arrears of pay. The result was that the Army leadership was exasperated beyond control, and, remembering not merely their grievances but also the principle for which the Army had fought, it soon became the most powerful political force in the realm. From 1646 to 1648 the breach between Army and Parliament widened day by day until finally the Presbyterian party, combined with the Scots and the remaining Royalists, felt itself strong enough to begin a Second Civil War.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=45.

The first, the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]] set up in July 1642, comprised 15 members of Parliament.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} After the Anglo-Scottish alliance against the Royalists, the [[Committee of Both Kingdoms]] replaced the Committee of Safety between 1644 and 1648.<ref name=Kennedy-96>{{Harvnb |Kennedy |2000 |p=96}}.</ref> Parliament dissolved the Committee of Both Kingdoms when the alliance ended, but its English members continued to meet as the [[Derby House Committee]].<ref name=Kennedy-96/> A second Committee of Safety then replaced it.\n\n===Episcopacy===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|[[William Laud]], Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury.]]\nDuring the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. [[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' in the New Testament were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.\n\nThis vision of at least partial democracy in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as King, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his authority. Matters came to a head when Charles I appointed [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645 and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639\u20131640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power under [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn |King |1968 |p=523\u201337}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.\n\nAlthough the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that\n{{quote|due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any manner of Commerce or Traffic with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all manner of persons, Foreigners, and others, all manner of Commerce, Traffic and Correspondence whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbados, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.}}\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n{{quote|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}\n\nThe Parliament began assembling a fleet to invade the Royalist colonies, but many of the English islands in the Caribbean were captured by the Dutch and French in 1651 during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend off the might of Spain, these defences were too powerful for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]], which was forced instead to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 pp. 211\u201314]}}.</ref>\n\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-211>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 p. 211]}}.</ref> out of a total population of about five million.<ref name=James-187>{{Harvnb |James |2003 |p=187}}, cites: {{Harvnb |Carlton |1995a |p=212}}.</ref>\n\nFigures for Scotland are less reliable and should be treated with caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimated that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> out of a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as tentative; they do not include an estimated 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 4 percent loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6 percent, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41 percent of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation of Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16 percent of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16 percent.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society in the 1640s to gain personal advantages. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers, notably the Thames [[watermen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of Royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and church hierarchy.

In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting among various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.{{efn |For a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military, see {{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |pp=7\u201311}}.}}\n\nOn Oliver Cromwell's death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterward dissolved this as well.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretense of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=34}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland.

So the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=8}}.</ref> The outcome of this system was that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], managed to forestall the kind of revolution typical of European republican movements which generally resulted in total abolition of monarchy. Thus the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\n{{Puritans}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. It explained the Civil War as resulting from centuries of struggle between Parliament (notably the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to dictate law arbitrarily. The major Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S. R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\", which challenged the repressive Stuart Church and prepared the way for [[religious toleration]]. So Puritanism was seen as the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kaye |1995 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106#v=onepage p. 106]}} quoting from the pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb |Burgess |1990 |pp=609\u201327}}.</ref> notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.).{{sfn |Russell |1973 |p={{Page needed |date=April 2017}}}} These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, so returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}</ref> This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> Furthermore, Puritans did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.<ref name=Burgess/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}\n\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians discarded and replaced the historical title \"English Civil War\" with the titles the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the \"British Civil Wars\", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood in isolation from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but through his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near-permanent crisis management, often unwilling to concede enough ground to any faction to neutralise the threat, and in some cases doing so would only to antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed-upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn |Ohlmeyer |2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'', written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}} ''Behemoth'' offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a statement to explain why Charles I could not hold his place of power and maintain peace in his kingdom.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in ''Behemoth''): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his ''Behemoth'' by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn |Goldsmith |1966 |pp=x\u2013xiii}} He held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war \u2014 \"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn |Sommerville |2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that ''Behemoth'' has not received due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and under-rated in the shadow of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} One factor that may have distracted attention from it as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for ''Behemoth''. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathise with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} For instance, he credits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} What is more \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- *[[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite web |ref ={{harvid|Abbott|2020}}\n|last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=Charles I: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |url = http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall |accessdate=18 February 2020 |year=2020}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden the Patriot 1594\u20131643 |year=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9 |location = Barnsley |pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.
