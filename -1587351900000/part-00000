In the early 1700s European traders arrived, and colonial settlements established by mid century. Subsequently the area was subject to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. In the 1800s trade began to be supplemented by major mining and manufacturing operations, and the area population continued to grow rapidly from the late 1800s and the early 1900s, with numerous immigrants from Europe and African Americans of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Southern United States.\n\nThe Land Company of the Colony of Pennsylvania began to offer deeds in the general area which was to become Wilkinsburg, in 1769. Andrew Levi Levy, Sr. purchased 266 acres of woodland, to which he officially gave the name of Africa (for reasons which remain obscure).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QFVo5W0YP2IC&pg=PA9&lpg=PP1&focus=viewport&vq=henry+herr&dq=%22john+wilkins+jr%22#v=onepage&q&f=false Wilkinsburg Historical Society (2007) ''Wilkinsburg'', Arcadia Publishing, 9.

The borough has a remarkably high concentration of [[church (building)|church]]es, mostly [[Protestantism|Protestant]], which is unusual in a predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] region of the country. According to borough leader James Kelly, the reversal of Wilkinsburg's annexation to Pittsburgh in the 1870s was in order to maintain the religious integrity of the community. Wilkinsburg was known during this time by many as \"The Holy City\".\n\n===Public library===\nIn 1899 the Wilkinsburg library was founded as a branch of the [[Carnegie Free Library of Braddock|Braddock library]] (which was the first of the [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] in the nation). The Wilkinsburg library also serves as a meeting place for council members as well as being the home of the local police department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilkinsburglibrary.org/aboutus.php|title=Wilkinsburg Public Library : About Us|website=www.wilkinsburglibrary.org|access-date=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n===Home of modern broadcasting===\n[[File:Frank Conrad radio station 8XK 1920.jpg|thumb|Frank Conrad radio station 8XK 1920]]\n\nWilkinsburg won a note in the history of radio broadcasting, when resident [[Frank Conrad]] spearheaded a radio laboratory at his home in Wilkinsburg, coordinated with [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] and the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Signal Corps]], under a special [[World War I|war time]] permit (using call signs 2-WM and 2-WE).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/radioindustrysto00harvrich#page/191/mode/1up \"The Early History of Broadcasting in the United States\"] by H.

Wilkinsburg thus became the original location for modern broadcasting, combining the concepts of \"the station, the audience, the programs, and a means to pay for the programs\", after Conrad accepted a donation from a Wilkinsburg music store to promote its musical offerings<ref>[http://www.nmbpgh.org/conrad_project/historical_background/conrad.htm \"Frank Conrad: Sleepless Genius\"], National Museum of Broadcasting (nmbpgh.org)</ref> This was all before and leading up to [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] and the development of commercial radio.<ref>http://www.nmbpgh.org/conrad_project/historical_background/commercial.htm</ref> In 1916, the world's first commercially licensed radio station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] began broadcasting as experimental station 8XK from studios of Westinghouse in East Pittsburgh and in a small garage owned by [[Frank Conrad]], before it was launched with its current call letters on November 2, 1920. In 1923, Wilkinsburg-based [[Russia]]n immigrant [[Vladimir Zworykin]] designed and patented the [[iconoscope]], the photocell \"eye\" of early television cameras. Today, ABC affiliate [[WTAE-TV]] is located in the borough on Ardmore Boulevard.\n\n===Current development===\nAlthough the borough has been economically depressed in recent years, many efforts are being made to change this. In 2004, the [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]] launched initiatives in partnership with its for-profit development affiliate, Landmark Development Corporation, to begin restoration work on historic structures in Wilkinsburg's Hamnett Place neighborhood. Within a decade, more than 70 structures were improved, a new neighborhood center was opened, and the community's supply of [[Affordable housing in the United States|affordable housing]] was increased. The collaborators were subsequently honored with the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation National Preservation Award in recognition of their accomplishments.<ref>Sisson, Patrick. \"[https://www.curbed.com/2017/11/20/16680750/historic-preservation-pittsburgh-hamnett-place How historic preservation rebuilt a Pittsburgh neighborhood: Brick house by brick house, the award-winning effort to restore Hamnett Place offers a roadmap for creating affordable housing.]\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: ''Curbed'', November 20, 2017.</ref><ref>Martines, Jamie. \"[https://archive.triblive.com/local/allegheny/13960517-74/wilkinsburg-continues-efforts-to-overcome-blight-renew-itself Wilkinsburg continues efforts to overcome blight, renew itself].\" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: TribLive, August 10, 2018.</ref> During this time, the [[Hamnett Historic District]] was also established; that historic district was then approved on June 28, 2010 for listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>\"[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/06/08/2010-13618/national-register-of-historic-places-notification-of-pending-nominations-and-related-actions National Register of Historic Places; Notification of Pending Nominations and Related Actions],\" in ''Federal Register'', June 8, 2010, pp. 32502-32503.

In the early 1700s European traders arrived, and colonial settlements established by mid century. Subsequently the area was subject to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. In the 1800s trade began to be supplemented by major mining and manufacturing operations, and the area population continued to grow rapidly from the late 1800s and the early 1900s, with numerous immigrants from Europe and African Americans of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Southern United States.\n\nThe Land Company of the Colony of Pennsylvania began to offer deeds in the general area which was to become Wilkinsburg, in 1769.

The experiences of its members during [[World War II]] are the subject of the HBO miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' based on [[Band of Brothers (book)|the book]] of the same name by historian [[Stephen Ambrose]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe 506th PIR was an experimental airborne regiment created in 1942 to jump from [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport airplanes into hostile territory.\n \nE Company was established at [[Camp Toccoa]], Georgia. Before attending paratrooper training, the unit's troops performed the standard battle drills and physical training that comes with being in the parachute infantry. One of the exercises was running [[Currahee Mountain|Currahee]], a large, steep hill whose trail ran \"three miles up, three miles down\". E Company, while training at Toccoa, was under the command of [[Herbert Sobel]], who was known for his extreme strictness.\n\nAlso as part of their physical training, the members of E Company performed formation runs in three-four column running groups. This innovative type of training was adopted by the Army in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAs a result of the harsh physical training Easy Company underwent while at [[Camp Toccoa, Georgia]], the unit was in such impeccable physical condition that they were able to skip the physical training portion of [[United States Army Airborne School | Jump School]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne of its commanders, Major [[Richard Winters]], said E Company originally \"included three rifle platoons and a headquarters section. Each platoon contained three twelve-man rifle squads and a six-man mortar team squad. Easy also had one machine gun attached to each of its rifle squads, and a 60mm mortar in each mortar team.\"<ref>''Beyond Band of Brothers'', pages 16\u201317. {{ISBN|978-0-425-21375-9}}</ref>\n\n==Missions==\n\n===Operation Overlord (D-Day)===\nFor [[Operation Overlord]], E Company's mission was to capture the entrances to and clear any obstacles around \"Causeway 2\", a pre-selected route off [[Utah Beach]] for the Allied forces landing from the sea a few hours later. The company departed from [[RAF Upottery|Upottery airbase]] in Devon, England, and dropped over the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] of Normandy, France in the early hours of the morning of 6 June 1944. [[File:RAF Upottery Memorial.jpg|thumb|The Memorial plaque near RAF Upottery, Devon, UK showing the names of those who died in transit from the base to France on 5 and 7 June 1944.]]\n\nAfter assembling on the ground, the men of E Company [[Brecourt Manor Assault|disabled a battery of four German heavy guns]] on D-Day that threatened forces coming along Causeway 2.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/75-years-from-that-long-day-in-Normandy-we-still-have-something-to-learn-592307 75 years from that long day in Normandy \u2013 we still have something to learn], [[The Jerusalem Post]], 12 June 2019.</ref> The town of [[Carentan]] was crucial for American soldiers to capture because it would link Omaha and Utah beaches together, providing access for armor and equipment. The Germans were aware of its strategic importance and had established significant defences. In one of Donald Malarkey's articles he stated that Lieutenant Winters made him mortar sergeant of second platoon. E Company, along with Dog and Fox companies, were walking down the road to Carentan when they came to an intersection and one or two German machine gun teams began firing on them. Mortars and tanks soon joined the fight. \n\nThe American soldiers all jumped into ditches for cover. Winters saw this and as Malarkey states, Winters \"got hotter than I've ever seen him.\" It was a fast attack, at the end of which Malarkey states that he could hear moans and groans of wounded soldiers and occasional gun shots. Also at the end of the battle Winters was slightly wounded in his lower right leg by a ricocheting bullet fragment. The Germans mounted a counterattack, but 2nd battalion held onto Carentan. By the time the company was pulled off the line, they had taken 65 casualties including 22 [[killed in action]], 17 of which including their [[commanding officer]] and [[first sergeant]], who were killed on D-day when their plane was shot down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryreader.com/modern-history/easy-company-france-d-day/|title=Easy Company in France - After D-Day|website=The History Reader}}</ref>\n\n===Eindhoven, the Netherlands===\nAs part of the ultimately unsuccessful [[Operation Market Garden]], E Company was assigned to support the British forces around [[Eindhoven]] by defending the roads and bridges that would allow British armored divisions to advance into [[Arnhem]] and force a crossing over the major bridge across the [[Rhine]] in September 1944.\n\nE Company landed on its designated drop zone in the Sonsche Forest, north west of [[Son, North Brabant|Son]], and marched down the road into Son behind the 2nd Battalion's other two companies. On reaching the Son Bridge they were met by enemy harassing fire whilst the bridge was destroyed by the Germans. After the Regiment's engineers constructed a makeshift crossing, E and the rest of the 506th moved out for Eindhoven. These events were omitted from the ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' series, with E having been portrayed as landing in the Netherlands and then marching into Eindhoven to join up with the British Army advancing from the south.\n\nOn 19 September, the company departed for [[Helmond]] accompanied by six [[Cromwell tank]]s of the British [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Ambrose127\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 127.</ref> Their advance was halted by the German [[Operation Market Garden order of battle|107th Panzer Brigade]] outside [[Nuenen]] and they were forced to retreat to [[Tongelre]].<ref name=\"Ambrose127\"/> During the days following the link up, E Company successfully defended the towns of [[Veghel]] and [[Uden]] until XXX Corps infantry took up the task of defending the area. As Market Garden progressed, the company and the rest of the 101st joined the 82nd Airborne on \"the island\" north of [[Nijmegen]].\n\nAt the conclusion of Market Garden, the company relieved the British [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] in [[Zetten]].<ref name=\"Ambrose143\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 143.</ref> On 5 October 1944, 1st platoon fought in the battle of \"the island\" that lay between the [[Lower Rhine]] and the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river. Along with a platoon from Fox Company and support from the [[Royal Artillery]], they routed two [[Waffen-SS]] companies on 5 October 1944.<ref name=\"Ambrose149\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 149.</ref> Colonel Sink issued a [[general order]] citing the company's 1st platoon for gallantry in action, describing their attack a \"daring act and skillful maneuver against a numerically superior force\".<ref name=\"Ambrose153\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 153.</ref>\n\nE Company was involved in the rescue of over 100 British troops trapped outside Arnhem. [[Operation Pegasus]] was a military operation carried out on the Lower Rhine near the village of Renkum, close to Arnhem in the Netherlands. Overnight on 22\u201323 October 1944, the Allies evacuated a large group of men trapped in German occupied territory who had been in hiding since the Battle of Arnhem. On the south bank of a Dutch river, Canadian engineers and a patrol of E Company observed the signal and immediately launched their boats, but the British were some 500-800m upriver of the crossing point. \n\nUpon reaching the north bank E Company established a small perimeter while men headed east to locate the evaders.<ref>Ambrose, p159</ref> The men quickly moved downstream and in the next 90 minutes all of them were evacuated,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} with the exception of a Russian who was captured by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Germans opened fire sporadically and some [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds fell near the crossing, but the fire was inaccurate.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Once on the other side the escapees were led to a farmhouse for refreshments, before being driven to Nijmegen where Dobie had arranged a party and champagne.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The men were later flown back to the UK, rejoining the men who had escaped in [[Operation Berlin (Arnhem)|Operation Berlin]]. Nine members of E company were killed in action in Holland with at least 40 wounded.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n[[File:Easy company foy03.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Names of E Company fallen on the monument in [[Foy, Belgium|Foy]]]]\n[[File:Foxholes - Bois Jacques - Bastogne - 03.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the foxholes that still exist in the Jacques Woods, occupied by E Company in December 1944 and January 1945]]\nDuring December 1944 and January 1945, E Company and the rest of the 101st Airborne Division fought in Belgium in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The 101st was in France in December when the Germans launched their offensive in the Ardennes. They were told to hold the vital cross-roads at [[Bastogne]] and were soon encircled by the Germans. E Company fought in cold weather under German artillery fire without winter clothing and with limited rations and ammunition.\n\nBetween the days of 1 to 13 January, the company took control of the Bois Jacques woods in Belgium, between the town of [[Foy, Belgium|Foy]] and Bizory. E Company was assigned to capture the town of Foy.\n\nDivision Headquarters ordered the attack to begin at 0900 hours. During the assault, newly appointed company commander Lieutenant Norman Dike led E Company forward, then ordered 1st platoon (led by Lieutenant Jack Foley) to the left and lost contact with them. Dike ordered the remainder of the company to take cover after coming under fire. With the unit unable to proceed, he was informed by his subordinates that they would get killed if they didn't advance into the town, as they were now unprotected from enemy fire. At the same time, Captain Richard Winters, former company commander and now battalion executive officer, radioed to Dike, telling him the same thing. Dike ordered 1st platoon on a flanking mission around the town,<ref>Ambrose, p.208</ref> and then found cover and froze, ignoring Winters' orders. As Carwood Lipton, first sergeant at the time, later put it: \"He fell apart.\"\n\nAccording to Clancy Lyall, Dike stopped because he had been wounded in the right shoulder (which Lyall saw), not because he had panicked.\n\nIn either case, Dike was immediately relieved by First Lieutenant Ronald Speirs under orders from Captain Winters. To countermand Dike's previous orders, Speirs himself ran through the town and German lines (as 1st platoon had no radio), linked up with the Item Company soldiers and relayed the order.<ref>Ambrose, p.209</ref> Having completed this, he then ran back through the German-occupied town. Carwood Lipton later stated that \"the Germans were so shocked at seeing an American soldier running through their lines - they forgot to shoot!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldspeirs.com/military/ww2/belgium-bastogne/|title=Belgium - Lieutenant Ronald C Speirs|website=ronaldspeirs.com}}</ref> Speirs was reassigned as commanding officer of E Company and remained in that position for the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Winters, p.272\">{{cite book|title=Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters|author=Winters, Richard D., with Cole C.

Afterward, E Company and the rest of the 506th PIR moved into Germany. The 101st Airborne Division was awarded a unit citation for holding the line at Bastogne. E Company suffered 82 casualties including 15 killed in action.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Occupation duties===\nToward the end of the war, E Company was assigned to occupation duty in Germany, specifically to [[Berchtesgaden]], which was home to Adolf Hitler's famous [[Kehlsteinhaus|Eagle's Nest]]. Following Berchtesgaden, the company moved into Austria for further occupation duty. The company mostly attended to various patrols, awaiting the end of the war.\n\n===Postwar===\nE Company and the rest of the 506th PIR was disbanded in November 1945 and reactivated in 1954 as a training unit.

The experiences of its members during [[World War II]] are the subject of the HBO miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' based on [[Band of Brothers (book)|the book]] of the same name by historian [[Stephen Ambrose]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe 506th PIR was an experimental airborne regiment created in 1942 to jump from [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport airplanes into hostile territory.\n \nE Company was established at [[Camp Toccoa]], Georgia. Before attending paratrooper training, the unit's troops performed the standard battle drills and physical training that comes with being in the parachute infantry. One of the exercises was running [[Currahee Mountain|Currahee]], a large, steep hill whose trail ran \"three miles up, three miles down\". E Company, while training at Toccoa, was under the command of [[Herbert Sobel]], who was known for his extreme strictness.\n\nAlso as part of their physical training, the members of E Company performed formation runs in three-four column running groups. This innovative type of training was adopted by the Army in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAs a result of the harsh physical training Easy Company underwent while at [[Camp Toccoa, Georgia]], the unit was in such impeccable physical condition that they were able to skip the physical training portion of [[United States Army Airborne School | Jump School]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne of its commanders, Major [[Richard Winters]], said E Company originally \"included three rifle platoons and a headquarters section. Each platoon contained three twelve-man rifle squads and a six-man mortar team squad. Easy also had one machine gun attached to each of its rifle squads, and a 60mm mortar in each mortar team.\"<ref>''Beyond Band of Brothers'', pages 16\u201317. {{ISBN|978-0-425-21375-9}}</ref>\n\n==Missions==\n\n===Operation Overlord (D-Day)===\nFor [[Operation Overlord]], E Company's mission was to capture the entrances to and clear any obstacles around \"Causeway 2\", a pre-selected route off [[Utah Beach]] for the Allied forces landing from the sea a few hours later. The company departed from [[RAF Upottery|Upottery airbase]] in Devon, England, and dropped over the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] of Normandy, France in the early hours of the morning of 6 June 1944. [[File:RAF Upottery Memorial.jpg|thumb|The Memorial plaque near RAF Upottery, Devon, UK showing the names of those who died in transit from the base to France on 5 and 7 June 1944.]]\n\nAfter assembling on the ground, the men of E Company [[Brecourt Manor Assault|disabled a battery of four German heavy guns]] on D-Day that threatened forces coming along Causeway 2.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/75-years-from-that-long-day-in-Normandy-we-still-have-something-to-learn-592307 75 years from that long day in Normandy \u2013 we still have something to learn], [[The Jerusalem Post]], 12 June 2019.</ref> The town of [[Carentan]] was crucial for American soldiers to capture because it would link Omaha and Utah beaches together, providing access for armor and equipment. The Germans were aware of its strategic importance and had established significant defences. In one of Donald Malarkey's articles he stated that Lieutenant Winters made him mortar sergeant of second platoon. E Company, along with Dog and Fox companies, were walking down the road to Carentan when they came to an intersection and one or two German machine gun teams began firing on them. Mortars and tanks soon joined the fight. \n\nThe American soldiers all jumped into ditches for cover. Winters saw this and as Malarkey states, Winters \"got hotter than I've ever seen him.\" It was a fast attack, at the end of which Malarkey states that he could hear moans and groans of wounded soldiers and occasional gun shots. Also at the end of the battle Winters was slightly wounded in his lower right leg by a ricocheting bullet fragment. The Germans mounted a counterattack, but 2nd battalion held onto Carentan. By the time the company was pulled off the line, they had taken 65 casualties including 22 [[killed in action]], 17 of which including their [[commanding officer]] and [[first sergeant]], who were killed on D-day when their plane was shot down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryreader.com/modern-history/easy-company-france-d-day/|title=Easy Company in France - After D-Day|website=The History Reader}}</ref>\n\n===Eindhoven, the Netherlands===\nAs part of the ultimately unsuccessful [[Operation Market Garden]], E Company was assigned to support the British forces around [[Eindhoven]] by defending the roads and bridges that would allow British armored divisions to advance into [[Arnhem]] and force a crossing over the major bridge across the [[Rhine]] in September 1944.\n\nE Company landed on its designated drop zone in the Sonsche Forest, north west of [[Son, North Brabant|Son]], and marched down the road into Son behind the 2nd Battalion's other two companies. On reaching the Son Bridge they were met by enemy harassing fire whilst the bridge was destroyed by the Germans. After the Regiment's engineers constructed a makeshift crossing, E and the rest of the 506th moved out for Eindhoven. These events were omitted from the ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' series, with E having been portrayed as landing in the Netherlands and then marching into Eindhoven to join up with the British Army advancing from the south.\n\nOn 19 September, the company departed for [[Helmond]] accompanied by six [[Cromwell tank]]s of the British [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Ambrose127\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 127.</ref> Their advance was halted by the German [[Operation Market Garden order of battle|107th Panzer Brigade]] outside [[Nuenen]] and they were forced to retreat to [[Tongelre]].<ref name=\"Ambrose127\"/> During the days following the link up, E Company successfully defended the towns of [[Veghel]] and [[Uden]] until XXX Corps infantry took up the task of defending the area. As Market Garden progressed, the company and the rest of the 101st joined the 82nd Airborne on \"the island\" north of [[Nijmegen]].\n\nAt the conclusion of Market Garden, the company relieved the British [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] in [[Zetten]].<ref name=\"Ambrose143\">Ambrose, Stephen. page 143.</ref> On 5 October 1944, 1st platoon fought in the battle of \"the island\" that lay between the [[Lower Rhine]] and the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river.

[[Operation Pegasus]] was a military operation carried out on the Lower Rhine near the village of Renkum, close to Arnhem in the Netherlands. Overnight on 22\u201323 October 1944, the Allies evacuated a large group of men trapped in German occupied territory who had been in hiding since the Battle of Arnhem. On the south bank of a Dutch river, Canadian engineers and a patrol of E Company observed the signal and immediately launched their boats, but the British were some 500-800m upriver of the crossing point. \n\nUpon reaching the north bank E Company established a small perimeter while men headed east to locate the evaders.<ref>Ambrose, p159</ref> The men quickly moved downstream and in the next 90 minutes all of them were evacuated,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} with the exception of a Russian who was captured by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Germans opened fire sporadically and some [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds fell near the crossing, but the fire was inaccurate.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Once on the other side the escapees were led to a farmhouse for refreshments, before being driven to Nijmegen where Dobie had arranged a party and champagne.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The men were later flown back to the UK, rejoining the men who had escaped in [[Operation Berlin (Arnhem)|Operation Berlin]]. Nine members of E company were killed in action in Holland with at least 40 wounded.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n[[File:Easy company foy03.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Names of E Company fallen on the monument in [[Foy, Belgium|Foy]]]]\n[[File:Foxholes - Bois Jacques - Bastogne - 03.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the foxholes that still exist in the Jacques Woods, occupied by E Company in December 1944 and January 1945]]\nDuring December 1944 and January 1945, E Company and the rest of the 101st Airborne Division fought in Belgium in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The 101st was in France in December when the Germans launched their offensive in the Ardennes. They were told to hold the vital cross-roads at [[Bastogne]] and were soon encircled by the Germans. E Company fought in cold weather under German artillery fire without winter clothing and with limited rations and ammunition.\n\nBetween the days of 1 to 13 January, the company took control of the Bois Jacques woods in Belgium, between the town of [[Foy, Belgium|Foy]] and Bizory. E Company was assigned to capture the town of Foy.\n\nDivision Headquarters ordered the attack to begin at 0900 hours. During the assault, newly appointed company commander Lieutenant Norman Dike led E Company forward, then ordered 1st platoon (led by Lieutenant Jack Foley) to the left and lost contact with them. Dike ordered the remainder of the company to take cover after coming under fire. With the unit unable to proceed, he was informed by his subordinates that they would get killed if they didn't advance into the town, as they were now unprotected from enemy fire. At the same time, Captain Richard Winters, former company commander and now battalion executive officer, radioed to Dike, telling him the same thing. Dike ordered 1st platoon on a flanking mission around the town,<ref>Ambrose, p.208</ref> and then found cover and froze, ignoring Winters' orders. As Carwood Lipton, first sergeant at the time, later put it: \"He fell apart.\"\n\nAccording to Clancy Lyall, Dike stopped because he had been wounded in the right shoulder (which Lyall saw), not because he had panicked.\n\nIn either case, Dike was immediately relieved by First Lieutenant Ronald Speirs under orders from Captain Winters. To countermand Dike's previous orders, Speirs himself ran through the town and German lines (as 1st platoon had no radio), linked up with the Item Company soldiers and relayed the order.<ref>Ambrose, p.209</ref> Having completed this, he then ran back through the German-occupied town. Carwood Lipton later stated that \"the Germans were so shocked at seeing an American soldier running through their lines - they forgot to shoot!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldspeirs.com/military/ww2/belgium-bastogne/|title=Belgium - Lieutenant Ronald C Speirs|website=ronaldspeirs.com}}</ref> Speirs was reassigned as commanding officer of E Company and remained in that position for the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Winters, p.272\">{{cite book|title=Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters|author=Winters, Richard D., with Cole C.

Afterward, E Company and the rest of the 506th PIR moved into Germany. The 101st Airborne Division was awarded a unit citation for holding the line at Bastogne. E Company suffered 82 casualties including 15 killed in action.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Occupation duties===\nToward the end of the war, E Company was assigned to occupation duty in Germany, specifically to [[Berchtesgaden]], which was home to Adolf Hitler's famous [[Kehlsteinhaus|Eagle's Nest]]. Following Berchtesgaden, the company moved into Austria for further occupation duty. The company mostly attended to various patrols, awaiting the end of the war.\n\n===Postwar===\nE Company and the rest of the 506th PIR was disbanded in November 1945 and reactivated in 1954 as a training unit.

It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

Assume that the dishonest man secured a pledge of support from the bosses of the Valley, as he probably would. If the race were close, and the honest man ahead by only a few thousand votes with all of the returns in except from the Valley...the election could easily be stolen by having the Valley counties send in just enough votes to put the dishonest man in office.

How did he use this information in later life? Did LBJ know he had predicted this? Was everyone predicting something like this?
