Others either require or can use a charging station that provides electrical conversion, monitoring, or safety functionality. These stations are also needed when traveling, and many support faster charging at higher [[voltage]]s and [[electric current|currents]] than are available from residential EVSEs. Public charging stations are typically on-street facilities provided by electric utility companies or located at retail shopping centers, restaurants and parking places, operated by a range of private companies.\n\nCharging stations provide a range of heavy duty or special connectors that conform to the variety of standards. For common [[Direct current|DC]] rapid charging, multi-standard chargers equipped with two or three of the [[Combined Charging System]] (CCS), [[CHAdeMO]], and AC fast charging has become the ''de facto'' market standard in many regions.\n\n==Charging station types==\n[[File:Seattle City Light Superintendent Gordon Vickery with prototype electric car, 1973 (34772918810).jpg|thumb|upright|Charging station with [[NEMA connector]] for electric [[AMC Gremlin]] used by [[Seattle City Light]] in 1973 <ref>{{cite book |last=Reardon |first=William A. |title=The energy and resource conservation aspects of electric vehicle utilization for the City of Seattle |date=1973 |publisher=Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories |location=Richland, WA |pages=28\u201329}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Chademo-combo2-iec-type-2-connectors-side-by-side.jpg|thumb|Charging connectors: IEC {{nowrap|Type 4}}/{{wbr}}CHAdeMO (left); CCS {{nowrap|Combo 2}} (centre); IEC {{nowrap|Type 2}} outlet (right)]]\nCharging stations fall into four basic categories:\n\n# Residential charging stations: An EV owner plugs into a standard receptacle (such as [[NEMA connector]] in the US) when he or she returns home, and the car recharges overnight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charging at Home |url= https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/charging-home |website=Energy.gov |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref> A home charging station usually has no user authentication, no separate metering, but may require wiring a dedicated circuit to have faster charging.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stenquist |first=Paul |title=Electric Chargers for the Home Garage |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/business/electric-vehicle-home-chargers.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=11 July 2019 |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref> Some portable chargers can also be wall mounted as charging stations.\n# Charging while parked (including public charging stations) \u2013 a private or commercial venture for a fee or free, sometimes offered in partnership with the owners of the parking lot.

A specified target for [[CARB]] credits for a zero-emission vehicle is adding 200&nbsp;miles (approx. 320&nbsp;km) to its range in under 15 minutes. In 2014, this was not possible for charging electric vehicles, but it is achievable with EV battery swaps. It intends to match the refueling expectations of regular drivers and give crane mobile support for discharged vehicles where there is no charging station.\n\nBattery capacity and the capability of handling faster charging are both increasing, and [[Electric car charging methods|methods of charging]] have needed to change and improve. New options have also been introduced (on a small scale, including mobile charging stations and charging via [[inductive charging]] mats). The differing needs and solutions of various manufacturers has slowed the emergence of standard charging methods, and <span>in 2015, there is a strong recognition of the need for standardization.</span>\n\n==Charging time==\n[[File:2014 BYD E6.jpg|thumb|[[BYD e6]]. Recharging in 15 Minutes to 80 Percent]]\n[[File:BSVAG Solaris Urbino 12 electric \"EMIL\" Hauptbahnhof.jpg|thumb|[[Solaris Urbino]] 12 electric, [[battery electric bus]], inductive charging station]]\n\nThe charging time depends on the battery capacity and the charging power. In simple terms, the time rate of charge depends on the [[charging level]] used, and the charging level depends on the voltage handling of the batteries and charger electronics in the car. The U.S.-based [[SAE International]] defines Level 1 (household 120[[Volts alternating current|V AC]]) as the slowest, Level 2 (upgraded household 240 VAC) in the middle and Level 3 (super charging, 480[[Volts direct current|V DC]] or higher) as the fastest. Level 3 charge time can be as fast as 30 minutes for an 80% charge, although there has been serious industry competition about whose standard should be widely adopted. Charge time can be calculated using the formula: ''Charging Time [h] = Battery Capacity [kWh] / Charging Power [kW]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.homechargingstations.com/buy-ev-home-charging-station/ |title=Guide to buy the right EV home charging station |publisher=Home Charging Stations |location=US |date=2018-01-03 |access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, is about 20&nbsp;kWh, giving it a range of about {{cvt|100|mi}}. [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] was the first company to introduce longer range mass production electric vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40&nbsp;kWh, 60&nbsp;kWh and 85&nbsp;kWh, with the latter having an estimated range of about {{cvt|480|km}}. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have capacity of roughly 3 to 5&nbsp;kWh, for an electrical range of 20 to 40 kilometers, but the gasoline engine ensures the full range of a conventional vehicle.\n\nFor normal charging (up to 7.4&nbsp;kW), car manufacturers have built a battery charger into the car. A charging cable is used to connect it to the electrical network to supply 230&nbsp;volt AC current. For quicker charging (22&nbsp;kW, even 43&nbsp;kW and more), manufacturers have chosen two solutions:\n* Use the vehicle's built-in charger, designed to charge from 3 to 43&nbsp;kW at 230&nbsp;V single-phase or 400&nbsp;V three-phase.\n* Use an external charger, which converts AC current into DC current and charges the vehicle at 50&nbsp;kW (e.g. [[Nissan Leaf]]) or more (e.g. 120-135&nbsp;kW [[Tesla Model S]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Charging time for 100&nbsp;km of [[Electric vehicle battery#Travel range before recharging and trailers|BEV range]]{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n|-\n!

The Blink network of chargers has both Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers and charges separate rates for members and non members. Their prices range from $0.39 to $0.69 per kWh for members and $0.49 to $0.79 per kWh for non members, depending on location.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.blinkcharging.com/ev-charging-fee|title=Electric Vehicle Charging |website=Blink CarCharging|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref> The ChargePoint network has free chargers and paid chargers that drivers activate with a free membership card.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.chargepoint.com/support/driver-faq/|title=Driver FAQ|website=ChargePoint|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> The paid charging stations' prices are based on local rates (similarly to Blink).

Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can readily provide an option for suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* Additional physical \"sensor wires\" which provide a [[feedback]] signal such as specified by the undermentioned [[SAE J1772]] and [[IEC 62196]] schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\n\nUntil 2013, there was an issue where [[ECOtality#Charging stations|Blink chargers]] were overheating and causing damage to both charger and car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/honda-fit-ev-overheats-blink-charger-126246.html |title=Honda Fit EV|work=PluginCars.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://colbytrudeau.com/2012/12/30/dont-blink/ |title=Don\u2019t Blink\u2026 \u2013 A Perfect Fit|work=A Perfect Fit|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The solution employed by the company was to reduce the maximum current.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/20/ecotality-trying-to-fix-charging-station-problems-by-reducing-po/ |title=Ecotality trying to fix charging station problems by reducing power |first=Danny |last= King|work=Autoblog|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Different Charging Modes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n'''IEC 61851-1''' - the International standard for electric vehicle conductive charging system has defined 4 Modes of EV charging. \n\n===Mode 1: Domestic socket and extension cord===\n{{multiple image\n |direction = vertical\n |align     = right\n |width     = 225\n |image1    = Mode1.JPG\n |image2    = Mode2.JPG\n |image3    = Mode3.JPG\n |image4    = Mode4.JPG\n |caption1  = '''Mode 1 :''' Fixed, non-dedicated socket\n |caption2  = '''Mode 2 :''' Non-dedicated socket with cable-incorporated protection device\n |caption3  = '''Mode 3 :''' Fixed, dedicated circuit-socket\n |caption4  = '''Mode 4 :''' DC Connection\n}}\n\nThe vehicle is connected to the power grid through standard socket-outlets present in residences, which depending on the country are usually rated at around 10 A. To use mode 1, the electrical installation must comply with the safety regulations and must have an earthing system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an earth leakage protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.\n\nThe first limitation is the available power, to avoid risks of:\n* Heating of the socket and cables following intensive use for several hours at or near the maximum power (which varies from 8 to 20&nbsp;A depending on the country).\n* Fire or electric injury risks if the electrical installation is obsolete or if certain protective devices are absent.\nThe second limitation is related to the installation's power management.\n* As the charging socket shares a feeder from the switchboard with other sockets (no dedicated circuit) if the sum of consumption exceeds the protection limit (in general 16&nbsp;A), the circuit-breaker will trip, stopping the charging.\n\n===Mode 2: Domestic socket and cable with a protection device===\n\nThe vehicle is connected to the main power grid via household socket-outlets. Charging is done via a single-phase or three-phase network and installation of an earthing cable. A protection device is built into the cable. This solution is more expensive than Mode 1 due to the specificity of the cable.\n\n===Mode 3: Specific socket on a dedicated circuit===\n\nThe vehicle is connected directly to the electrical network via specific socket and plug and a dedicated circuit. A control and protection function is also installed permanently in the installation. This is the only charging mode that meets the applicable standards regulating electrical installations ([[IEC 61851]]). It also allows [[load shedding]] so that electrical household appliances can be operated during vehicle charging or on the contrary optimize the electric vehicle charging time.\n\n===Mode 4: Direct current (DC) connection for fast recharging===\n\nThe electric vehicle is connected to the main power grid through an external charger. Control and protection functions and the vehicle charging cable are installed permanently in the installation.\n\n<br />\n\n== Different Charging Levels ==\nThe '''[[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE)]]''' defines the general physical, electrical, communication and performance requirements for the EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772.

Here the active charging element is inside the car (EV's on-board charger).\n* '''Level 2''': can be from the 240\u00a0V outlet or from a dedicated EV charge point (EVSE) ; AC voltage at 240 V with a maximum current of 80 A and a maximum power of 19.2\u00a0kW. In level-2 also uses the EV's on-board charger.\n* '''Level 3:''' Here, the charger is off-board (meaning the EV's on-board charger is by-passed and the charging station provides DC voltage directly to the battery via a DC connector, with a maximum power of 240 kW.\n\n<br />\n==Public charging stations==\n{{details|topic=the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government|electric vehicle network}}\n\n[[File:BetterPlaceEVsCharging.JPG|thumb|Prototype modified [[Renault Laguna]] E.V. cars charging at Project [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]] charging stations in [[Ramat Hasharon]], Israel, north of [[Tel Aviv]].]]\n[[File:LA EV charging 08 2010 301.JPG|thumb|upright|Public charging stations in a [[parking lot]] near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

One challenge in such infrastructure is the level of demand: an isolated station along a busy highway may see hundreds of customers per hour if every passing electric vehicle has to stop there to complete the trip. In the first half of the 20th century, internal combustion vehicles faced a similar infrastructure problem.\n\nCurrently charging stations are being installed by public authorities, commercial enterprises and some major employers in order to stimulate the market for vehicles that use alternative fuels to gasoline and diesel fuels. For this reason, most charge stations are currently either provided gratis or accessible to members of certain groups without significant charge (e.g. activated by a free \"membership card\" or by a

The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by [[General Electric]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Trucking\u2019s Eclipsed Electric Age|url= https://lostannalsoftransport.wordpress.com/tag/geveco/ |website=The Lost Annals of Transport|publisher=William B.

Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.\n\nBeginning in 1917, a similar successful service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of [[Milburn Electric]] cars, who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.<ref name=HistEV>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|url= https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs|url-access=registration | year = 2000| pages= [https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs/page/153 153\u2013162]| publisher =Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-2809-7}}</ref> A rapid battery replacement system was implemented to keep running 50 electric buses at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://english.bit.edu.cn/NewsEvents/BITNews/16059.htm |title=BIT Attends the Delivery Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games -Alternative Fuel Vehicles|date=2008-07-18|publisher=Beijing Institute of Technology |accessdate=2013-06-02}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] have been involved with integrating battery switch technology with their electric vehicles to extend driving range.<ref name=SwapModelS/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://green.autoblog.com/2010/04/29/report-mitsubishi-working-on-battery-swapping-for-transit-buses/ |title=Mitsubishi working on battery swapping for transit buses, Better Place not involved}}</ref> In a battery switch station, the driver does not need to get out of the car while the battery is swapped.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution-switch-stations |title=Better Place.

Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of Combo 1 or Combo 2 style inlets is normally standardised on a per-country basis, so that public charging providers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2 style vehicle inlets for CCS.\n\nReports emerged in late July 2013 of a significant conflict between the companies responsible for the two types of charging plugs. The Japanese-developed [[CHAdeMO]] standard is favored by [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Toyota]], while the [[SAE J1772]] Combo standard is backed by [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]], [[Volkswagen]], and [[BMW]]. Both are direct-current quick-charging systems designed to charge the battery of an electric vehicle to 80 percent in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are completely incompatible.

Charge time can be calculated using the formula: ''Charging Time [h] = Battery Capacity [kWh] / Charging Power [kW]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.homechargingstations.com/buy-ev-home-charging-station/ |title=Guide to buy the right EV home charging station |publisher=Home Charging Stations |location=US |date=2018-01-03 |access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, is about 20&nbsp;kWh, giving it a range of about {{cvt|100|mi}}. [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] was the first company to introduce longer range mass production electric vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40&nbsp;kWh, 60&nbsp;kWh and 85&nbsp;kWh, with the latter having an estimated range of about {{cvt|480|km}}. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have capacity of roughly 3 to 5&nbsp;kWh, for an electrical range of 20 to 40 kilometers, but the gasoline engine ensures the full range of a conventional vehicle.\n\nFor normal charging (up to 7.4&nbsp;kW), car manufacturers have built a battery charger into the car. A charging cable is used to connect it to the electrical network to supply 230&nbsp;volt AC current. For quicker charging (22&nbsp;kW, even 43&nbsp;kW and more), manufacturers have chosen two solutions:\n* Use the vehicle's built-in charger, designed to charge from 3 to 43&nbsp;kW at 230&nbsp;V single-phase or 400&nbsp;V three-phase.\n* Use an external charger, which converts AC current into DC current and charges the vehicle at 50&nbsp;kW (e.g. [[Nissan Leaf]]) or more (e.g. 120-135&nbsp;kW [[Tesla Model S]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Charging time for 100&nbsp;km of [[Electric vehicle battery#Travel range before recharging and trailers|BEV range]]{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n|-\n!

Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can readily provide an option for suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* Additional physical \"sensor wires\" which provide a [[feedback]] signal such as specified by the undermentioned [[SAE J1772]] and [[IEC 62196]] schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\n\nUntil 2013, there was an issue where [[ECOtality#Charging stations|Blink chargers]] were overheating and causing damage to both charger and car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/honda-fit-ev-overheats-blink-charger-126246.html |title=Honda Fit EV|work=PluginCars.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://colbytrudeau.com/2012/12/30/dont-blink/ |title=Don\u2019t Blink\u2026 \u2013 A Perfect Fit|work=A Perfect Fit|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The solution employed by the company was to reduce the maximum current.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/20/ecotality-trying-to-fix-charging-station-problems-by-reducing-po/ |title=Ecotality trying to fix charging station problems by reducing power |first=Danny |last= King|work=Autoblog|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Different Charging Modes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n'''IEC 61851-1''' - the International standard for electric vehicle conductive charging system has defined 4 Modes of EV charging. \n\n===Mode 1: Domestic socket and extension cord===\n{{multiple image\n |direction = vertical\n |align     = right\n |width     = 225\n |image1    = Mode1.JPG\n |image2    = Mode2.JPG\n |image3    = Mode3.JPG\n |image4    = Mode4.JPG\n |caption1  = '''Mode 1 :''' Fixed, non-dedicated socket\n |caption2  = '''Mode 2 :''' Non-dedicated socket with cable-incorporated protection device\n |caption3  = '''Mode 3 :''' Fixed, dedicated circuit-socket\n |caption4  = '''Mode 4 :''' DC Connection\n}}\n\nThe vehicle is connected to the power grid through standard socket-outlets present in residences, which depending on the country are usually rated at around 10 A. To use mode 1, the electrical installation must comply with the safety regulations and must have an earthing system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an earth leakage protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.\n\nThe first limitation is the available power, to avoid risks of:\n* Heating of the socket and cables following intensive use for several hours at or near the maximum power (which varies from 8 to 20&nbsp;A depending on the country).\n* Fire or electric injury risks if the electrical installation is obsolete or if certain protective devices are absent.\nThe second limitation is related to the installation's power management.\n* As the charging socket shares a feeder from the switchboard with other sockets (no dedicated circuit) if the sum of consumption exceeds the protection limit (in general 16&nbsp;A), the circuit-breaker will trip, stopping the charging.\n\n===Mode 2: Domestic socket and cable with a protection device===\n\nThe vehicle is connected to the main power grid via household socket-outlets. Charging is done via a single-phase or three-phase network and installation of an earthing cable. A protection device is built into the cable. This solution is more expensive than Mode 1 due to the specificity of the cable.\n\n===Mode 3: Specific socket on a dedicated circuit===\n\nThe vehicle is connected directly to the electrical network via specific socket and plug and a dedicated circuit. A control and protection function is also installed permanently in the installation. This is the only charging mode that meets the applicable standards regulating electrical installations ([[IEC 61851]]). It also allows [[load shedding]] so that electrical household appliances can be operated during vehicle charging or on the contrary optimize the electric vehicle charging time.\n\n===Mode 4: Direct current (DC) connection for fast recharging===\n\nThe electric vehicle is connected to the main power grid through an external charger. Control and protection functions and the vehicle charging cable are installed permanently in the installation.\n\n<br />\n\n== Different Charging Levels ==\nThe '''[[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE)]]''' defines the general physical, electrical, communication and performance requirements for the EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772.

Here the active charging element is inside the car (EV's on-board charger).\n* '''Level 2''': can be from the 240\u00a0V outlet or from a dedicated EV charge pint (EVSE) ; AC voltage at 240 V with a maximum current of 80 A and a maximum power of 19.2\u00a0kW. In level-2 also uses the EV's on-board charger.\n* '''Level 3:''' Here, the charger is off-board (meaning the EV's on-board charger is by-passed and the charging station provides DC voltage directly to the battery via a DC connector, with a maximum power of 240 kW.\n\n<br />\n==Public charging stations==\n{{details|topic=the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government|electric vehicle network}}\n\n[[File:BetterPlaceEVsCharging.JPG|thumb|Prototype modified [[Renault Laguna]] E.V. cars charging at Project [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]] charging stations in [[Ramat Hasharon]], Israel, north of [[Tel Aviv]].]]\n[[File:LA EV charging 08 2010 301.JPG|thumb|upright|Public charging stations in a [[parking lot]] near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

One challenge in such infrastructure is the level of demand: an isolated station along a busy highway may see hundreds of customers per hour if every passing electric vehicle has to stop there to complete the trip. In the first half of the 20th century, internal combustion vehicles faced a similar infrastructure problem.\n\nCurrently charging stations are being installed by public authorities, commercial enterprises and some major employers in order to stimulate the market for vehicles that use alternative fuels to gasoline and diesel fuels. For this reason, most charge stations are currently either provided gratis or accessible to members of certain groups without significant charge (e.g. activated by a free \"membership card\" or by a digital \"day code\").\n\n{{As of|2012|12}}, around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.<ref name=Outook2013>{{cite web|url=

It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]], through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by [[General Electric]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Trucking\u2019s Eclipsed Electric Age|url= https://lostannalsoftransport.wordpress.com/tag/geveco/ |website=The Lost Annals of Transport|publisher=William B.

Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.\n\nBeginning in 1917, a similar successful service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of [[Milburn Electric]] cars, who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.<ref name=HistEV>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|url= https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs|url-access=registration | year = 2000| pages= [https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs/page/153 153\u2013162]| publisher =Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-2809-7}}</ref> A rapid battery replacement system was implemented to keep running 50 electric buses at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://english.bit.edu.cn/NewsEvents/BITNews/16059.htm |title=BIT Attends the Delivery Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games -Alternative Fuel Vehicles|date=2008-07-18|publisher=Beijing Institute of Technology |accessdate=2013-06-02}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] have been involved with integrating battery switch technology with their electric vehicles to extend driving range.<ref name=SwapModelS/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://green.autoblog.com/2010/04/29/report-mitsubishi-working-on-battery-swapping-for-transit-buses/ |title=Mitsubishi working on battery swapping for transit buses, Better Place not involved}}</ref> In a battery switch station, the driver does not need to get out of the car while the battery is swapped.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution-switch-stations |title=Better Place.

These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of Combo 1 or Combo 2 style inlets is normally standardised on a per-country basis, so that public charging providers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2 style vehicle inlets for CCS.\n\nReports emerged in late July 2013 of a significant conflict between the companies responsible for the two types of charging plugs. The Japanese-developed [[CHAdeMO]] standard is favored by [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Toyota]], while the [[SAE J1772]] Combo standard is backed by [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]], [[Volkswagen]], and [[BMW]]. Both are direct-current quick-charging systems designed to charge the battery of an electric vehicle to 80 percent in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are completely incompatible. In light of an ongoing feud between the two groups, experts in the field warned that the momentum of the electric vehicle market will be severely affected.<ref>{{cite web|title=EV market threatened by spat over charger standards|url=http://grist.org/news/ev-market-threatened-by-spat-over-charger-standards/?sub_email=sundaybottle%40hotmail.com |work=Grist.org |accessdate=2013-07-29 |first=John |last=Upton |date=2013-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Julia\">{{cite web|title=Charger standards fight confuses electric vehicle buyers, puts car company investments at risk|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059984950|work=ClimateWire|publisher=E&E Publishing, LL|accessdate=2013-07-29 |first=Juliet |last=Pyper|date=2013-07-24}}</ref> Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nFast charging, however and whenever it gets built out, is going to be key for the development of a mainstream market for plug-in electric vehicles.

Location, of course, is important to provide a reference base of the location of the featured information.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s cholera map about the cholera deaths in London in the 1840s, published 1854.]]\nAn important cartographic element preceding thematic mapping was the development of accurate base maps.  Improvements in accuracy proceeded at a gradual pace, and even until the mid-17th century, general maps were usually of poor quality.  Still, base maps around this time were good enough to display appropriate information, allowing for the first thematic maps to come into being.\n\nOne of the earliest thematic maps was a map entitled ''Designatio orbis christiani'' (1607) by [[Jodocus Hondius]] showing the dispersion of major religions, using [[Map symbolization|map symbols]] in the French edition of his ''Atlas Minor'' (1607).<ref name=\"Van der Dussen\">{{cite book|last=Van der Dussen|first=Jan and Kevin Wilson|title=The History of the Idea of Europe|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|page=28}}</ref> This was soon followed by a thematic globe (in the form of a six-[[Gore (segment)|gore]] map) showing the same subject, using Hondius' symbols, by [[Franciscus Haraeus]], entitled: ''Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus'' (1614)<ref>{{cite web|title=Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus 1614|url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/agencypubdetail.jsp?agency=85&publicationId=9202&categoryid=15&subcategoryid=67|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref> \n\nAn early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]] (1656\u20131742).<ref name=\"Thr07\"/> His first significant cartographic contribution was a [[star chart]] of the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere, made during his stay on [[St. Helena]] and published on 1686. In that same year he also published his first [[terrestrial map]] in an article about trade winds, and this map is called the first [[meteorological chart]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&pg=PA97 97]}}</ref> In 1701 he published the \"New and Correct Chart Shewing the Variations of the Compass\", see first image, the first chart to show lines of equal [[magnetic variation]]. \n\nAnother example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]].  Though disease had been mapped thematically, Snow\u2019s cholera map in 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis.  Essentially, his technique and methodology anticipate principles of a geographic information system ([[GIS]]). Starting with an accurate base map of a [[London]] neighborhood which included streets and [[water pump]] locations, Snow mapped out the incidents of [[cholera]] death.  The emerging pattern centered around one particular [[Broad Street pump|pump on Broad Street]].  At Snow\u2019s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once.  Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.\n\nAnother 19th-century example of thematic maps, according to Friendly (2008), was the earliest known [[choropleth map]] in 1826 created by [[Charles Dupin]]. Based on this work [[Louis-L\u00e9ger Vauthier]] (1815\u20131901) developed the population [[contour map]], a map that shows the [[population density]] of Paris in 1874 by contours or [[isolines]].<ref name = \"MF08\">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf \"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization\"].</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n[[File:A-ZStreet.jpg|thumb|Section of a Street/City map from a [[Geographers' A\u2013Z Map Company]] [[Geographers' A\u2013Z Street Atlas|Street Atlas]] ]]\nThematic maps serve three primary purposes. \n# They provide specific information about particular locations.\n# They provide general information about spatial patterns. \n# They can be used to compare patterns on two or more maps. \nCommon examples are maps of demographic data such as population density. When designing a thematic map, cartographers must balance a number of factors in order to effectively represent the data. Besides spatial accuracy, and aesthetics, quirks of human [[visual perception]] and the presentation format must be taken into account.\n\n== Data terminology ==\n\nA thematic map is '''univariate''' if the non-location data is all of the same kind.  Population density, cancer rates, and annual rainfall are three examples of univariate data.\n\n[[Bivariate map]]ping shows the geographical distribution of two distinct sets of data.  For example, a map showing both rainfall and cancer rates may be used to explore a possible correlation between the two phenomena.\n\nMore than two sets of data leads to '''multivariate''' mapping.  For example, a single map might show population density in addition to annual rainfall and cancer rates.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Mapping methods ==\n[[Image:choropleth.gif|thumb|[[Choropleth map]] of water use.]]\n[[Image:January 17 1982 500-Millibar Height Contours.png|thumb|Isarithmic map of [[barometric pressure]].]]\n[[Image:USDA Hardiness zone map.jpg|thumb|Map of climate and plant [[hardiness zones]].]]\nCartographers use many methods to create thematic maps, but five techniques are especially noted.\n\n=== Choropleth ===\n{{main | Choropleth map}}\n[[Choropleth map]]ping shows statistical data aggregated over predefined regions, such as counties or states, by coloring or shading these regions. For example, countries with higher rates of infant mortality might appear darker on a choropleth map. This technique assumes a relatively even distribution of the measured phenomenon within each region. Generally speaking, differences in [[hue]] are used to indicate qualitative differences, such as land use, while differences in saturation or lightness are used to indicate quantitative differences, such as population.\n\n=== Proportional symbol ===\nThe proportional symbol technique uses symbols of different heights, lengths, areas, or volumes to represent data associated with different areas or locations within the map. For example, a disc may be shown at the location of each city in a map, with the area of the disc being proportional to the population of the city. <ref>Using Proportional Symbols [http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//00s500000005000000] ESRI ArcGIS Resources. <small> Accessed 19 Dec 2018 </small> </ref>. This type of map is useful for visualization when raw data cannot be dealt with as a ratio or proportion. Although circles are the most typical symbol because they are more compact due to their low perimeter to area ratio, studies show that it is easier for the reader to estimate the size of the symbol if it is a square or a bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/c3_p14.html |title=3.2 Thematic Maps &#124; GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World |publisher=E-education.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-02-25}}</ref> Proportional symbol maps are effective because they allow the reader to understand large quantities of data in a fast and simple way.\n\n=== Cartogram ===\n{{main|Cartogram}}\n\nA cartogram map is a map that purposely distorts geographic space based on values of a theme. A good example to this would be to make the size of countries proportional to their population. Most commonly used in everyday life are distance cartograms. Distance cartograms show real-world distances that are distorted to reflect some sort of attribute, such as the time between subway stops. Another type of cartogram is an area cartogram. These are created by scaling (or sizing) enumeration units as a function of the values of an attribute associated with the enumeration units. There are two different forms of an area cartogram: contiguous and noncontiguous. A contiguous cartogram tries to retain the contiguity of enumeration units. With noncontiguous cartograms, the shapes of enumeration units are retained, but gaps appear between units. <ref>{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic cartography and geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 19</ref>\n\n=== Isarithmic or isoline===\n{{main|Contour line}}\nIsarithmic maps, also known as [[contour line|contour map]]s or isoline maps depict smooth continuous phenomena such as precipitation or elevation. Each line-bounded area on this type of map represents a region with the same value. For example, on an elevation map, each elevation line indicates an area at the listed elevation. An isarithmic map is a planimetric graphic representation of a 3-D surface. Isarithmic mapping requires 3-D thinking for surfaces that vary spatially.\n\n=== Chorochromatic or Area-class ===\n{{main|Chorochromatic map}}\n\n[[File:Geologic Map of Georgia.png|alt=Geologic map of the U.S. state of Georgia.|thumb|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] geological map of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], an example of a chorochromatic map.]]\nA Chorochromatic or Area-class map represents a categorical or [[Level of measurement | nominal]] variable distributed over space (also known as a discrete [[Field (geography) | field]]), by using different area [[Map symbol | symbols]] (usually color hue) to represent regions of homogeneous value.

Where appropriate, the dot distribution technique may also be used in combination the proportional symbol technique\n\n=== Flow ===\n{{main|Flow map}}\n[[File:FlowMap.png|thumb|Flow map depicting US aid to Africa in 2016.  Source: USAID]]\n[[Flow map]]s are maps that use lines or arrows to portray movement between two or more destinations. These arrows or lines can represent movements of people, migration of animals, monetary aid, or any imports and exports between countries. These lines or arrows can also represent quantities of things being transferred between locations. This can be done via use of proportional symbols.\n\n=== Dasymetric ===\n{{main|Dasymetric map}}\nA [[dasymetric map]] is an alternative to a choropleth map. As with a choropleth map, data are collected by enumeration units. But instead of mapping the data so that the region appears uniform, ''ancillary information'' is used to model internal distribution of the phenomenon. For example, population density will be much lower in forested area than urbanized area, so in a common operation, land cover data (forest, water, grassland, urbanization) may be used to model the distribution of population reported by census enumeration unit such as a tract or county.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 15</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Andr\u00e9-Michel Guerry]]\n*[[Cartogram]]\n* [[Flow map]]\n* [[Nautical chart]]\n* [[Topographic map]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{commons category|Maps by theme}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |first=John |last=Delaney |title=First X, Then Y, Now Z: An Introduction to Landmark Thematic Maps |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/thematic-maps/firstxthenynowz.html |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Library}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Muehrcke |first2=Juliana O. |last2=Muehrcke |first3=A.

Accessed 28 Feb 2009.</ref>\n\nThematic maps are sometimes referred to as graphic essays that portray spatial variations and interrelationships of geographical distributions. Location, of course, is important to provide a reference base of te location of the featured information.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s cholera map about the cholera deaths in London in the 1840s, published 1854.]]\nAn important cartographic element preceding thematic mapping was the development of accurate base maps.  Improvements in accuracy proceeded at a gradual pace, and even until the mid-17th century, general maps were usually of poor quality.  Still, base maps around this time were good enough to display appropriate information, allowing for the first thematic maps to come into being.\n\nOne of the earliest thematic maps was a map entitled ''Designatio orbis christiani'' (1607) by [[Jodocus Hondius]] showing the dispersion of major religions, using [[Map symbolization|map symbols]] in the French edition of his ''Atlas Minor'' (1607).<ref name=\"Van der Dussen\">{{cite book|last=Van der Dussen|first=Jan and Kevin Wilson|title=The History of the Idea of Europe|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|page=28}}</ref> This was soon followed by a thematic globe (in the form of a six-[[Gore (segment)|gore]] map) showing the same subject, using Hondius' symbols, by [[Franciscus Haraeus]], entitled: ''Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus'' (1614)<ref>{{cite web|title=Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus 1614|url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/agencypubdetail.jsp?agency=85&publicationId=9202&categoryid=15&subcategoryid=67|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref> \n\nAn early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]] (1656\u20131742).<ref name=\"Thr07\"/> His first significant cartographic contribution was a [[star chart]] of the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere, made during his stay on [[St. Helena]] and published on 1686. In that same year he also published his first [[terrestrial map]] in an article about trade winds, and this map is called the first [[meteorological chart]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&pg=PA97 97]}}</ref> In 1701 he published the \"New and Correct Chart Shewing the Variations of the Compass\", see first image, the first chart to show lines of equal [[magnetic variation]]. \n\nAnother example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]].  Though disease had been mapped thematically, Snow\u2019s cholera map in 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis.  Essentially, his technique and methodology anticipate principles of a geographic information system ([[GIS]]). Starting with an accurate base map of a [[London]] neighborhood which included streets and [[water pump]] locations, Snow mapped out the incidents of [[cholera]] death.  The emerging pattern centered around one particular [[Broad Street pump|pump on Broad Street]].  At Snow\u2019s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once.  Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.\n\nAnother 19th-century example of thematic maps, according to Friendly (2008), was the earliest known [[choropleth map]] in 1826 created by [[Charles Dupin]]. Based on this work [[Louis-L\u00e9ger Vauthier]] (1815\u20131901) developed the population [[contour map]], a map that shows the [[population density]] of Paris in 1874 by contours or [[isolines]].<ref name = \"MF08\">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf \"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization\"].</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n[[File:A-ZStreet.jpg|thumb|Section of a Street/City map from a [[Geographers' A\u2013Z Map Company]] [[Geographers' A\u2013Z Street Atlas|Street Atlas]] ]]\nThematic maps serve three primary purposes. \n# They provide specific information about particular locations.\n# They provide general information about spatial patterns. \n# They can be used to compare patterns on two or more maps. \nCommon examples are maps of demographic data such as population density. When designing a thematic map, cartographers must balance a number of factors in order to effectively represent the data. Besides spatial accuracy, and aesthetics, quirks of human [[visual perception]] and the presentation format must be taken into account.\n\n== Data terminology ==\n\nA thematic map is '''univariate''' if the non-location data is all of the same kind.  Population density, cancer rates, and annual rainfall are three examples of univariate data.\n\n[[Bivariate map]]ping shows the geographical distribution of two distinct sets of data.  For example, a map showing both rainfall and cancer rates may be used to explore a possible correlation between the two phenomena.\n\nMore than two sets of data leads to '''multivariate''' mapping.  For example, a single map might show population density in addition to annual rainfall and cancer rates.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Mapping methods ==\n[[Image:choropleth.gif|thumb|[[Choropleth map]] of water use.]]\n[[Image:January 17 1982 500-Millibar Height Contours.png|thumb|Isarithmic map of [[barometric pressure]].]]\n[[Image:USDA Hardiness zone map.jpg|thumb|Map of climate and plant [[hardiness zones]].]]\nCartographers use many methods to create thematic maps, but five techniques are especially noted.\n\n=== Choropleth ===\n{{main | Choropleth map}}\n[[Choropleth map]]ping shows statistical data aggregated over predefined regions, such as counties or states, by coloring or shading these regions. For example, countries with higher rates of infant mortality might appear darker on a choropleth map. This technique assumes a relatively even distribution of the measured phenomenon within each region. Generally speaking, differences in [[hue]] are used to indicate qualitative differences, such as land use, while differences in saturation or lightness are used to indicate quantitative differences, such as population.\n\n=== Proportional symbol ===\nThe proportional symbol technique uses symbols of different heights, lengths, areas, or volumes to represent data associated with different areas or locations within the map. For example, a disc may be shown at the location of each city in a map, with the area of the disc being proportional to the population of the city. <ref>Using Proportional Symbols [http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//00s500000005000000] ESRI ArcGIS Resources. <small> Accessed 19 Dec 2018 </small> </ref>. This type of map is useful for visualization when raw data cannot be dealt with as a ratio or proportion. Although circles are the most typical symbol because they are more compact due to their low perimeter to area ratio, studies show that it is easier for the reader to estimate the size of the symbol if it is a square or a bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/c3_p14.html |title=3.2 Thematic Maps &#124; GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World |publisher=E-education.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-02-25}}</ref> Proportional symbol maps are effective because they allow the reader to understand large quantities of data in a fast and simple way.\n\n=== Cartogram ===\n{{main|Cartogram}}\n\nA cartogram map is a map that purposely distorts geographic space based on values of a theme. A good example to this would be to make the size of countries proportional to their population. Most commonly used in everyday life are distance cartograms. Distance cartograms show real-world distances that are distorted to reflect some sort of attribute, such as the time between subway stops. Another type of cartogram is an area cartogram. These are created by scaling (or sizing) enumeration units as a function of the values of an attribute associated with the enumeration units. There are two different forms of an area cartogram: contiguous and noncontiguous. A contiguous cartogram tries to retain the contiguity of enumeration units. With noncontiguous cartograms, the shapes of enumeration units are retained, but gaps appear between units. <ref>{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic cartography and geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 19</ref>\n\n=== Isarithmic or isoline===\n{{main|Contour line}}\nIsarithmic maps, also known as [[contour line|contour map]]s or isoline maps depict smooth continuous phenomena such as precipitation or elevation. Each line-bounded area on this type of map represents a region with the same value. For example, on an elevation map, each elevation line indicates an area at the listed elevation. An isarithmic map is a planimetric graphic representation of a 3-D surface. Isarithmic mapping requires 3-D thinking for surfaces that vary spatially.\n\n=== Chorochromatic or Area-class ===\n{{main|Chorochromatic map}}\n\n[[File:Geologic Map of Georgia.png|alt=Geologic map of the U.S. state of Georgia.|thumb|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] geological map of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], an example of a chorochromatic map.]]\nA Chorochromatic or Area-class map represents a categorical or [[Level of measurement | nominal]] variable distributed over space (also known as a discrete [[Field (geography) | field]]), by using different area [[Map symbol | symbols]] (usually color hue) to represent regions of homogeneous value. Common examples include maps of [[Geologic map | surface geology]], [[Soil map | soil]], [[Land cover | vegetation]], [[Land use | land use]], [[Zoning | city zoning]], and [[Climate classification | climate type]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Menno Jan|last1=Kraak|first2=Ferjan|last2=Ormeling|title=Cartography: Visualization of spatial data|year=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-088890-7|edition=2nd}} p.129</ref>\n\n=== Dot ===\n{{main|Dot distribution map}}\n[[File:Dot Density.png|thumb|Dot density map showing the incidence of malaria in Africa   Source: WHO (2017)]]\nA [[dot distribution map]] might be used to locate each occurrence of a phenomenon, as in the map made by [[John Snow|Dr. Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]], where each dot represented one death due to cholera. Where appropriate, the dot distribution technique may also be used in combination the proportional symbol technique\n\n=== Flow ===\n{{main|Flow map}}\n[[File:FlowMap.png|thumb|Flow map depicting US aid to Africa in 2016.  Source: USAID]]\n[[Flow map]]s are maps that use lines or arrows to portray movement between two or more destinations. These arrows or lines can represent movements of people, migration of animals, monetary aid, or any imports and exports between countries. These lines or arrows can also represent quantities of things being transferred between locations. This can be done via use of proportional symbols.\n\n=== Dasymetric ===\n{{main|Dasymetric map}}\nA [[dasymetric map]] is an alternative to a choropleth map. As with a choropleth map, data are collected by enumeration units. But instead of mapping the data so that the region appears uniform, ''ancillary information'' is used to model internal distribution of the phenomenon. For example, population density will be much lower in forested area than urbanized area, so in a common operation, land cover data (forest, water, grassland, urbanization) may be used to model the distribution of population reported by census enumeration unit such as a tract or county.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 15</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Andr\u00e9-Michel Guerry]]\n*[[Cartogram]]\n* [[Flow map]]\n* [[Nautical chart]]\n* [[Topographic map]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{commons category|Maps by theme}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |first=John |last=Delaney |title=First X, Then Y, Now Z: An Introduction to Landmark Thematic Maps |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/thematic-maps/firstxthenynowz.html |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Library}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Muehrcke |first2=Juliana O. |last2=Muehrcke |first3=A.

It is the third of the four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in golf, and is on the official schedule of both the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[European Tour]]. Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (4 rounds on an 18-hole course), with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes. It is staged by the [[United States Golf Association]] (USGA) in mid-June, scheduled so that, if there are no weather delays, the final round is played on the third Sunday. The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses, set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult, with a premium placed on accurate driving. As of 2019 the U.S. Open awards a $12.5 million purse, the largest of all 4 major championships and tied for largest of all PGA Tour events ([[The Players Championship]] also with $12.5 million).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/news/usga-increases-purses-us-open-us-womens-open |title=USGA increases purses for U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open |work=Golf Channel |first=Will |last=Gray |date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first U.S. Open was played on October 4, 1895, on a nine-hole course at the [[Newport Country Club]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day. Ten professionals and one amateur entered. The winner was [[Horace Rawlins]], a 21-year-old Englishman, who had arrived in the U.S. earlier that year to take up a position at the host club. He received $150 cash out of a prize fund of $335, plus a $50 gold medal; his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy, which was presented by the USGA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/usopen1stwinner.htm|title=First Winner of US Open Golf Tournament|author=Brent Kelley|work=About.com Sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketcity.com/golf-tickets/us-open-golf-tickets/us-open-golf-history.html|title=US Open Golf History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning, the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911, when [[John McDermott (golfer)|John J. McDermott]] became the first native-born American winner. American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four [[men's major golf championships|majors]].\n[[File:US Open Trophy at the 2008 PGA Golf Show.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Open Trophy at the 2008 PGA Golf Show.]]\nSince 1911, the title has been won mostly by players from the United States. Since 1950, players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship, most notably [[South Africa]], which has won five times since 1965. A streak of four consecutive non-American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910. These four players, South African [[Retief Goosen]] (2004), [[New Zealand]]er [[Michael Campbell]] (2005), [[Australia]]n [[Geoff Ogilvy]] (2006) and [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] (2007), are all from countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Northern Ireland's [[Graeme McDowell]] (2010) became the first European player to win the event since [[Tony Jacklin]] of England in 1970; three more Europeans won in the next four editions, making it only three American wins in the 11 tournaments from 2004-2014.\n\nU.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders, with the winner usually emerging at around even par. A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely, and there have been many over-par wins (in part because par is usually set at 70, except for the very longest courses). Normally, an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough (termed \"Open rough\" by the American press and fans); undulating greens (such as at [[Pinehurst Resort|Pinehurst No. 2]] in 2005, which was described by [[Johnny Miller]] of [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]] as \"like trying to hit a ball on top of a [[VW Beetle]]\"); pinched fairways (especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes); and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament (often to meet that frequently used par of 70, forcing players to have accurate long drives). Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U.S. Open will undergo renovations to develop these features. [[Rees Jones]] is the most notable of the \"Open Doctors\" who take on these projects; his father [[Robert Trent Jones]] had filled that role earlier.

Note that this tournament typically takes place after the collegiate season has ended, so players may turn professional immediately after their last collegiate event (typically the end of the NCAA final of their senior year) in order to maximize the number of FedEx Cup points they may score before the August cutoff.<ref name=\"2019 changes\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/articles/2019/08/exemption-changes-u-s--amateur-women-s-amateur-professional-golf.html |title=New Exemption Changes for U.S. Women's and U.S. Amateur |publisher=USGA |date=August 5, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBefore 2011, the sole OWGR cutoff for entry was the top 50 as of two weeks before the tournament.

Firstly there is Local Qualifying, which is played over 18 holes at more than 100 courses around the United States. Many leading players are exempt from this first stage, and they join the successful local qualifiers at the Sectional Qualifying stage, which is played over 36 holes in one day at several sites in the U.S., as well as one each in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]].

The [[European Tour]] uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai (\u20ac10,745,927 in 2017).\n\nIn line with the other majors, winning the U.S. Open gives a golfer several privileges that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the elite players of the sport. U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[The Open Championship]] (British Open), and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years. They are also automatically invited to play in [[The Players Championship]] for the next five years, and they are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open itself for 10 years.\n\nWinners may also receive a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour, which is automatic for regular members. Non-PGA Tour members who win the U.S. Open have the choice of joining the PGA Tour either within 60 days of winning, or prior to the beginning of any one of the next five tour seasons.\n\nFinally, U.S. Open winners receive automatic invitations to three of the five [[senior major golf championships|senior majors]] once they turn 50; they receive a five-year invitation to the [[U.S. Senior Open]] and a lifetime invitation to the [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Senior Open Championship|Senior British Open]].\n\nThe top 10 finishers at the U.S. Open are fully exempt from qualifying for the following year's Open, and the top four are automatically invited to the following season's Masters.\n\n==Playoff format==\nUp to 2017, the U.S. Open retained a full 18-hole playoff the following day (Monday). If a tie existed after that fifth round, then the playoff continued as [[Playoff (golf)|sudden-death]] on the 91st hole. The U.S. Open advanced to sudden-death three times ([[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990]], [[1994 U.S. Open (golf)|1994]], [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008]]), most recently when [[Tiger Woods]] defeated [[Rocco Mediate]] on the first additional playoff hole in 2008. Before sudden-death was introduced in the 1950s, additional 18-hole rounds were played ([[1925 U.S. Open (golf)|1925]], [[1939 U.S. Open (golf)|1939]], and [[1946 U.S. Open (golf)|1946]]) to break the tie. When the playoff was scheduled for 36 holes and ended in a tie, as in [[1931 U.S. Open (golf)|1931]], a second 36-hole playoff was required.\n\nSince 2018, the [[USGA]] adopted a two-hole aggregate playoff format, after consulting fans, players and media partners. Sudden death will still be played if the playoff ends tied.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22586395/us-open-abandons-18-holes-2-hole-playoff |title=U.S. Open abandons 18 holes for 2-hole playoff |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=February 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Champions==\n{{Main|List of U.S. Open (golf) champions}}\n\n[[Willie Anderson (golfer)|Willie Anderson]], [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], [[Ben Hogan]] and [[Jack Nicklaus]] hold the record for the most U.S. Open victories, with four victories each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usopen.com/2007/history/usopen_records.html#champions |title=Champions |publisher=U.S. Open |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303210811/http://www.usopen.com/2007/history/usopen_records.html#champions |archivedate=March 3, 2008}}</ref> [[Hale Irwin]] is the oldest winner of the U.S. Open at 45 years and 15 days in [[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990]].<ref name=\"age\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usopen.com/2007/history/usopen_records.html#age |title=Age |publisher=U.S. Open |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303210811/http://www.usopen.com/2007/history/usopen_records.html#age |archivedate=March 3, 2008}}</ref> The youngest winner of the U.S. Open is [[John McDermott (golfer)|John McDermott]] at 19 years, 10 months, 14 days in [[1911 U.S. Open (golf)|1911]].<ref name=\"age\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year !!

States. It is the third of the four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in golf, and is on the official schedule of both the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[European Tour]]. Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (4 rounds on an 18-hole course), with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes. It is staged by the [[United States Golf Association]] (USGA) in mid-June, scheduled so that, if there are no weather delays, the final round is played on the third Sunday. The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses, set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult, with a premium placed on accurate driving. As of 2019 the U.S. Open awards a $12.5 million purse, the largest of all 4 major championships and tied for largest of all PGA Tour events ([[The Players Championship]] also with $12.5 million).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/news/usga-increases-purses-us-open-us-womens-open |title=USGA increases purses for U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open |work=Golf Channel |first=Will |last=Gray |date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first U.S. Open was played on October 4, 1895, on a nine-hole course at the [[Newport Country Club]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day. Ten professionals and one amateur entered. The winner was [[Horace Rawlins]], a 21-year-old Englishman, who had arrived in the U.S. earlier that year to take up a position at the host club. He received $150 cash out of a prize fund of $335, plus a $50 gold medal; his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy, which was presented by the USGA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/usopen1stwinner.htm|title=First Winner of US Open Golf Tournament|author=Brent Kelley|work=About.com Sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketcity.com/golf-tickets/us-open-golf-tickets/us-open-golf-history.html|title=US Open Golf History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning, the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911, when [[John McDermott (golfer)|John J. McDermott]] became the first native-born American winner. American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four [[men's major golf championships|majors]].\n[[File:US Open Trophy at the 2008 PGA Golf Show.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Open Trophy at the 2008 PGA Golf Show.]]\nSince 1911, the title has been won mostly by players from the United States. Since 1950, players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship, most notably [[South Africa]], which has won five times since 1965. A streak of four consecutive non-American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910. These four players, South African [[Retief Goosen]] (2004), [[New Zealand]]er [[Michael Campbell]] (2005), [[Australia]]n [[Geoff Ogilvy]] (2006) and [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] (2007), are all from countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Northern Ireland's [[Graeme McDowell]] (2010) became the first European player to win the event since [[Tony Jacklin]] of England in 1970; three more Europeans won in the next four editions, making it only three American wins in the 11 tournaments from 2004-2014.\n\nU.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders, with the winner usually emerging at around even par. A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely, and there have been many over-par wins (in part because par is usually set at 70, except for the very longest courses). Normally, an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough (termed \"Open rough\" by the American press and fans); undulating greens (such as at [[Pinehurst Resort|Pinehurst No. 2]] in 2005, which was described by [[Johnny Miller]] of [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]] as \"like trying to hit a ball on top of a [[VW Beetle]]\"); pinched fairways (especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes); and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament (often to meet that frequently used par of 70, forcing players to have accurate long drives). Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U.S. Open will undergo renovations to develop these features. [[Rees Jones]] is the most notable of the \"Open Doctors\" who take on these projects; his father [[Robert Trent Jones]] had filled that role earlier. As with any professional golf tournament, the available space surrounding the course (for spectators, among other considerations) and local infrastructure also factor into deciding which courses will host the event.\n\n==Qualification==\nThe U.S. Open is open to any professional, or to any amateur with a USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 1.4.<ref name=entry>{{cite web |title=112th U.S. Open Championship application form |url=https://champs.usga.org/EntryForms/usopen_2012.pdf |publisher=USGA |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525062640/https://champs.usga.org/EntryForms/usopen_2012.pdf |archivedate=May 25, 2013 }}</ref> Players (male or female)<ref name=entry/> may obtain a place by being fully exempt or by competing successfully in qualifying.

On August 5, 2019, the USGA announced a rule change stating a player may turn professional and still retain his U.S. Open exemption. Note that this tournament typically takes place after the collegiate season has ended, so players may turn professional immediately after their last collegiate event (typically the end of the NCAA final of their senior year) in order to maximize the number of FedEx Cup points they may score before the August cutoff.<ref name=\"2019 changes\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/articles/2019/08/exemption-changes-u-s--amateur-women-s-amateur-professional-golf.html |title=New Exemption Changes for U.S. Women's and U.S. Amateur |publisher=USGA |date=August 5, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBefore 2011, the sole OWGR cutoff for entry was the top 50 as of two weeks before the tournament. An exemption category for the top 50 as of the tournament date was added for 2011, apparently in response to the phenomenon of golfers entering the top 50 between the original cutoff date and the tournament (such as [[Justin Rose]] and [[Rickie Fowler]] in 2010).<ref name=\"2011 changes\">{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=6093060 |title=U.S. Open to expand world-ranking use |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN |date=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThrough 2011, exemptions existed for leading money winners on the PGA, European, Japanese, and Australasian tours, as well as winners of multiple PGA Tour events in the year before the U.S. Open. These categories were eliminated in favor of inviting the top 60 on the OWGR at both relevant dates.<ref name=\"2011 changes\"/> Starting with the 2012 championship, an exemption was added for the winner of the current year's BMW PGA Championship, the European Tour's equivalent of The Players Championship.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.usga.org/news/2011/February/Changes-Made-To-Exemption-Categories/ |title=USGA Announces Changes To Exemption Categories |publisher=USGA |date=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPotential competitors who are not fully exempt must enter the Qualifying process, which has two stages. Firstly there is Local Qualifying, which is played over 18 holes at more than 100 courses around the United States. Many leading players are exempt from this first stage, and they join the successful local qualifiers at the Sectional Qualifying stage, which is played over 36 holes in one day at several sites in the U.S., as well as one each in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. There is no lower age limit and the youngest-ever qualifier was 14-year-old [[Andy Zhang]] of [[China]], who qualified in 2012 after [[Paul Casey]] withdrew days before the tournament.\n\n===USGA special exemptions===\nThe USGA has granted a special exemption to 34 players 52 times since [[1966 U.S. Open (golf)|1966]].<ref name=\"usga exemptions\">{{cite web |url=http://usga.org/uploadedFiles/USGAHome/press_room/media_guide/U.S.%20Open.pdf |title=2012 U.S. Open Championship Media Guide |page=31 |publisher=[[United States Golf Association]] |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522201736/http://www.usga.org/uploadedFiles/USGAHome/press_room/media_guide/U.S.%20Open.pdf |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Players with multiple special exemptions include: [[Arnold Palmer]] (1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1994), [[Seve Ballesteros]] (1978, 1994), [[Gary Player]] (1981, 1983), [[Lee Trevino]] (1983, 1984), [[Hale Irwin]] (1990, 2002, 2003), [[Jack Nicklaus]] (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000), [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]] (1993, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2010).<ref name=\"usga exem2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/media/online-media-center/usga-records/u-s--open--special-exemptions.html |title=U.S. Open: Special Exemptions |publisher=USGA |date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIrwin won the [[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990 U.S. Open]] after accepting a special exemption. In the [[2016 U.S. Open (golf)|2016]], a special exemption was extended to former champion [[Retief Goosen]] (2001, 2004).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/two-time-champ-goosen-gets-us-open-exemption/ |title=Two-time champ Goosen gets U.S. Open exemption |work=Golf Channel |first=Will |last=Gray |date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> In [[2018 U.S. Open (golf)|2018]], a special exemption was extended to former U.S. Open champions [[Jim Furyk]] (2003) and [[Ernie Els]] (1994, 1997).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/usga-gives-ernie-els-jim-furyk-special-exemptions-into-2018-us-open-at-shinnecock-hills |title=USGA gives Ernie Els, Jim Furyk special exemptions into 2018 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills |magazine=Golf Digest |first=Ryan |last=Herrington |date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\nThe purse at the 2017 U.S. Open was $12&nbsp;million, and the winner's share was $2.16&nbsp;million. The [[European Tour]] uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai (\u20ac10,745,927 in 2017).\n\nIn line with the other majors, winning the U.S. Open gives a golfer several privileges that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the elite players of the sport. U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[The Open Championship]] (British Open), and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years. They are also automatically invited to play in [[The Players Championship]] for the next five years, and they are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open itself for 10 years.\n\nWinners may also receive a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour, which is automatic for regular members. Non-PGA Tour members who win the U.S. Open have the choice of joining the PGA Tour either within 60 days of winning, or prior to the beginning of any one of the next five tour seasons.\n\nFinally, U.S. Open winners receive automatic invitations to three of the five [[senior major golf championships|senior majors]] once they turn 50; they receive a five-year invitation to the [[U.S. Senior Open]] and a lifetime invitation to the [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Senior Open Championship|Senior British Open]].\n\nThe top 10 finishers at the U.S. Open are fully exempt from qualifying for the following year's Open, and the top four are automatically invited to the following season's Masters.\n\n==Playoff format==\nUp to 2017, the U.S. Open retained a full 18-hole playoff the following day (Monday). If a tie existed after that fifth round, then the playoff continued as [[Playoff (golf)|sudden-death]] on the 91st hole. The U.S. Open advanced to sudden-death three times ([[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990]], [[1994 U.S. Open (golf)|1994]], [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008]]), most recently when [[Tiger Woods]] defeated [[Rocco Mediate]] on the first additional playoff hole in 2008. Before sudden-death was introduced in the 1950s, additional 18-hole rounds were played ([[1925 U.S. Open (golf)|1925]], [[1939 U.S. Open (golf)|1939]], and [[1946 U.S. Open (golf)|1946]]) to break the tie. When the playoff was scheduled for 36 holes and ended in a tie, as in [[1931 U.S. Open (golf)|1931]], a second 36-hole playoff was required.\n\nSince 2018, the [[USGA]] adopted a two-hole aggregate playoff format, after consulting fans, players and media partners.

However, after many Allied victories and following the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan]] on August 9, 1945, and subsequent [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] and other territories, and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the Empire surrendered to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on August 15, 1945. A [[Occupation of Japan|period of occupation]] by the Allies followed. In 1947, with American involvement, a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] was enacted, officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end. Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952, eventually forming the [[Post-occupation Japan|current]] constitutional monarchy known as [[Japan]].\n\nThe [[Emperor of Japan|Emperors]] during this time, which spanned the entire [[Meiji (era)|Meiji]], [[Taish\u014d]], and the lesser part of the [[Sh\u014dwa (1926\u20131989)|Sh\u014dwa]] era, are now known in Japan by their [[posthumous name]]s, which coincide with those era names: [[Emperor Meiji]] (Mutsuhito), [[Emperor Taish\u014d]] (Yoshihito), and [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] (Hirohito).\n\n==Terminology==\nThe historical state is frequently referred to as the \"Empire of Japan\", the \"Japanese Empire\", or \"Imperial Japan\" in English. In Japanese it is referred to as {{Nihongo|''Dai Nippon Teikoku''|\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u56fd}},<ref name=\"Shillony\" /> which translates to \"Empire of Great Japan\" ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5927#Japanese|Dai]]}} \"Great\", {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u65e5\u672c#Japanese|Nippon]]}} \"Japanese\", {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5e1d\u56fd#Japanese|Teikoku]]}} \"Empire\"). ''Teikoku'' is itself composed of the nouns {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5e1d#Japanese|Tei]]}} \"referring to an emperor\" and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u56fd#Japanese|-koku]]}} \"nation, state\", so literally \"Imperial State\" or \"Imperial Realm\" (compare the [[German language|German]] ''[[German Empire|Kaiserreich]]'').\n\nThis meaning is significant in terms of geography, encompassing Japan and its surrounding areas. The nomenclature ''Empire of Japan'' had existed since the anti-Tokugawa domains, [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], which founded their new government during the [[Meiji Restoration]], with the intention of forming a modern state to resist Western domination.\n\nDue to its name in ''[[kanji]]'' characters and its flag, it was also given the [[exonym]] \"Empire of the Sun\".\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nAfter two centuries, the seclusion policy, or ''[[sakoku]]'', under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'' of the [[Edo period]] came to an end when the country was forced open to trade by the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854. Thus, the period known as [[Bakumatsu]] began.\n\nThe following years saw increased foreign trade and interaction; commercial treaties between the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and Western countries were signed. In large part due to the humiliating terms of these [[unequal treaties]], the shogunate soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical, [[xenophobic]] movement, the ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (literally \"Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\").<ref>Hagiwara, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn March 1863, the Emperor issued the \"[[order to expel barbarians]]\". Although the shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, it nevertheless inspired attacks against the shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan. The [[Namamugi Incident]] during 1862 led to the murder of an Englishman, [[Charles Lennox Richardson]], by a party of [[samurai]] from [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]]. The British demanded reparations but were denied. While attempting to exact payment, the Royal Navy was fired on from coastal batteries near the town of [[Kagoshima]]. They responded by [[Bombardment of Kagoshima|bombarding the port of Kagoshima]] in 1863. The Tokugawa government agreed to pay an indemnity for Richardson's death.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|pp=314\u2013315}} Shelling of foreign shipping in Shimonoseki and attacks against foreign property led to the [[bombardment of Shimonoseki]] by a multinational force in 1864.<ref>Hagiwara, p. 35.</ref> The Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan also launched the failed coup known as the [[Kinmon incident]]. The [[Satch\u014d Alliance|Satsuma-Ch\u014dsh\u016b alliance]] was established in 1866 to combine their efforts to overthrow the Tokugawa bakufu. In early 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died of smallpox and was replaced by his son, Crown Prince Mutsuhito (Meiji).\n\nOn November 9, 1867, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] resigned from his post and authorities to the [[Emperor Meiji|Emperor]], agreeing to \"be the instrument for carrying out\" imperial orders.<ref>Satow, p. 282.</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate had ended.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=116}}{{sfn|Jansen|2002|pp=310\u2013311}} However, while Yoshinobu's resignation had created a nominal void at the highest level of government, his apparatus of state continued to exist. Moreover, the shogunal government, the Tokugawa family in particular, remained a prominent force in the evolving political order and retained many executive powers,<ref>Keene, pp. 120\u2013121, and Satow, p. 283. Moreover, Satow (p. 285) speculates that Yoshinobu had agreed to an assembly of ''daimy\u014ds'' in the hope that such a body would reinstate him.</ref> a prospect hard-liners from Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b found intolerable.<ref>Satow, p. 286.</ref>\n\nOn January 3, 1868, Satsuma-Ch\u014dsh\u016b forces seized the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|imperial palace]] in [[Kyoto]], and the following day had the fifteen-year-old [[Emperor Meiji]] declare his own restoration to full power. Although the majority of the imperial consultative assembly was happy with the formal declaration of direct rule by the court and tended to support a continued collaboration with the Tokugawa, Saig\u014d Takamori threatened the assembly into abolishing the title ''sh\u014dgun'' and ordered the confiscation of Yoshinobu's lands.<ref>During a recess, Saig\u014d, who had his troops outside, \"remarked that it would take only one short sword to settle the discussion\" (Keene, p. 122). Original quotation (Japanese): \"\u77ed\u5200\u4e00\u672c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u304b\u305f\u3065\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3060.\" in Hagiwara, p. 42. The word used for \"dagger\" was ''tant\u014d''.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu declared \"that he would not be bound by the proclamation of the Restoration and called on the court to rescind it\".<!-- Why is this quoted? -->{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=124}} On January 24, Yoshinobu decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arson attacks in Edo, starting with the burning of the outworks of [[Edo Castle]], the main Tokugawa residence.\n\n===Boshin War===\n{{Main|Boshin War}}\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Hakodate.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Naval Battle of Hakodate]], May 1869; in the foreground, {{ship|Japanese warship|Kasuga||2}} and {{ship|Japanese ironclad|K\u014dtetsu||2}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy]]\n\nThe {{nihongo|Boshin War|\u620a\u8fb0\u6226\u4e89|Boshin Sens\u014d}} was fought between January 1868 and May 1869. The alliance of samurai from southern and western domains and court officials had now secured the cooperation of the young Emperor Meiji, who ordered the dissolution of the two-hundred-year-old Tokugawa shogunate. Tokugawa Yoshinobu launched a military campaign to seize the emperor's court at Kyoto. However, the tide rapidly turned in favor of the smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction and resulted in defections of many ''daimy\u014ds'' to the Imperial side. The [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] was a decisive victory in which a combined army from Ch\u014dsh\u016b, Tosa, and Satsuma domains defeated the Tokugawa army.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|p=312}} A series of battles were then fought in pursuit of supporters of the Shogunate; Edo surrendered to the Imperial forces and afterwards Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Yoshinobu was stripped of all his power by Emperor Meiji and most of Japan accepted the emperor's rule.\n\nPro-Tokugawa remnants, however, then retreated to northern Honsh\u016b ([[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]) and later to Ezo (present-day [[Hokkaid\u014d]]), where they established the breakaway [[Republic of Ezo]]. An expeditionary force was dispatched by the new government and the Ezo Republic forces were overwhelmed. The [[Battle of Hakodate|siege of Hakodate]] came to an end in May 1869 and the remaining forces surrendered.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|p=312}}\n\n==Meiji era (1868\u20131912)==\n{{Main|Meiji period|Meiji Restoration|Government of Meiji Japan}}\n\nThe [[Charter Oath]] was made public at the enthronement of Emperor Meiji of Japan on April 7, 1868. The Oath outlined the main aims and the course of action to be followed during Emperor Meiji's reign, setting the legal stage for Japan's modernization.<ref>Keene, p. 340, notes that one might \"describe the Oath in Five Articles as a constitution for all ages\".</ref> The [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leaders]] also aimed to boost morale and win financial support for the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]].\n\n[[File:Iwakura mission.jpg|thumb|left|Prominent members of the Iwakura mission. Left to right: [[Kido Takayoshi]], Yamaguchi Masuka, [[Iwakura Tomomi]], [[It\u014d Hirobumi]], [[\u014ckubo Toshimichi]]]]\n\nJapan dispatched the [[Iwakura Mission]] in 1871. The mission traveled the world in order to renegotiate the [[unequal treaties]] with the United States and European countries that Japan had been forced into during the Tokugawa shogunate, and to gather information on western social and economic systems, in order to effect the modernization of Japan. Renegotiation of the unequal treaties was universally unsuccessful, but close observation of the American and European systems inspired members on their return to bring about modernization initiatives in Japan. Japan made a [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|territorial delimitation treaty]] with Russia in 1875, gaining all the [[Kuril islands]] in exchange for [[Sakhalin island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.go.jp/ayumi/kobetsu/m08_1875_02.html|title=\u660e\u6cbb8\u5e74\uff081875\uff094\u6708\uff5c\u6f38\u6b21\u7acb\u61b2\u653f\u4f53\u6a39\u7acb\u306e\u8a54\u304c\u767a\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5143\u8001\u9662\u30fb\u5927\u5be9\u9662\u304c\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u3042\u3086\u307f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSeveral prominent writers, under the constant threat of assassination from their political foes, were influential in winning Japanese support for [[westernization]]. One such writer was [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]], whose works included \"Conditions in the West,\" \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", and \"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization,\" which detailed Western society and his own philosophies. In the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, military and economic power was emphasized. Military strength became the means for national development and stability. Imperial Japan became the only non-Western [[world power]] and a major force in [[East Asia]] in about 25 years as a result of industrialization and economic development.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Emperor Meiji]], the 122nd emperor of Japan|alt=]]\n\nAs writer [[Albrecht von Urach|Albrecht F\u00fcrst von Urach]] comments in his booklet \"The Secret of Japan's Strength,\" published in 1942, during the [[Axis powers]] period:\n<blockquote>The rise of Japan to a world power during the past 80 years is the greatest miracle in world history. The mighty empires of antiquity, the major political institutions of the Middle Ages and the early modern era, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire, all needed centuries to achieve their full strength. Japan's rise has been meteoric. After only 80 years, it is one of the few great powers that determine the fate of the world.<ref>[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/japan.htm The Secret of Japan's Strength] www.calvin.edu</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe sudden westernization, once it was adopted, changed almost all areas of Japanese society, ranging from armaments, arts, education, etiquette, fashion, health, justice, politics, language, etc. The Japanese government sent students to Western countries to observe and learn their practices, and also paid \"[[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|foreign advisors]]\" in a variety of fields to come to Japan to educate the populace. For instance, the judicial system and constitution were largely modeled on those of Prussia. The government also outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past, such as publicly displaying and wearing [[katana]] and the [[Chonmage|top knot]], both of which were characteristic of the [[samurai]] class, which was abolished together with the caste system. This would later bring the Meiji government into [[Satsuma Rebellion|conflict with the samurai]].\n\n===Transposition in social order===\n{{Main|Japanese new religions#Before World War II|Christianity in Japan#Opening of Japan|History of the Catholic Church in Japan#Rediscovery and return}}\n{{seealso|Turanism}}\n\nIn the 1860s, Japan began to experience great social turmoil and rapid modernization. As social conflicts emerged in this last decade of the [[Edo period]], some new religious movements appeared, which were directly influenced by [[shamanism]] and [[Shinto]].\n\nThe social tension continued to grow during the [[Meiji period]], affecting religious practices and institutions. Conversion from traditional faith was no longer legally forbidden, officials lifted the 250-year ban on Christianity, and missionaries of established Christian churches reentered Japan. The traditional [[syncreticism]] between Shinto and [[Buddhism]] ended. Losing the protection of the Japanese government which Buddhism had enjoyed for centuries, Buddhist monks faced radical difficulties in sustaining their institutions, but their activities also became less restrained by governmental policies and restrictions.\n\n[[File:\u00c9glise des Vingt-Six-Martyrs de Nagazaki.JPG|thumb|left|[[Basilica of the Twenty-Six Holy Martyrs of Japan (Nagasaki)|\u014cura Church]], [[Nagasaki]], 1885]]\n\nEmperor Ogimachi issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568, but to little effect. Beginning in 1587 with imperial regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ban on Jesuit missionaries, Christianity was repressed as a threat to national unity. Under Hideyoshi and the succeeding [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Catholic Christianity was repressed and adherents were persecuted. After the Tokugawa shogunate banned Christianity in 1620, it ceased to exist publicly. Many Catholics went underground, becoming {{nihongo|hidden Christians|\u96a0\u308c\u30ad\u30ea\u30b7\u30bf\u30f3|kakure kirishitan}}, while others lost their lives. After Japan was opened to foreign powers in 1853, many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches, though proselytism was still banned. Only after the Meiji Restoration, was Christianity re-established in Japan. Freedom of religion was introduced in 1871, giving all Christian communities the right to legal existence and preaching.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was brought to Japan in the 19th century by St. Nicholas (baptized as Ivan Dmitrievich Kasatkin),<ref name=\"snow\">''Equal-to-the-Apostles St. Nicholas of Japan, Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist web-site, Washington D.C.''</ref> who was sent in 1861 by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to [[Hakodate]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] as priest to a chapel of the Russian Consulate.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.orthodoxjapan.jp/daishukyou.html |title = \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6b63\u6559\u4f1a\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3 \"History of Japanese Orthodox Charch and Now\" |accessdate = 2007-08-25 |date = 2007-02-01 |publisher = The Orthodox Church in Japan |language = Japanese}}</ref> St. Nicholas of Japan made his own translation of the [[New Testament]] and some other religious books ([[Triodion|Lenten Triodion]], [[Pentecostarion]], [[Liturgy|Feast Services]], [[Book of Psalms]], [[Irmologion]]) into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>''Orthodox translation of Gospel into Japanese, Pravostok Orthodox Portal, October 2006''</ref> Nicholas has since been canonized as a saint by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1970, and is now recognized as St. Nicholas, [[Equal-to-the-Apostles]] to Japan. His commemoration day is February 16. [[Andronic Nikolsky]], appointed the first Bishop of [[Kyoto]] and later martyred as the archbishop of [[Perm]] during the Russian Revolution, was also canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church as a Saint and Martyr in the year 2000.\n\n[[Divie Bethune McCartee]] was the first ordained [[Presbyterian]] minister [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]ary to visit Japan, in 1861\u20131862. His gospel [[Tract (literature)|tract]] translated into Japanese was among the first Protestant literature in Japan. In 1865, McCartee moved back to [[Ningbo]], China, but others have followed in his footsteps. There was a burst of growth of Christianity in the late 19th century when Japan re-opened its doors to the West. Protestant church growth slowed dramatically in the early 20th century under the influence of the military government during the [[Sh\u014dwa period]].\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the government was suspicious towards a number of unauthorized religious movements and periodically made attempts to suppress them. Government suppression was especially severe from the 1930s until the early 1940s, when the growth of [[Japanese nationalism]] and [[State Shinto]] were closely linked. Under the Meiji regime ''[[l\u00e8se majest\u00e9]]'' prohibited insults against the Emperor and his Imperial House, and also against some major Shinto shrines which were believed to be tied strongly to the Emperor. The government strengthened its control over religious institutions that were considered to undermine State Shinto or nationalism.\n\n===Political reform===\n{{Main|Meiji Constitution}}\n{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Interior of the Japanese Parliament, showing the Prime Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House, 1915]]\n\nThe idea of a written constitution had been a subject of heated debate within and outside of the government since the beginnings of the [[Meiji government]]. The conservative [[Meiji oligarchy]] viewed anything resembling [[democracy]] or [[republicanism]] with suspicion and trepidation, and favored a gradualist approach. The [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] demanded the immediate establishment of an elected [[national assembly]], and the promulgation of a constitution.\n\n[[File:Aritomo Yamagata 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince [[Aritomo Yamagata]], twice [[Prime Minister of Japan]].

The Diet consisted of the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] and the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]]. Both houses opened seats for colonial people as well as Japanese.

Borrowing and adapting technology from the West, Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with [[textiles]]. The economic structure became very [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products \u2014 a reflection of Japan's relative scarcity of raw materials.\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the [[yen]], banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. The government was initially involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern period. The transition took time. By the 1890s, however, the Meiji had successfully established a modern institutional framework that would transform Japan into an advanced capitalist economy. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons. Many of the former ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries.\n\n[[File:Thomas Blake Glover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Thomas Blake Glover]] was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[merchant]] in [[Bakumatsu]] and received Japan's second highest [[Order (honour)|order]] from [[Emperor Meiji]] in recognition of his contributions to Japan's industrialization.]]\n\nJapan emerged from the Tokugawa-Meiji transition as the first Asian industrialized nation. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. Rapid growth and structural change characterized Japan's two periods of economic development after 1868. Initially, the economy grew only moderately and relied heavily on traditional Japanese agriculture to finance modern industrial infrastructure. By the time the [[Russo-Japanese War]] began in 1904, 65% of employment and 38% of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) were still based on agriculture, but modern industry had begun to expand substantially. By the late 1920s, manufacturing and mining amounted to 34% of GDP, compared with 20% for all of agriculture.<ref>http://www.ggdc.nl/databases/hna/2009/data/hna_jpn_09.xls</ref> Transportation and communications developed to sustain heavy industrial development.\n\nFrom 1894, Japan built an extensive empire that included [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]], [[Manchuria]], and parts of [[North China|northern China]]. The Japanese regarded this [[sphere of influence]] as a political and economic necessity, which prevented foreign states from strangling Japan by blocking its access to raw materials and crucial sea-lanes. Japan's large military force was regarded as essential to the empire's defense and prosperity by obtaining natural resources that the Japanese islands lacked.\n\n===First Sino-Japanese War===\n{{Main|First Sino-Japanese War|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}\n\nThe [[First Sino-Japanese War]], fought in 1894 and 1895, revolved around the issue of control and influence over Korea under the rule of the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]]. Korea had traditionally been a [[tributary state]] of China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], which exerted large influence over the conservative Korean officials who gathered around the royal family of the [[Joseon]] kingdom. On February 27, 1876, after several confrontations between Korean isolationists and Japanese, Japan imposed the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876]], forcing Korea open to Japanese trade. The act blocks any other power from dominating Korea, resolving to end the centuries-old Chinese [[suzerainty]].\n\nOn June 4, 1894, Korea requested aid from the Qing Empire in suppressing the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution|Donghak Rebellion]]. The Qing government sent 2,800 troops to Korea. The Japanese countered by sending an 8,000-troop expeditionary force (the Oshima Composite Brigade) to Korea. The first 400 troops arrived on June 9 en route to [[Seoul]], and 3,000 landed at [[Incheon]] on June 12.<ref name=\"Seth 2010 225\">{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Michael J|title=A History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6716-0|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Korea.html?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC}}</ref> The Qing government turned down Japan's suggestion for Japan and China to cooperate to reform the Korean government. When Korea demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from Korea, the Japanese refused. In early June 1894, the 8,000 Japanese troops captured the Korean king Gojong, occupied the [[Gyeongbokgung|Royal Palace]] in [[Seoul]] and, by June 25, installed a puppet government in Seoul. The new pro-Japanese Korean government granted Japan the right to expel Qing forces while Japan dispatched more troops to Korea.\n\n[[File:Katsura Taro.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Prince [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], thrice Prime Minister and the [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]].

Japanese ground troops routed the Chinese forces on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], and nearly destroyed the Chinese navy in the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. The [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed between Japan and China, which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of [[Taiwan]] to Japan. After the peace treaty, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[French Third Republic|France]] [[Triple Intervention|forced Japan]] to withdraw from Liaodong Peninsula. Soon afterwards Russia occupied the Liaodong Peninsula, built the [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] fortress, and based the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] in the port. Germany occupied [[Jiaozhou Bay]], built Tsingtao fortress and based the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in this port.\n\n[[File:1895_Meiji_28_Japanese_Map_of_Imperial_Japan_with_Taiwan_-_Geographicus_-_ImperialJapan-meiji28-1895.jpg|thumb|left|An map of the Japanese Empire dating to 1895.

Of the total, 20,300 were Imperial Japanese Army troops of the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Infantry Division]] under Lt.

Prime Minister Yamagata agreed, but others in the cabinet demanded that there be guarantees from the British in return for the risks and costs of the major deployment of Japanese troops.{{sfn|Drea|2009|p=98}} On July 6, 1900, the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Infantry Division]] was alerted for possible deployment to China, but no timetable was set for this. Two days later, with more ground troops urgently needed to lift the siege of the foreign legations at Peking, the British ambassador offered the Japanese government one million British pounds in exchange for Japanese participation.{{sfn|Drea|2009|p=98}}\n\nShortly afterward, advance units of the 5th Division departed for China, bringing Japanese strength to 3,800 personnel out of the 17,000 of allied forces.{{sfn|Drea|2009|p=98}} The commander of the 5th Division, Lt.

The victory greatly raised Japan's stature in the world of global politics. The war is marked by the Japanese opposition of Russian interests in Korea, Manchuria, and China, notably, the Liaodong Peninsula, controlled by the city of [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Ryojun]].\n\nOriginally, in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Ryojun had been given to Japan. This part of the treaty was overruled by Western powers, which gave the port to the Russian Empire, furthering Russian interests in the region. These interests came into conflict with Japanese interests. The war began with a surprise attack on the Russian Eastern fleet stationed at Port Arthur, which was followed by the [[Battle of Port Arthur]]. Those elements that attempted escape were defeated by the Japanese navy under Admiral Togo Heihachiro at the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]]. Following a late start, the Russian Baltic fleet was denied passage through the British-controlled [[Suez Canal]]. The fleet arrived on the scene a year later, only to be annihilated in the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. While the ground war did not fare as poorly for the Russians, the Japanese forces were significantly more aggressive than their Russian counterparts and gained a political advantage that culminated with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], negotiated in the United States by the [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. As a result, Russia lost the part of [[Sakhalin]] Island south of [[50th parallel north|50 degrees North]] latitude (which became [[Karafuto Prefecture]]), as well as many mineral rights in Manchuria. In addition, Russia's defeat cleared the way for Japan to [[Japan\u2013Korea Annexation Treaty|annex Korea outright]] in 1910.\n\n===Annexation of Korea===\n{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various Western countries actively competed for influence, trade, and territory in [[East Asia]], and Japan sought to join these modern colonial powers. The newly modernised [[Meiji government]] of Japan turned to Korea, then in the [[sphere of influence]] of China's [[Qing dynasty]]. The Japanese government initially sought to separate Korea from Qing and make Korea a [[puppet state|Japanese satellite]] in order to further their security and national interests.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duus|first=Peter|title=The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895\u20131910|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0520213616}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1876, following the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan employed [[gunboat diplomacy]] to pressure the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] into signing the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876]], which granted [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]] to Japanese citizens and opened three Korean ports to Japanese trade.

After proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]], Korea was officially [[annexed]] in Japan through the [[Japan\u2013Korea Annexation Treaty|annexation treaty]] in 1910.\n\nIn Korea, the period is usually described as the \"Time of Japanese Forced Occupation\" ([[Hangul]]: {{lang|ko|\uc77c\uc81c \uac15\uc810\uae30}}; ''Ilje gangjeomgi'', [[Hanja]]: \u65e5\u5e1d\u5f3a\u5360\u671f).

Japan declared war on Germany on August 23, 1914. Japanese and allied British Empire forces soon moved to occupy Tsingtao fortress, the [[German East Asia Squadron]] base, German-leased territories in China's [[Shandong|Shandong Province]] as well as the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific, which were part of [[German New Guinea]]. The swift invasion in the German territory of the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] and the [[Siege of Tsingtao]] proved successful. The German colonial troops surrendered on November 7, 1914, and Japan gained the German holdings.\n\n[[File:Jokyoin and Junkei.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Native [[Austronesian]] police officers of [[Truk Island]], circa 1930.

Japan sought further to consolidate its position in China by presenting the [[Twenty-One Demands]] to China in January 1915. In the face of slow negotiations with the Chinese government, widespread [[anti-Japanese sentiment in China]], and international condemnation, Japan withdrew the final group of demands, and treaties were signed in May 1915. The [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] was renewed and expanded in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911, before its demise in 1921.

Prime Minister [[Terauchi Masatake]] agreed to send 12,000 troops but under the Japanese command rather than as part of an international coalition. The Japanese had several hidden motives for the venture, which included an intense hostility and fear of communism; a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia; and the desire to settle the ''\"northern problem\"'' in Japan's security, either through the creation of a buffer state or through outright territorial acquisition.\n\n[[File:Siberia- Civil War and Western Intervention 1918-1920 Q61674.jpg|thumb|left|Commanding Officers and Chiefs of Staff of the Allied Military Mission to [[Siberia]], [[Vladivostok]] during the [[Siberian Intervention|Allied Intervention]]]]\n\nBy November 1918, more than 70,000 [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese troops]] under Chief of Staff Yui Mitsue had occupied all ports and major towns in the [[Primorsky Krai|Russian Maritime Provinces]] and eastern [[Siberia]].

However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of Communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese army provided military support to the Japanese-backed [[Provisional Priamurye Government]] based in Vladivostok against the Moscow-backed [[Far Eastern Republic]].\n\nThe continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and the Russian Far East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and United Kingdom, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister [[Kat\u014d Tomosabur\u014d]] withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922.

The public grew disillusioned with the growing national debt and the new election laws, which retained the old minimum tax qualifications for voters. Calls were raised for universal suffrage and the dismantling of the old political party network. Students, university professors, and journalists, bolstered by labor unions and inspired by a variety of democratic, socialist, communist, anarchist, and other thoughts, mounted large but orderly public demonstrations in favor of universal male suffrage in 1919 and 1920.\n\n[[File:Takaaki Kato.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Count [[Kat\u014d Takaaki|Kat\u014d Komei]], the 14th [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from June 11, 1924, until his death on January 28, 1926]]\n\nThe election of [[Kat\u014d Takaaki|Kat\u014d Komei]] as Prime Minister of Japan continued democratic reforms that had been advocated by influential individuals on the left. This culminated in the passage of universal male suffrage in March 1925. This bill gave all male subjects over the age of 25 the right to vote, provided they had lived in their electoral districts for at least one year and were not homeless. The electorate thereby increased from 3.3 million to 12.5 million.<ref>Hane, Mikiso, ''Modern Japan: A Historical Survey'' (Oxford: Westview Press, 1992) 234.</ref>\n\nIn the political milieu of the day, there was a proliferation of new parties, including socialist and communist parties. Fear of a broader electorate, left-wing power, and the growing social change led to the passage of the [[Peace Preservation Law]] in 1925, which forbade any change in the political structure or the abolition of private property.\n\nUnstable coalitions and divisiveness in the Diet led the [[Kenseikai]] ({{lang|ja|\u61b2\u653f\u4f1a}} ''Constitutional Government Association'') and the Seiy\u016b Hont\u014d ({{lang|ja|\u653f\u53cb\u672c\u515a}} ''True Seiy\u016bkai'') to merge as the [[Constitutional Democratic Party (Japan)|Rikken Minseit\u014d]] ({{lang|ja|\u7acb\u61b2\u6c11\u653f\u515a}} ''Constitutional Democratic Party'') in 1927. The [[Rikken Minseit\u014d]] platform was committed to the parliamentary system, democratic politics, and world peace. Thereafter, until 1932, the [[Rikken Seiy\u016bkai|Seiy\u016bkai]] and the Rikken Minseit\u014d alternated in power.\n\nDespite the political realignments and hope for more orderly government, domestic economic crises plagued whichever party held power. Fiscal austerity programs and appeals for public support of such conservative government policies as the Peace Preservation Law\u2014including reminders of the moral obligation to make sacrifices for the emperor and the state\u2014were attempted as solutions.\n\n==Early Sh\u014dwa (1926\u20131930)==\n{{Main|Sh\u014dwa period}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Sh\u014dwa Army 1938-1-8.jpg|thumb|[[Hirohito|Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] during an Army inspection on January 8, 1938]]\n\n===Expansion of democracy===\nIn 1932, Park Chun-kum was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] in the [[Japanese general election, 1932|Japanese general election]] as the first person elected from a colonial background.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}<ref name=shugiin150>{{cite web|title=\u7b2c150\u56de\u56fd\u4f1a\u3000\u653f\u6cbb\u502b\u7406\u306e\u78ba\u7acb\u53ca\u3073\u516c\u8077\u9078\u6319\u6cd5\u6539\u6b63\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7279\u5225\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a \u7b2c12\u53f7\u3000\u5e73\u621012\u5e7411\u670816\u65e5\uff08\u6728\u66dc\u65e5\uff09|publisher=House of Representatives of Japan|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_kaigiroku.nsf/html/kaigiroku/007115020001116012.htm?OpenDocument|date=November 16, 2000|accessdate=October 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200616/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_kaigiroku.nsf/html/kaigiroku/007115020001116012.htm?OpenDocument|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> In 1935, democracy was introduced in Taiwan and in response to Taiwanese public opinion, local assemblies were established.<ref name=nittaikyo>{{cite web|title=\u6226\u9593\u671f\u53f0\u6e7e\u5730\u65b9\u9078\u6319\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8003\u5bdf|work=\u53e4\u5e02\u5229\u96c4|publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7814\u7a76\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e9\u30e0 \u3010\u53f0\u6e7e\u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u58c7\u3011|url=http://www.nittaikyo-ei.join-us.jp/koichi.html|accessdate=October 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411052847/http://www.nittaikyo-ei.join-us.jp/koichi.html|archivedate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> In 1942, 38 colonial people were elected to local assemblies of the Japanese homeland.<ref name=shugiin150/>\n\nOverall, during the 1920s, Japan changed its direction toward a democratic system of government. However, [[parliamentary government]] was not rooted deeply enough to withstand the economic and political pressures of the 1930s, during which military leaders became increasingly influential. These shifts in power were made possible by the ambiguity and imprecision of the [[Meiji Constitution]], particularly as regarded the position of the Emperor in relation to the constitution.\n\n===Military and social organizations===\n{{See also|Japanese militarism}}\n\n[[File:Tokyokaikan before.jpg|thumb|left|Tokyo Kaikan was requisitioned as the meeting place for members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (''Taisei Yokusankai'') in the early days.]]\n\nImportant institutional links existed between the party in government ([[K\u014dd\u014dha]]) and military and political organizations, such as the [[Imperial Young Federation]] and the \"Political Department\" of the [[Kempeitai]]. Amongst the himitsu kessha (secret societies), the [[Black Dragon Society|Kokuryu-kai]] and Kokka Shakai Shugi Gakumei (National Socialist League) also had close ties to the government. The [[Tonarigumi]] (residents committee) groups, the Nation Service Society (national government trade union), and [[Imperial Farmers Association]] were all allied as well. Other organizations and groups related with the government in wartime were the [[Double Leaf Society]], [[Kokuhonsha]], [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association|Taisei Yokusankai]], [[Imperial Youth Corps]], [[Police services of the Empire of Japan|Keishich\u014d]] (to 1945), [[State Shinto|Shintoist Rites Research Council]], [[Treaty Faction]], [[Fleet Faction]], and [[Volunteer Fighting Corps]].\n\n===Nationalist factors===\n{{Main|Japanese nationalism|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Imperial Way Faction|May 15 Incident|February 26 Incident}}\n{{Further|Imperial Rule Assistance Association}}\n\n[[File:OKAWA Shumei.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Japanese [[Pan-Asian]] writer [[Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa]]]]\n\n[[Sadao Araki]] was an important figurehead and founder of the Army party and the most important right-wing thinker in his time. His first ideological works date from his leadership of the [[K\u014dd\u014dha]] (Imperial Benevolent Rule or Action Group), opposed by the [[T\u014dseiha]] (Control Group) led by General [[Kazushige Ugaki]]. He linked the ancient (''[[bushido]]'' code) and contemporary local and European fascist ideals (see [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan]]), to form the ideological basis of the movement ([[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Sh\u014dwa nationalism]]).\n\nFrom September 1931, the Japanese were becoming more locked into the course that would lead them into the Second World War, with Araki leading the way. [[Totalitarianism]], [[militarism]], and [[expansionism]] were to become the rule, with fewer voices able to speak against it. In a September 23 news conference, Araki first mentioned the philosophy of \"K\u014dd\u014dha\" (The [[Imperial Way Faction]]). The concept of Kodo linked the Emperor, the people, land, and morality as indivisible. This led to the creation of a \"new\" [[Shinto]] and increased [[Emperor worship]].\n\n[[File:226 Police HQ Rebels.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rebel troops assembling at police headquarters during the [[February 26 Incident]]]]\n\nOn February 26, 1936, a coup d'\u00e9tat was attempted (the [[February 26 Incident]]). Launched by the ultranationalist K\u014dd\u014dha faction with the military, it ultimately failed due to the intervention of the Emperor. K\u014dd\u014dha members were purged from the top military positions and the [[T\u014dseiha]] faction gained dominance. However, both factions believed in expansionism, a strong military, and a coming war. Furthermore, K\u014dd\u014dha members, while removed from the military, still had political influence within the government.\n\nThe state was being transformed to serve the Army and the Emperor. Symbolic [[katana]] swords came back into fashion as the martial embodiment of these beliefs, and the [[Nambu pistol]] became its contemporary equivalent, with the implicit message that the Army doctrine of close combat would prevail. The final objective, as envisioned by Army thinkers such as [[Sadao Araki]] and right-wing line followers, was a return to the old [[Shogunate]] system, but in the form of a contemporary Military Shogunate. In such a government the Emperor would once more be a figurehead (as in the [[Edo period]]). Real power would fall to a leader very similar to a f\u00fchrer or duce, though with the power less nakedly held. On the other hand, the traditionalist Navy militarists defended the Emperor and a constitutional monarchy with a significant religious aspect.\n\nA third point of view was supported by [[Prince Chichibu]], a brother of [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]], who repeatedly counseled him to implement a ''direct imperial rule'', even if that meant suspending the constitution.<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 284</ref>\n\nWith the launching of the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] in 1940 by Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]], Japan would turn to a form of government that resembled [[totalitarianism]]. This unique style of government, very similar to [[fascism]], was known as [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan]].\n\nIn the early twentieth century, a distinctive style of architecture was developed for the empire. Now referred to as [[Imperial Crown Style]] (\u5e1d\u51a0\u69d8\u5f0f, ''teikan y\u014dshiki''), before the end of World War II, it was originally referred to as ''Emperor's Crown Amalgamate Style'', and sometimes ''Emperor's Crown Style'' (\u5e1d\u51a0\u5f0f, Teikanshiki). The style is identified by Japanese-style roofing on top of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styled buildings; and can have a centrally elevated structure with a pyramidal dome. The prototype for this style was developed by architect [[Shimoda Kikutaro]] in his proposal for the Imperial Diet Building (present National Diet Building) in 1920 \u2013 although his proposal was ultimately rejected. Outside of the Japanese mainland, in places like [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]], Imperial Crown Style architecture often included regional architectural elements.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Chia-Hui Lin|title=Heteroglossic Asia: The Transformation of Urban Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYIcBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT85|date=9 January 2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-62637-4|pages=85\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Economic factors===\n[[File:Bank run during the Showa Financial Crisis.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|A bank run during the [[Sh\u014dwa financial crisis]], March 1927]]\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' trading groups (principally [[Mitsubishi]], [[Mitsui]], [[Sumitomo]], and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|Yasuda]]) looked towards great future expansion. Their main concern was a shortage of raw materials. Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]] combined social concerns with the needs of capital, and planned for expansion.\n\nThe main goals of Japan's expansionism were acquisition and protection of spheres of influence, maintenance of territorial integrity, acquisition of raw materials, and access to Asian markets. Western nations, notably Great Britain, France, and the United States, had for long exhibited great interest in the commercial opportunities in China and other parts of Asia. These opportunities had attracted Western investment because of the availability of raw materials for both domestic production and re-export to Asia. Japan desired these opportunities in planning the development of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].\n\nThe [[Great Depression]], just as in many other countries, hindered Japan's economic growth. The Japanese Empire's main problem lay in that rapid industrial expansion had turned the country into a major manufacturing and industrial power that required raw materials; however, these had to be obtained from overseas, as there was a critical lack of natural resources on the home islands.\n\n[[File:National Diet in 1930s.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Diet Building]], 1930]]\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Japan needed to import raw materials such as iron, rubber, and oil to maintain strong economic growth. Most of these resources came from the United States. The Japanese felt that acquiring resource-rich territories would establish economic self-sufficiency and independence, and they also hoped to jump-start the nation's economy in the midst of the depression. As a result, Japan set its sights on [[East Asia]], specifically [[Manchuria]] with its many resources; Japan needed these resources to continue its economic development and maintain national integrity.\n\n==Later Sh\u014dwa (1931\u20131941) \u2013 expansionism and war==\n{{Main|Hakk\u014d ichiu|National Spiritual Mobilization Movement|World War II}}\n\n===Prewar expansionism===\n{{Main|Japanese nationalism|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n\n====Manchuria====\n{{Main|Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Pacification of Manchukuo}}\n\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]], [[Northeast China]] during the [[Mukden Incident]], 1931]]\n\nIn 1931, Japan invaded and conquered Northeast China ([[Manchuria]]) with little resistance. Japan claimed that this invasion was a liberation of the local [[Manchu]]s from the Chinese, although the majority of the population were [[Han Chinese]] as a result of the [[Chuang Guandong|large scale settlement of Chinese in Manchuria]] in the 19th century. Japan then established a [[puppet regime]] called [[Manchukuo]] ({{zh|t=\u6eff\u6d32\u570b}}), and installed the last [[List of emperors of the Qing dynasty|Manchu Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as the official [[head of state]]. [[Jehol Province|Jehol]], a Chinese territory bordering Manchukuo, was later also taken in 1933. This puppet regime had to carry on a protracted pacification campaign against the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] in Manchuria. In 1936, Japan created a similar Mongolian puppet state in Inner Mongolia named [[Mengjiang]] ({{zh|t=\u8499\u7586}}), which was also predominantly Chinese as a result of recent Han immigration to the area. At that time, East Asians were banned from immigration to [[Immigration Act of 1924|North America]] and [[White Australia policy|Australia]], but the newly established Manchukuo was open to immigration of Asians. Japan had an emigration plan to encourage colonization; the Japanese population in Manchuria subsequently grew to 850,000.<ref>Kevin McDowell.

On December 13 of that same year, the Nationalist capital of [[Nanjing]] [[Battle of Nanjing|surrendered to Japanese troops]]. In the event known as the \"[[Nanjing Massacre]]\", Japanese troops massacred a large number of the defending garrison. It is estimated that as many as 200,000 to 300,000 including civilians, may have been killed, although the actual numbers are uncertain and possibly inflated coupled with the fact that the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has never undertaken a full accounting of the massacre. In total, an estimated 20 million Chinese, mostly civilians, were killed during World War II. [[Wang Jingwei regime|A puppet state]] was also set up in China quickly afterwards, headed by [[Wang Jingwei]]. The Second Sino-Japanese War continued into World War II with the Communists and Nationalists in [[Second United Front|a temporary and uneasy nominal alliance]] against the Japanese.\n\n====Clashes with the Soviet Union====\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Khasan|Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact}}\n\nIn 1938, the Japanese 19th Division entered territory claimed by the Soviet Union, leading to the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]]. This incursion was founded in the Japanese belief that the Soviet Union misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary, as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Peking]], between Imperial Russia and Manchu China (and subsequent supplementary agreements on demarcation), and furthermore, that the demarcation markers were tampered with.\n\nOn May 11, 1939, in the Nomonhan Incident ''([[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]])'', a Mongolian cavalry unit of some 70 to 90 men entered the disputed area in search of grazing for their horses, and encountered Manchukuoan cavalry, who drove them out. Two days later the Mongolian force returned and the Manchukoans were unable to evict them.\n\nThe [[IJA 23rd Division]] and other units of the [[Kwantung Army]] then became involved. [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered [[Stavka]], the [[Red Army]]'s high command, to develop a plan for a counterstrike against the Japanese. In late August, [[Georgy Zhukov]] employed encircling tactics that made skillful use of superior artillery, armor, and air forces; this offensive nearly annihilated the 23rd Division and decimated the [[IJA 7th Division]]. On September 15 an armistice was arranged. Nearly two years later, on April 13, 1941, the parties signed a [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]], in which the Soviet Union pledged to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of Manchukuo, while Japan agreed similarly for the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].\n\n===Tripartite Pact===\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact|Axis powers}}\n\n[[File:Signing ceremony for the Axis Powers Tripartite Pact;.jpg|thumb|Signing ceremony for the Axis Powers Tripartite Pact]]\n\nIn 1938, Japan prohibited the expulsion of the [[Jews]] in Japan, [[Manchuria]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] in accordance with the spirit of [[racial equality]] on which Japan had insisted for many years.<ref name=mof>{{cite web|title=Question \u6226\u524d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5bfe\u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u306a\u3057\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4eba\u5bfe\u7b56\u8981\u7db1\u300d\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u53f2\u6599\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u540c\u8981\u7db1\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8aac\u660e\u6587\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/shiryo/qa/senzen_03.html|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}</ref><ref name=gosho>{{cite web|title=\u7336\u592a\u4eba\u5bfe\u7b56\u8981\u7db1|work=Five Ministers Council|publisher=[[National Archives of Japan|Japan Center for Asian Historical Record]]|url=http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&ID=M2006092115064531921|page=36/42|date=December 6, 1938|accessdate=October 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042931/http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&ID=M2006092115064531921|archivedate=July 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanjing Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940\u201341, and with the continuing war in China, the United States and its allies placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[Southeast Asia]]\u2014specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]).\n\nOn September 27, 1940, Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Germany and Italy. Their objectives were to \"establish and maintain a new order of things\" in their respective world regions and spheres of influence, with Germany and Italy in Europe, and Japan in Asia. The signatories of this [[Military alliance|alliance]] became known as the [[Axis Powers]]. The pact also called for mutual protection\u2014if any one of the member powers was attacked by a country not already at war, excluding the [[Soviet Union]]\u2014and for technological and economic cooperation between the signatories.\n\n[[File:Founding Ceremony of the Hakko-Ichiu Monument.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Founding ceremony of the '''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''' (''All the world under one roof'') monument in 1940]]\n\nFor the sake of their own people and nation, Prime Minister Konoe formed the Taisei Yokusankai ([[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]]) on October 12, 1940, as a ruling party in Japan.\n\n==Pacific War (1941\u20131945) (World War II)==\n{{Main|Japan during World War II|Pacific War}}\n\n[[File:Second world war asia 1937-1942 map en6.png|thumb|upright=1.2|A map of the Japanese advance from 1937 to 1942]]\n\nFacing an oil embargo by the United States as well as dwindling domestic reserves, the Japanese government decided to execute a plan developed by [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to attack the United States Pacific Fleet in Hawaii. While the United States was [[neutral country|neutral]] and continued negotiating with Japan for possible peace in Asia, the Imperial Japanese Navy at the same time made its surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Honolulu]] on December 7, 1941. As a result, the U.S. battleship fleet was decimated and almost 2,500 people died in the attack that day. The primary objective of the attack was to incapacitate the United States long enough for Japan to establish its long-planned South East Asian empire and defensible buffer zones. The American public saw the attack as barbaric and treacherous and rallied against the Japanese. Four days later, [[Adolf Hitler]] of Germany, and [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy declared war on the United States, merging the separate conflicts. The United States entered the [[European Theatre]] and [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in full force, thereby bringing the United States to World War II on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\n===Japanese conquests===\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese launched offensives against Allied forces in East and Southeast Asia, with simultaneous attacks in [[History of colonial Hong Kong|British Hong Kong]], [[British Malaya]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]]. [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong surrendered]] to the Japanese on December 25. In [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] the Japanese overwhelmed an Allied army composed of British, Indian, [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] forces. The Japanese were quickly able to advance down the [[Malayan Peninsula]], forcing the Allied forces to retreat towards [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. The Allies lacked aircover and tanks; the Japanese had complete air superiority. The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of HMS ''Prince of Wales'' and HMS ''Repulse'']] on December 10, 1941, led to the east coast of Malaya being exposed to Japanese landings and the elimination of British naval power in the area. By the end of January 1942, the last Allied forces crossed the strait of Johore and into Singapore.\n\n[[File:JapaneseMarchSgpCity.jpg|thumb|Victorious Japanese troops march through the city center of [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] following the [[Battle of Singapore|city's capture]] in February 1942 (Photo from the [[Imperial War Museum]])]]\n\nIn [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|the Philippines]], the Japanese pushed the combined American-Filipino force towards [[Battle of Bataan|the Bataan Peninsula]] and later the [[Battle of Corregidor|island of Corregidor]].

This marked one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans, leaving over 70,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war in the custody of the Japanese. On February 15, 1942, [[Straits Settlements|Singapore]], due to the overwhelming superiority of Japanese forces and encirclement tactics, [[Battle of Singapore|fell to the Japanese]], causing the largest [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] of British-led military personnel in history. An estimated 80,000 Australian, British and Indian troops were taken as [[prisoners of war]], joining 50,000 taken in the [[Battle of Malaya|Japanese invasion of Malaya]] (modern day [[Malaysia]]).

This, coupled with the losses inflicted by [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|Allied submarines]] on Japanese shipping routes, began to strangle Japan's economy and undermine its ability to supply its army. By early 1945, the US Marines had wrested control of the [[Ogasawara Islands]] in several hard-fought battles such as the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], marking the beginning of the fall of the islands of Japan. After securing airfields in [[Saipan]] and [[Guam]] in the summer of 1944, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] conducted an intense [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] by having [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers in nighttime low altitude incendiary raids, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's war industry and [[demoralization (warfare)|shatter its morale]]. The [[Operation Meetinghouse]] raid on Tokyo on the night of March 9\u201310, 1945, led to the deaths of approximately 120,000 civilians. Approximately 350,000\u2013500,000 civilians died in 67 Japanese cities as a result of the [[Firebombing|incendiary bombing]] campaign on Japan. Concurrent with these attacks, Japan's vital coastal shipping operations were severely hampered with extensive aerial mining by the US's [[Operation Starvation]]. Regardless, these efforts did not succeed in persuading the Japanese military to surrender. In mid-August 1945, the United States dropped [[nuclear weapon]]s on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. These bombings were the first and only combat use of nuclear weaponry. These two bombs killed approximately 120,000 people in a matter of minutes, and as many as a result of [[nuclear radiation]] in the following weeks, months and years. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945.\n\nAt the [[Yalta agreement]], the US, the UK, and the USSR had agreed that the USSR would enter the war on Japan within three months of the defeat of Germany in Europe. This [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War]] led to the fall of Japan's Manchurian occupation, Soviet occupation of [[South Sakhalin]] island, and a real, imminent threat of Soviet invasion of the home islands of Japan.

With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war's wake, erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice. Politically, economically, and socially Japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust. ... I sent all four of our occupation divisions to the Korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon Japan. The results fully justified my faith. I know of no nation more serene, orderly, and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race.</blockquote>\n\nFor historian [[John W. Dower]]:\n<blockquote>In retrospect, apart from the military officer corps, the purge of alleged militarists and ultranationalists that was conducted under the Occupation had relatively small impact on the long-term composition of men of influence in the public and private sectors. The purge initially brought new blood into the political parties, but this was offset by the return of huge numbers of formerly purged conservative politicians to national as well as local politics in the early 1950s. In the bureaucracy, the purge was negligible from the outset. ... In the economic sector, the purge similarly was only mildly disruptive, affecting less than sixteen hundred individuals spread among some four hundred companies. Everywhere one looks, the corridors of power in postwar Japan are crowded with men whose talents had already been recognized during the war years, and who found the same talents highly prized in the 'new' Japan.<ref>J.

However, after many Allied victories and following the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan]] on August 9, 1945, and subsequent [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] and other territories, and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the Empire surrendered to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on August 15, 1945. A [[Occupation of Japan|period of occupation]] by the Allies followed. In 1947, with American involvement, a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] was enacted, officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end. Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952, eventually forming the [[Post-occupation Japan|current]] constitutional monarchy known as [[Japan]].\n\nThe [[Emperor of Japan|Emperors]] during this time, which spanned the entire [[Meiji (era)|Meiji]], [[Taish\u014d]], and the lesser part of the [[Sh\u014dwa (1926\u20131989)|Sh\u014dwa]] era, are now known in Japan by their [[posthumous name]]s, which coincide with those era names: [[Emperor Meiji]] (Mutsuhito), [[Emperor Taish\u014d]] (Yoshihito), and [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] (Hirohito).\n\n==Terminology==\nThe historical state is frequently referred to as the \"Empire of Japan\", the \"Japanese Empire\", or \"Imperial Japan\" in English. In Japanese it is referred to as {{Nihongo|''Dai Nippon Teikoku''|\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u56fd}},<ref name=\"Shillony\" /> which translates to \"Empire of Great Japan\" ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5927#Japanese|Dai]]}} \"Great\", {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u65e5\u672c#Japanese|Nippon]]}} \"Japanese\", {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5e1d\u56fd#Japanese|Teikoku]]}} \"Empire\"). ''Teikoku'' is itself composed of the nouns {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u5e1d#Japanese|Tei]]}} \"referring to an emperor\" and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[wikt:\u56fd#Japanese|-koku]]}} \"nation, state\", so literally \"Imperial State\" or \"Imperial Realm\" (compare the [[German language|German]] ''[[German Empire|Kaiserreich]]'').\n\nThis meaning is significant in terms of geography, encompassing Japan and its surrounding areas. The nomenclature ''Empire of Japan'' had existed since the anti-Tokugawa domains, [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], which founded their new government during the [[Meiji Restoration]], with the intention of forming a modern state to resist Western domination.\n\nDue to its name in ''[[kanji]]'' characters and its flag, it was also given the [[exonym]] \"Empire of the Sun\".\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nAfter two centuries, the seclusion policy, or ''[[sakoku]]'', under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'' of the [[Edo period]] came to an end when the country was forced open to trade by the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854. Thus, the period known as [[Bakumatsu]] began.\n\nThe following years saw increased foreign trade and interaction; commercial treaties between the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and Western countries were signed. In large part due to the humiliating terms of these [[unequal treaties]], the shogunate soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical, [[xenophobic]] movement, the ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (literally \"Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\").<ref>Hagiwara, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn March 1863, the Emperor issued the \"[[order to expel barbarians]]\". Although the shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, it nevertheless inspired attacks against the shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan. The [[Namamugi Incident]] during 1862 led to the murder of an Englishman, [[Charles Lennox Richardson]], by a party of [[samurai]] from [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]]. The British demanded reparations but were denied. While attempting to exact payment, the Royal Navy was fired on from coastal batteries near the town of [[Kagoshima]]. They responded by [[Bombardment of Kagoshima|bombarding the port of Kagoshima]] in 1863. The Tokugawa government agreed to pay an indemnity for Richardson's death.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|pp=314\u2013315}} Shelling of foreign shipping in Shimonoseki and attacks against foreign property led to the [[bombardment of Shimonoseki]] by a multinational force in 1864.<ref>Hagiwara, p. 35.</ref> The Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan also launched the failed coup known as the [[Kinmon incident]]. The [[Satch\u014d Alliance|Satsuma-Ch\u014dsh\u016b alliance]] was established in 1866 to combine their efforts to overthrow the Tokugawa bakufu. In early 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died of smallpox and was replaced by his son, Crown Prince Mutsuhito (Meiji).\n\nOn November 9, 1867, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] resigned from his post and authorities to the [[Emperor Meiji|Emperor]], agreeing to \"be the instrument for carrying out\" imperial orders.<ref>Satow, p. 282.</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate had ended.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=116}}{{sfn|Jansen|2002|pp=310\u2013311}} However, while Yoshinobu's resignation had created a nominal void at the highest level of government, his apparatus of state continued to exist. Moreover, the shogunal government, the Tokugawa family in particular, remained a prominent force in the evolving political order and retained many executive powers,<ref>Keene, pp. 120\u2013121, and Satow, p. 283. Moreover, Satow (p. 285) speculates that Yoshinobu had agreed to an assembly of ''daimy\u014ds'' in the hope that such a body would reinstate him.</ref> a prospect hard-liners from Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b found intolerable.<ref>Satow, p. 286.</ref>\n\nOn January 3, 1868, Satsuma-Ch\u014dsh\u016b forces seized the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|imperial palace]] in [[Kyoto]], and the following day had the fifteen-year-old [[Emperor Meiji]] declare his own restoration to full power. Although the majority of the imperial consultative assembly was happy with the formal declaration of direct rule by the court and tended to support a continued collaboration with the Tokugawa, Saig\u014d Takamori threatened the assembly into abolishing the title ''sh\u014dgun'' and ordered the confiscation of Yoshinobu's lands.<ref>During a recess, Saig\u014d, who had his troops outside, \"remarked that it would take only one short sword to settle the discussion\" (Keene, p. 122). Original quotation (Japanese): \"\u77ed\u5200\u4e00\u672c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u304b\u305f\u3065\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3060.\" in Hagiwara, p. 42. The word used for \"dagger\" was ''tant\u014d''.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu declared \"that he would not be bound by the proclamation of the Restoration and called on the court to rescind it\".<!-- Why is this quoted? -->{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=124}} On January 24, Yoshinobu decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arson attacks in Edo, starting with the burning of the outworks of [[Edo Castle]], the main Tokugawa residence.\n\n===Boshin War===\n{{Main|Boshin War}}\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Hakodate.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Naval Battle of Hakodate]], May 1869; in the foreground, {{ship|Japanese warship|Kasuga||2}} and {{ship|Japanese ironclad|K\u014dtetsu||2}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy]]\n\nThe {{nihongo|Boshin War|\u620a\u8fb0\u6226\u4e89|Boshin Sens\u014d}} was fought between January 1868 and May 1869. The alliance of samurai from southern and western domains and court officials had now secured the cooperation of the young Emperor Meiji, who ordered the dissolution of the two-hundred-year-old Tokugawa shogunate. Tokugawa Yoshinobu launched a military campaign to seize the emperor's court at Kyoto. However, the tide rapidly turned in favor of the smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction and resulted in defections of many ''daimy\u014ds'' to the Imperial side. The [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] was a decisive victory in which a combined army from Ch\u014dsh\u016b, Tosa, and Satsuma domains defeated the Tokugawa army.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|p=312}} A series of battles were then fought in pursuit of supporters of the Shogunate; Edo surrendered to the Imperial forces and afterwards Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Yoshinobu was stripped of all his power by Emperor Meiji and most of Japan accepted the emperor's rule.\n\nPro-Tokugawa remnants, however, then retreated to northern Honsh\u016b ([[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]) and later to Ezo (present-day [[Hokkaid\u014d]]), where they established the breakaway [[Republic of Ezo]]. An expeditionary force was dispatched by the new government and the Ezo Republic forces were overwhelmed. The [[Battle of Hakodate|siege of Hakodate]] came to an end in May 1869 and the remaining forces surrendered.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|p=312}}\n\n==Meiji era (1868\u20131912)==\n{{Main|Meiji period|Meiji Restoration|Government of Meiji Japan}}\n\nThe [[Charter Oath]] was made public at the enthronement of Emperor Meiji of Japan on April 7, 1868.

The mission traveled the world in order to renegotiate the [[unequal treaties]] with the United States and European countries that Japan had been forced into during the Tokugawa shogunate, and to gather information on western social and economic systems, in order to effect the modernization of Japan. Renegotiation of the unequal treaties was universally unsuccessful, but close observation of the American and European systems inspired members on their return to bring about modernization initiatives in Japan. Japan made a [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|territorial delimitation treaty]] with Russia in 1875, gaining all the [[Kuril islands]] in exchange for [[Sakhalin island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.go.jp/ayumi/kobetsu/m08_1875_02.html|title=\u660e\u6cbb8\u5e74\uff081875\uff094\u6708\uff5c\u6f38\u6b21\u7acb\u61b2\u653f\u4f53\u6a39\u7acb\u306e\u8a54\u304c\u767a\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5143\u8001\u9662\u30fb\u5927\u5be9\u9662\u304c\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u3042\u3086\u307f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSeveral prominent writers, under the constant threat of assassination from their political foes, were influential in winning Japanese support for [[westernization]]. One such writer was [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]], whose works included \"Conditions in the West,\" \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", and \"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization,\" which detailed Western society and his own philosophies. In the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, military and economic power was emphasized. Military strength became the means for national development and stability. Imperial Japan became the only non-Western [[world power]] and a major force in [[East Asia]] in about 25 years as a result of industrialization and economic development.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Emperor Meiji]], the 122nd emperor of Japan|alt=]]\n\nAs writer [[Albrecht von Urach|Albrecht F\u00fcrst von Urach]] comments in his booklet \"The Secret of Japan's Strength,\" published in 1942, during the [[Axis powers]] period:\n<blockquote>The rise of Japan to a world power during the past 80 years is the greatest miracle in world history. The mighty empires of antiquity, the major political institutions of the Middle Ages and the early modern era, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire, all needed centuries to achieve their full strength. Japan's rise has been meteoric. After only 80 years, it is one of the few great powers that determine the fate of the world.<ref>[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/japan.htm The Secret of Japan's Strength] www.calvin.edu</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe sudden westernization, once it was adopted, changed almost all areas of Japanese society, ranging from armaments, arts, education, etiquette, fashion, health, justice, politics, language, etc. The Japanese government sent students to Western countries to observe and learn their practices, and also paid \"[[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|foreign advisors]]\" in a variety of fields to come to Japan to educate the populace. For instance, the judicial system and constitution were largely modeled on those of Prussia. The government also outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past, such as publicly displaying and wearing [[katana]] and the [[Chonmage|top knot]], both of which were characteristic of the [[samurai]] class, which was abolished together with the caste system. This would later bring the Meiji government into [[Satsuma Rebellion|conflict with the samurai]].\n\n===Transposition in social order===\n{{Main|Japanese new religions#Before World War II|Christianity in Japan#Opening of Japan|History of the Catholic Church in Japan#Rediscovery and return}}\n{{seealso|Turanism}}\n\nIn the 1860s, Japan began to experience great social turmoil and rapid modernization. As social conflicts emerged in this last decade of the [[Edo period]], some new religious movements appeared, which were directly influenced by [[shamanism]] and [[Shinto]].\n\nThe social tension continued to grow during the [[Meiji period]], affecting religious practices and institutions. Conversion from traditional faith was no longer legally forbidden, officials lifted the 250-year ban on Christianity, and missionaries of established Christian churches reentered Japan. The traditional [[syncreticism]] between Shinto and [[Buddhism]] ended. Losing the protection of the Japanese government which Buddhism had enjoyed for centuries, Buddhist monks faced radical difficulties in sustaining their institutions, but their activities also became less restrained by governmental policies and restrictions.\n\n[[File:\u00c9glise des Vingt-Six-Martyrs de Nagazaki.JPG|thumb|left|[[Basilica of the Twenty-Six Holy Martyrs of Japan (Nagasaki)|\u014cura Church]], [[Nagasaki]], 1885]]\n\nEmperor Ogimachi issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568, but to little effect. Beginning in 1587 with imperial regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ban on Jesuit missionaries, Christianity was repressed as a threat to national unity. Under Hideyoshi and the succeeding [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Catholic Christianity was repressed and adherents were persecuted. After the Tokugawa shogunate banned Christianity in 1620, it ceased to exist publicly. Many Catholics went underground, becoming {{nihongo|hidden Christians|\u96a0\u308c\u30ad\u30ea\u30b7\u30bf\u30f3|kakure kirishitan}}, while others lost their lives. After Japan was opened to foreign powers in 1853, many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches, though proselytism was still banned. Only after the Meiji Restoration, was Christianity re-established in Japan. Freedom of religion was introduced in 1871, giving all Christian communities the right to legal existence and preaching.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was brought to Japan in the 19th century by St. Nicholas (baptized as Ivan Dmitrievich Kasatkin),<ref name=\"snow\">''Equal-to-the-Apostles St. Nicholas of Japan, Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist web-site, Washington D.C.''</ref> who was sent in 1861 by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to [[Hakodate]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] as priest to a chapel of the Russian Consulate.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.orthodoxjapan.jp/daishukyou.html |title = \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6b63\u6559\u4f1a\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3 \"History of Japanese Orthodox Charch and Now\" |accessdate = 2007-08-25 |date = 2007-02-01 |publisher = The Orthodox Church in Japan |language = Japanese}}</ref> St. Nicholas of Japan made his own translation of the [[New Testament]] and some other religious books ([[Triodion|Lenten Triodion]], [[Pentecostarion]], [[Liturgy|Feast Services]], [[Book of Psalms]], [[Irmologion]]) into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>''Orthodox translation of Gospel into Japanese, Pravostok Orthodox Portal, October 2006''</ref> Nicholas has since been canonized as a saint by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] in 1970, and is now recognized as St. Nicholas, [[Equal-to-the-Apostles]] to Japan.

His gospel [[Tract (literature)|tract]] translated into Japanese was among the first Protestant literature in Japan. In 1865, McCartee moved back to [[Ningbo]], China, but others have followed in his footsteps. There was a burst of growth of Christianity in the late 19th century when Japan re-opened its doors to the West. Protestant church growth slowed dramatically in the early 20th century under the influence of the military government during the [[Sh\u014dwa period]].\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the government was suspicious towards a number of unauthorized religious movements and periodically made attempts to suppress them. Government suppression was especially severe from the 1930s until the early 1940s, when the growth of [[Japanese nationalism]] and [[State Shinto]] were closely linked. Under the Meiji regime ''[[l\u00e8se majest\u00e9]]'' prohibited insults against the Emperor and his Imperial House, and also against some major Shinto shrines which were believed to be tied strongly to the Emperor. The government strengthened its control over religious institutions that were considered to undermine State Shinto or nationalism.\n\n===Political reform===\n{{Main|Meiji Constitution}}\n{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Interior of the Japanese Parliament, showing the Prime Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House, 1915]]\n\nThe idea of a written constitution had been a subject of heated debate within and outside of the government since the beginnings of the [[Meiji government]]. The conservative [[Meiji oligarchy]] viewed anything resembling [[democracy]] or [[republicanism]] with suspicion and trepidation, and favored a gradualist approach. The [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] demanded the immediate establishment of an elected [[national assembly]], and the promulgation of a constitution.\n\n[[File:Aritomo Yamagata 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince [[Aritomo Yamagata]], twice [[Prime Minister of Japan]].

The Diet consisted of the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] and the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]]. Both houses opened seats for colonial people as well as Japanese. The Imperial Diet continued until 1947.<ref name=ndlconstitution/>\n\n===Economic development===\n{{Main|Economy of the Empire of Japan|Economic history of Japan#20th century}}\n\n[[File:Tokyo Industrial Exhibition.JPG|thumb|left|Tokyo Industrial Exhibition, 1907]]\n[[File:Views of Yamagata City by Takahashi Yuichi.jpg|thumb|left|View of the city of [[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]], c. 1881]]\n[[File:Jingusatsu 1881.jpg|thumb|left|A 1-yen banknote, 1881]]\n\nThe process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government in close connection with a powerful clique of companies known as ''[[zaibatsu]]'' (e.g.: [[Mitsui]] and [[Mitsubishi]]). Borrowing and adapting technology from the West, Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with [[textiles]]. The economic structure became very [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products \u2014 a reflection of Japan's relative scarcity of raw materials.\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the [[yen]], banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. The government was initially involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern period. The transition took time. By the 1890s, however, the Meiji had successfully established a modern institutional framework that would transform Japan into an advanced capitalist economy. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons. Many of the former ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries.\n\n[[File:Thomas Blake Glover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Thomas Blake Glover]] was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[merchant]] in [[Bakumatsu]] and received Japan's second highest [[Order (honour)|order]] from [[Emperor Meiji]] in recognition of his contributions to Japan's industrialization.]]\n\nJapan emerged from the Tokugawa-Meiji transition as the first Asian industrialized nation. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. Rapid growth and structural change characterized Japan's two periods of economic development after 1868. Initially, the economy grew only moderately and relied heavily on traditional Japanese agriculture to finance modern industrial infrastructure. By the time the [[Russo-Japanese War]] began in 1904, 65% of employment and 38% of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) were still based on agriculture, but modern industry had begun to expand substantially. By the late 1920s, manufacturing and mining amounted to 34% of GDP, compared with 20% for all of agriculture.<ref>http://www.ggdc.nl/databases/hna/2009/data/hna_jpn_09.xls</ref> Transportation and communications developed to sustain heavy industrial development.\n\nFrom 1894, Japan built an extensive empire that included [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]], [[Manchuria]], and parts of [[North China|northern China]]. The Japanese regarded this [[sphere of influence]] as a political and economic necessity, which prevented foreign states from strangling Japan by blocking its access to raw materials and crucial sea-lanes. Japan's large military force was regarded as essential to the empire's defense and prosperity by obtaining natural resources that the Japanese islands lacked.\n\n===First Sino-Japanese War===\n{{Main|First Sino-Japanese War|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}\n\nThe [[First Sino-Japanese War]], fought in 1894 and 1895, revolved around the issue of control and influence over Korea under the rule of the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]]. Korea had traditionally been a [[tributary state]] of China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], which exerted large influence over the conservative Korean officials who gathered around the royal family of the [[Joseon]] kingdom. On February 27, 1876, after several confrontations between Korean isolationists and Japanese, Japan imposed the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876]], forcing Korea open to Japanese trade. The act blocks any other power from dominating Korea, resolving to end the centuries-old Chinese [[suzerainty]].\n\nOn June 4, 1894, Korea requested aid from the Qing Empire in suppressing the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution|Donghak Rebellion]]. The Qing government sent 2,800 troops to Korea. The Japanese countered by sending an 8,000-troop expeditionary force (the Oshima Composite Brigade) to Korea. The first 400 troops arrived on June 9 en route to [[Seoul]], and 3,000 landed at [[Incheon]] on June 12.<ref name=\"Seth 2010 225\">{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Michael J|title=A History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6716-0|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Korea.html?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC}}</ref> The Qing government turned down Japan's suggestion for Japan and China to cooperate to reform the Korean government. When Korea demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from Korea, the Japanese refused. In early June 1894, the 8,000 Japanese troops captured the Korean king Gojong, occupied the [[Gyeongbokgung|Royal Palace]] in [[Seoul]] and, by June 25, installed a puppet government in Seoul. The new pro-Japanese Korean government granted Japan the right to expel Qing forces while Japan dispatched more troops to Korea.\n\n[[File:Katsura Taro.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Prince [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], thrice Prime Minister and the [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]].

Japanese ground troops routed the Chinese forces on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], and nearly destroyed the Chinese navy in the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. The [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed between Japan and China, which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of [[Taiwan]] to Japan. After the peace treaty, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[French Third Republic|France]] [[Triple Intervention|forced Japan]] to withdraw from Liaodong Peninsula. Soon afterwards Russia occupied the Liaodong Peninsula, built the [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] fortress, and based the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] in the port. Germany occupied [[Jiaozhou Bay]], built Tsingtao fortress and based the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in this port.\n\n[[File:1895_Meiji_28_Japanese_Map_of_Imperial_Japan_with_Taiwan_-_Geographicus_-_ImperialJapan-meiji28-1895.jpg|thumb|left|An map of the Japanese Empire dating to 1895.

Of the total, 20,300 were Imperial Japanese Army troops of the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Infantry Division]] under Lt.

The victory greatly raised Japan's stature in the world of global politics. The war is marked by the Japanese opposition of Russian interests in Korea, Manchuria, and China, notably, the Liaodong Peninsula, controlled by the city of [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Ryojun]].\n\nOriginally, in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Ryojun had been given to Japan. This part of the treaty was overruled by Western powers, which gave the port to the Russian Empire, furthering Russian interests in the region. These interests came into conflict with Japanese interests. The war began with a surprise attack on the Russian Eastern fleet stationed at Port Arthur, which was followed by the [[Battle of Port Arthur]]. Those elements that attempted escape were defeated by the Japanese navy under Admiral Togo Heihachiro at the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]]. Following a late start, the Russian Baltic fleet was denied passage through the British-controlled [[Suez Canal]]. The fleet arrived on the scene a year later, only to be annihilated in the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. While the ground war did not fare as poorly for the Russians, the Japanese forces were significantly more aggressive than their Russian counterparts and gained a political advantage that culminated with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], negotiated in the United States by the [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. As a result, Russia lost the part of [[Sakhalin]] Island south of [[50th parallel north|50 degrees North]] latitude (which became [[Karafuto Prefecture]]), as well as many mineral rights in Manchuria.

In Japan, a more common description is {{nihongo|\"The Korea of Japanese rule\"|\u65e5\u672c\u7d71\u6cbb\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u671d\u9bae|Nippon T\u014dchi-jidai no Ch\u014dsen}}. The [[Korean Peninsula]] was officially part of the Empire of Japan for 35 years, from August 29, 1910, until the formal Japanese rule ended, ''[[de jure]]'', on September 2, 1945, upon the [[surrender of Japan]] in [[World War II]]. The 1905 and 1910 treaties were eventually declared \"null and void\" by both Japan and South Korea in 1965.\n\n==Taish\u014d era (1912\u20131926)==\n{{Main|Taish\u014d period}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Taish\u014d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Emperor Taish\u014d]], the 123rd emperor of Japan]]\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|Japan during World War I|Japanese entry into World War I|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}}\n\nJapan entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1914, seizing the opportunity of Germany's distraction with the European War to expand its sphere of influence in China and the Pacific. Japan declared war on Germany on August 23, 1914. Japanese and allied British Empire forces soon moved to occupy Tsingtao fortress, the [[German East Asia Squadron]] base, German-leased territories in China's [[Shandong|Shandong Province]] as well as the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific, which were part of [[German New Guinea]]. The swift invasion in the German territory of the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] and the [[Siege of Tsingtao]] proved successful. The German colonial troops surrendered on November 7, 1914, and Japan gained the German holdings.\n\n[[File:Jokyoin and Junkei.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Native [[Austronesian]] police officers of [[Truk Island]], circa 1930.

Japan sought further to consolidate its position in China by presenting the [[Twenty-One Demands]] to China in January 1915. In the face of slow negotiations with the Chinese government, widespread [[anti-Japanese sentiment in China]], and international condemnation, Japan withdrew the final group of demands, and treaties were signed in May 1915. The [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] was renewed and expanded in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911, before its demise in 1921. It was officially terminated in 1923.\n\n===Siberian Intervention===\n{{Main|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Siberian Intervention|Japanese intervention in Siberia}}\n\nAfter the fall of the Tsarist regime and the later provisional regime in 1917, the new [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|government]] signed a separate peace [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. After this the Russians fought amongst themselves in [[Russian Civil War|a multi-sided civil war]].\n\nIn July 1918, President Wilson asked the Japanese government to supply 7,000 troops as part of an international coalition of 25,000 troops planned to support the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]]. Prime Minister [[Terauchi Masatake]] agreed to send 12,000 troops but under the Japanese command rather than as part of an international coalition. The Japanese had several hidden motives for the venture, which included an intense hostility and fear of communism; a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia; and the desire to settle the ''\"northern problem\"'' in Japan's security, either through the creation of a buffer state or through outright territorial acquisition.\n\n[[File:Siberia- Civil War and Western Intervention 1918-1920 Q61674.jpg|thumb|left|Commanding Officers and Chiefs of Staff of the Allied Military Mission to [[Siberia]], [[Vladivostok]] during the [[Siberian Intervention|Allied Intervention]]]]\n\nBy November 1918, more than 70,000 [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese troops]] under Chief of Staff Yui Mitsue had occupied all ports and major towns in the [[Primorsky Krai|Russian Maritime Provinces]] and eastern [[Siberia]].

However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of Communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese army provided military support to the Japanese-backed [[Provisional Priamurye Government]] based in Vladivostok against the Moscow-backed [[Far Eastern Republic]].\n\nThe continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and the Russian Far East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and United Kingdom, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister [[Kat\u014d Tomosabur\u014d]] withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922. Japanese casualties from the expedition were 5,000 dead from combat or illness, with the expedition costing over 900 million yen.\n\n===\"Taish\u014d Democracy\"===\n[[File:Itagaki Taisuke.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Count [[Itagaki Taisuke]] is credited as being the first Japanese party leader and an important force for liberalism in Meiji Japan.]]\n\nThe two-party political system that had been developing in Japan since the turn of the century came of age after World War&nbsp;I, giving rise to the nickname for the period, \"Taish\u014d Democracy\". The public grew disillusioned with the growing national debt and the new election laws, which retained the old minimum tax qualifications for voters. Calls were raised for universal suffrage and the dismantling of the old political party network. Students, university professors, and journalists, bolstered by labor unions and inspired by a variety of democratic, socialist, communist, anarchist, and other thoughts, mounted large but orderly public demonstrations in favor of universal male suffrage in 1919 and 1920.\n\n[[File:Takaaki Kato.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Count [[Kat\u014d Takaaki|Kat\u014d Komei]], the 14th [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from June 11, 1924, until his death on January 28, 1926]]\n\nThe election of [[Kat\u014d Takaaki|Kat\u014d Komei]] as Prime Minister of Japan continued democratic reforms that had been advocated by influential individuals on the left. This culminated in the passage of universal male suffrage in March 1925. This bill gave all male subjects over the age of 25 the right to vote, provided they had lived in their electoral districts for at least one year and were not homeless. The electorate thereby increased from 3.3 million to 12.5 million.<ref>Hane, Mikiso, ''Modern Japan: A Historical Survey'' (Oxford: Westview Press, 1992) 234.</ref>\n\nIn the political milieu of the day, there was a proliferation of new parties, including socialist and communist parties. Fear of a broader electorate, left-wing power, and the growing social change led to the passage of the [[Peace Preservation Law]] in 1925, which forbade any change in the political structure or the abolition of private property.\n\nUnstable coalitions and divisiveness in the Diet led the [[Kenseikai]] ({{lang|ja|\u61b2\u653f\u4f1a}} ''Constitutional Government Association'') and the Seiy\u016b Hont\u014d ({{lang|ja|\u653f\u53cb\u672c\u515a}} ''True Seiy\u016bkai'') to merge as the [[Constitutional Democratic Party (Japan)|Rikken Minseit\u014d]] ({{lang|ja|\u7acb\u61b2\u6c11\u653f\u515a}} ''Constitutional Democratic Party'') in 1927. The [[Rikken Minseit\u014d]] platform was committed to the parliamentary system, democratic politics, and world peace. Thereafter, until 1932, the [[Rikken Seiy\u016bkai|Seiy\u016bkai]] and the Rikken Minseit\u014d alternated in power.\n\nDespite the political realignments and hope for more orderly government, domestic economic crises plagued whichever party held power. Fiscal austerity programs and appeals for public support of such conservative government policies as the Peace Preservation Law\u2014including reminders of the moral obligation to make sacrifices for the emperor and the state\u2014were attempted as solutions.\n\n==Early Sh\u014dwa (1926\u20131930)==\n{{Main|Sh\u014dwa period}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Sh\u014dwa Army 1938-1-8.jpg|thumb|[[Hirohito|Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] during an Army inspection on January 8, 1938]]\n\n===Expansion of democracy===\nIn 1932, Park Chun-kum was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] in the [[Japanese general election, 1932|Japanese general election]] as the first person elected from a colonial background.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}<ref name=shugiin150>{{cite web|title=\u7b2c150\u56de\u56fd\u4f1a\u3000\u653f\u6cbb\u502b\u7406\u306e\u78ba\u7acb\u53ca\u3073\u516c\u8077\u9078\u6319\u6cd5\u6539\u6b63\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7279\u5225\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a \u7b2c12\u53f7\u3000\u5e73\u621012\u5e7411\u670816\u65e5\uff08\u6728\u66dc\u65e5\uff09|publisher=House of Representatives of Japan|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_kaigiroku.nsf/html/kaigiroku/007115020001116012.htm?OpenDocument|date=November 16, 2000|accessdate=October 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200616/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_kaigiroku.nsf/html/kaigiroku/007115020001116012.htm?OpenDocument|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> In 1935, democracy was introduced in Taiwan and in response to Taiwanese public opinion, local assemblies were established.<ref name=nittaikyo>{{cite web|title=\u6226\u9593\u671f\u53f0\u6e7e\u5730\u65b9\u9078\u6319\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8003\u5bdf|work=\u53e4\u5e02\u5229\u96c4|publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7814\u7a76\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e9\u30e0 \u3010\u53f0\u6e7e\u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u58c7\u3011|url=http://www.nittaikyo-ei.join-us.jp/koichi.html|accessdate=October 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411052847/http://www.nittaikyo-ei.join-us.jp/koichi.html|archivedate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> In 1942, 38 colonial people were elected to local assemblies of the Japanese homeland.<ref name=shugiin150/>\n\nOverall, during the 1920s, Japan changed its direction toward a democratic system of government. However, [[parliamentary government]] was not rooted deeply enough to withstand the economic and political pressures of the 1930s, during which military leaders became increasingly influential. These shifts in power were made possible by the ambiguity and imprecision of the [[Meiji Constitution]], particularly as regarded the position of the Emperor in relation to the constitution.\n\n===Military and social organizations===\n{{See also|Japanese militarism}}\n\n[[File:Tokyokaikan before.jpg|thumb|left|Tokyo Kaikan was requisitioned as the meeting place for members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (''Taisei Yokusankai'') in the early days.]]\n\nImportant institutional links existed between the party in government ([[K\u014dd\u014dha]]) and military and political organizations, such as the [[Imperial Young Federation]] and the \"Political Department\" of the [[Kempeitai]]. Amongst the himitsu kessha (secret societies), the [[Black Dragon Society|Kokuryu-kai]] and Kokka Shakai Shugi Gakumei (National Socialist League) also had close ties to the government. The [[Tonarigumi]] (residents committee) groups, the Nation Service Society (national government trade union), and [[Imperial Farmers Association]] were all allied as well. Other organizations and groups related with the government in wartime were the [[Double Leaf Society]], [[Kokuhonsha]], [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association|Taisei Yokusankai]], [[Imperial Youth Corps]], [[Police services of the Empire of Japan|Keishich\u014d]] (to 1945), [[State Shinto|Shintoist Rites Research Council]], [[Treaty Faction]], [[Fleet Faction]], and [[Volunteer Fighting Corps]].\n\n===Nationalist factors===\n{{Main|Japanese nationalism|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Imperial Way Faction|May 15 Incident|February 26 Incident}}\n{{Further|Imperial Rule Assistance Association}}\n\n[[File:OKAWA Shumei.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Japanese [[Pan-Asian]] writer [[Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa]]]]\n\n[[Sadao Araki]] was an important figurehead and founder of the Army party and the most important right-wing thinker in his time. His first ideological works date from his leadership of the [[K\u014dd\u014dha]] (Imperial Benevolent Rule or Action Group), opposed by the [[T\u014dseiha]] (Control Group) led by General [[Kazushige Ugaki]]. He linked the ancient (''[[bushido]]'' code) and contemporary local and European fascist ideals (see [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan]]), to form the ideological basis of the movement ([[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Sh\u014dwa nationalism]]).\n\nFrom September 1931, the Japanese were becoming more locked into the course that would lead them into the Second World War, with Araki leading the way. [[Totalitarianism]], [[militarism]], and [[expansionism]] were to become the rule, with fewer voices able to speak against it. In a September 23 news conference, Araki first mentioned the philosophy of \"K\u014dd\u014dha\" (The [[Imperial Way Faction]]). The concept of Kodo linked the Emperor, the people, land, and morality as indivisible. This led to the creation of a \"new\" [[Shinto]] and increased [[Emperor worship]].\n\n[[File:226 Police HQ Rebels.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rebel troops assembling at police headquarters during the [[February 26 Incident]]]]\n\nOn February 26, 1936, a coup d'\u00e9tat was attempted (the [[February 26 Incident]]). Launched by the ultranationalist K\u014dd\u014dha faction with the military, it ultimately failed due to the intervention of the Emperor. K\u014dd\u014dha members were purged from the top military positions and the [[T\u014dseiha]] faction gained dominance. However, both factions believed in expansionism, a strong military, and a coming war. Furthermore, K\u014dd\u014dha members, while removed from the military, still had political influence within the government.\n\nThe state was being transformed to serve the Army and the Emperor. Symbolic [[katana]] swords came back into fashion as the martial embodiment of these beliefs, and the [[Nambu pistol]] became its contemporary equivalent, with the implicit message that the Army doctrine of close combat would prevail. The final objective, as envisioned by Army thinkers such as [[Sadao Araki]] and right-wing line followers, was a return to the old [[Shogunate]] system, but in the form of a contemporary Military Shogunate. In such a government the Emperor would once more be a figurehead (as in the [[Edo period]]). Real power would fall to a leader very similar to a f\u00fchrer or duce, though with the power less nakedly held. On the other hand, the traditionalist Navy militarists defended the Emperor and a constitutional monarchy with a significant religious aspect.\n\nA third point of view was supported by [[Prince Chichibu]], a brother of [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]], who repeatedly counseled him to implement a ''direct imperial rule'', even if that meant suspending the constitution.<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 284</ref>\n\nWith the launching of the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] in 1940 by Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]], Japan would turn to a form of government that resembled [[totalitarianism]]. This unique style of government, very similar to [[fascism]], was known as [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan]].\n\nIn the early twentieth century, a distinctive style of architecture was developed for the empire. Now referred to as [[Imperial Crown Style]] (\u5e1d\u51a0\u69d8\u5f0f, ''teikan y\u014dshiki''), before the end of World War II, it was originally referred to as ''Emperor's Crown Amalgamate Style'', and sometimes ''Emperor's Crown Style'' (\u5e1d\u51a0\u5f0f, Teikanshiki). The style is identified by Japanese-style roofing on top of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styled buildings; and can have a centrally elevated structure with a pyramidal dome. The prototype for this style was developed by architect [[Shimoda Kikutaro]] in his proposal for the Imperial Diet Building (present National Diet Building) in 1920 \u2013 although his proposal was ultimately rejected. Outside of the Japanese mainland, in places like [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]], Imperial Crown Style architecture often included regional architectural elements.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Chia-Hui Lin|title=Heteroglossic Asia: The Transformation of Urban Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYIcBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT85|date=9 January 2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-62637-4|pages=85\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Economic factors===\n[[File:Bank run during the Showa Financial Crisis.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|A bank run during the [[Sh\u014dwa financial crisis]], March 1927]]\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' trading groups (principally [[Mitsubishi]], [[Mitsui]], [[Sumitomo]], and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|Yasuda]]) looked towards great future expansion. Their main concern was a shortage of raw materials. Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]] combined social concerns with the needs of capital, and planned for expansion.\n\nThe main goals of Japan's expansionism were acquisition and protection of spheres of influence, maintenance of territorial integrity, acquisition of raw materials, and access to Asian markets. Western nations, notably Great Britain, France, and the United States, had for long exhibited great interest in the commercial opportunities in China and other parts of Asia. These opportunities had attracted Western investment because of the availability of raw materials for both domestic production and re-export to Asia. Japan desired these opportunities in planning the development of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].\n\nThe [[Great Depression]], just as in many other countries, hindered Japan's economic growth. The Japanese Empire's main problem lay in that rapid industrial expansion had turned the country into a major manufacturing and industrial power that required raw materials; however, these had to be obtained from overseas, as there was a critical lack of natural resources on the home islands.\n\n[[File:National Diet in 1930s.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Diet Building]], 1930]]\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Japan needed to import raw materials such as iron, rubber, and oil to maintain strong economic growth. Most of these resources came from the United States. The Japanese felt that acquiring resource-rich territories would establish economic self-sufficiency and independence, and they also hoped to jump-start the nation's economy in the midst of the depression. As a result, Japan set its sights on [[East Asia]], specifically [[Manchuria]] with its many resources; Japan needed these resources to continue its economic development and maintain national integrity.\n\n==Later Sh\u014dwa (1931\u20131941) \u2013 expansionism and war==\n{{Main|Hakk\u014d ichiu|National Spiritual Mobilization Movement|World War II}}\n\n===Prewar expansionism===\n{{Main|Japanese nationalism|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n\n====Manchuria====\n{{Main|Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Pacification of Manchukuo}}\n\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]], [[Northeast China]] during the [[Mukden Incident]], 1931]]\n\nIn 1931, Japan invaded and conquered Northeast China ([[Manchuria]]) with little resistance. Japan claimed that this invasion was a liberation of the local [[Manchu]]s from the Chinese, although the majority of the population were [[Han Chinese]] as a result of the [[Chuang Guandong|large scale settlement of Chinese in Manchuria]] in the 19th century. Japan then established a [[puppet regime]] called [[Manchukuo]] ({{zh|t=\u6eff\u6d32\u570b}}), and installed the last [[List of emperors of the Qing dynasty|Manchu Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as the official [[head of state]]. [[Jehol Province|Jehol]], a Chinese territory bordering Manchukuo, was later also taken in 1933. This puppet regime had to carry on a protracted pacification campaign against the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] in Manchuria. In 1936, Japan created a similar Mongolian puppet state in Inner Mongolia named [[Mengjiang]] ({{zh|t=\u8499\u7586}}), which was also predominantly Chinese as a result of recent Han immigration to the area. At that time, East Asians were banned from immigration to [[Immigration Act of 1924|North America]] and [[White Australia policy|Australia]], but the newly established Manchukuo was open to immigration of Asians. Japan had an emigration plan to encourage colonization; the Japanese population in Manchuria subsequently grew to 850,000.<ref>Kevin McDowell.

On December 13 of that same year, the Nationalist capital of [[Nanjing]] [[Battle of Nanjing|surrendered to Japanese troops]]. In the event known as the \"[[Nanjing Massacre]]\", Japanese troops massacred a large number of the defending garrison. It is estimated that as many as 200,000 to 300,000 including civilians, may have been killed, although the actual numbers are uncertain and possibly inflated coupled with the fact that the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has never undertaken a full accounting of the massacre. In total, an estimated 20 million Chinese, mostly civilians, were killed during World War II. [[Wang Jingwei regime|A puppet state]] was also set up in China quickly afterwards, headed by [[Wang Jingwei]]. The Second Sino-Japanese War continued into World War II with the Communists and Nationalists in [[Second United Front|a temporary and uneasy nominal alliance]] against the Japanese.\n\n====Clashes with the Soviet Union====\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Khasan|Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact}}\n\nIn 1938, the Japanese 19th Division entered territory claimed by the Soviet Union, leading to the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]]. This incursion was founded in the Japanese belief that the Soviet Union misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary, as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Peking]], between Imperial Russia and Manchu China (and subsequent supplementary agreements on demarcation), and furthermore, that the demarcation markers were tampered with.\n\nOn May 11, 1939, in the Nomonhan Incident ''([[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]])'', a Mongolian cavalry unit of some 70 to 90 men entered the disputed area in search of grazing for their horses, and encountered Manchukuoan cavalry, who drove them out. Two days later the Mongolian force returned and the Manchukoans were unable to evict them.\n\nThe [[IJA 23rd Division]] and other units of the [[Kwantung Army]] then became involved. [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered [[Stavka]], the [[Red Army]]'s high command, to develop a plan for a counterstrike against the Japanese. In late August, [[Georgy Zhukov]] employed encircling tactics that made skillful use of superior artillery, armor, and air forces; this offensive nearly annihilated the 23rd Division and decimated the [[IJA 7th Division]]. On September 15 an armistice was arranged. Nearly two years later, on April 13, 1941, the parties signed a [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]], in which the Soviet Union pledged to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of Manchukuo, while Japan agreed similarly for the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].\n\n===Tripartite Pact===\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact|Axis powers}}\n\n[[File:Signing ceremony for the Axis Powers Tripartite Pact;.jpg|thumb|Signing ceremony for the Axis Powers Tripartite Pact]]\n\nIn 1938, Japan prohibited the expulsion of the [[Jews]] in Japan, [[Manchuria]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] in accordance with the spirit of [[racial equality]] on which Japan had insisted for many years.<ref name=mof>{{cite web|title=Question \u6226\u524d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5bfe\u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u306a\u3057\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4eba\u5bfe\u7b56\u8981\u7db1\u300d\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u53f2\u6599\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u540c\u8981\u7db1\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8aac\u660e\u6587\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/shiryo/qa/senzen_03.html|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}</ref><ref name=gosho>{{cite web|title=\u7336\u592a\u4eba\u5bfe\u7b56\u8981\u7db1|work=Five Ministers Council|publisher=[[National Archives of Japan|Japan Center for Asian Historical Record]]|url=http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&ID=M2006092115064531921|page=36/42|date=December 6, 1938|accessdate=October 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042931/http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&ID=M2006092115064531921|archivedate=July 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanjing Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940\u201341, and with the continuing war in China, the United States and its allies placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[Southeast Asia]]\u2014specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]).\n\nOn September 27, 1940, Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Germany and Italy. Their objectives were to \"establish and maintain a new order of things\" in their respective world regions and spheres of influence, with Germany and Italy in Europe, and Japan in Asia. The signatories of this [[Military alliance|alliance]] became known as the [[Axis Powers]]. The pact also called for mutual protection\u2014if any one of the member powers was attacked by a country not already at war, excluding the [[Soviet Union]]\u2014and for technological and economic cooperation between the signatories.\n\n[[File:Founding Ceremony of the Hakko-Ichiu Monument.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Founding ceremony of the '''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''' (''All the world under one roof'') monument in 1940]]\n\nFor the sake of their own people and nation, Prime Minister Konoe formed the Taisei Yokusankai ([[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]]) on October 12, 1940, as a ruling party in Japan.\n\n==Pacific War (1941\u20131945) (World War II)==\n{{Main|Japan during World War II|Pacific War}}\n\n[[File:Second world war asia 1937-1942 map en6.png|thumb|upright=1.2|A map of the Japanese advance from 1937 to 1942]]\n\nFacing an oil embargo by the United States as well as dwindling domestic reserves, the Japanese government decided to execute a plan developed by [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to attack the United States Pacific Fleet in Hawaii. While the United States was [[neutral country|neutral]] and continued negotiating with Japan for possible peace in Asia, the Imperial Japanese Navy at the same time made its surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Honolulu]] on December 7, 1941. As a result, the U.S. battleship fleet was decimated and almost 2,500 people died in the attack that day. The primary objective of the attack was to incapacitate the United States long enough for Japan to establish its long-planned South East Asian empire and defensible buffer zones. The American public saw the attack as barbaric and treacherous and rallied against the Japanese. Four days later, [[Adolf Hitler]] of Germany, and [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy declared war on the United States, merging the separate conflicts. The United States entered the [[European Theatre]] and [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in full force, thereby bringing the United States to World War II on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\n===Japanese conquests===\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese launched offensives against Allied forces in East and Southeast Asia, with simultaneous attacks in [[History of colonial Hong Kong|British Hong Kong]], [[British Malaya]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]]. [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong surrendered]] to the Japanese on December 25. In [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] the Japanese overwhelmed an Allied army composed of British, Indian, [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] forces. The Japanese were quickly able to advance down the [[Malayan Peninsula]], forcing the Allied forces to retreat towards [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. The Allies lacked aircover and tanks; the Japanese had complete air superiority. The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of HMS ''Prince of Wales'' and HMS ''Repulse'']] on December 10, 1941, led to the east coast of Malaya being exposed to Japanese landings and the elimination of British naval power in the area. By the end of January 1942, the last Allied forces crossed the strait of Johore and into Singapore.\n\n[[File:JapaneseMarchSgpCity.jpg|thumb|Victorious Japanese troops march through the city center of [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] following the [[Battle of Singapore|city's capture]] in February 1942 (Photo from the [[Imperial War Museum]])]]\n\nIn [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|the Philippines]], the Japanese pushed the combined American-Filipino force towards [[Battle of Bataan|the Bataan Peninsula]] and later the [[Battle of Corregidor|island of Corregidor]]. By January 1942, [[General Douglas MacArthur]] and President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] were [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|forced to flee]] in the face of Japanese advance. This marked among one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans, leaving over 70,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war in the custody of the Japanese. On February 15, 1942, [[Straits Settlements|Singapore]], due to the overwhelming superiority of Japanese forces and encirclement tactics, [[Battle of Singapore|fell to the Japanese]], causing the largest [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] of British-led military personnel in history. An estimated 80,000 Australian, British and Indian troops were taken as [[prisoners of war]], joining 50,000 taken in the [[Battle of Malaya|Japanese invasion of Malaya]] (modern day [[Malaysia]]).

This, coupled with the losses inflicted by [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|Allied submarines]] on Japanese shipping routes, began to strangle Japan's economy and undermine its ability to supply its army. By early 1945, the US Marines had wrested control of the [[Ogasawara Islands]] in several hard-fought battles such as the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], marking the beginning of the fall of the islands of Japan. After securing airfields in [[Saipan]] and [[Guam]] in the summer of 1944, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] conducted an intense [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] by having [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers in nighttime low altitude incendiary raids, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's war industry and [[demoralization (warfare)|shatter its morale]]. The [[Operation Meetinghouse]] raid on Tokyo on the night of March 9\u201310, 1945, led to the deaths of approximately 120,000 civilians. Approximately 350,000\u2013500,000 civilians died in 67 Japanese cities as a result of the [[Firebombing|incendiary bombing]] campaign on Japan. Concurrent with these attacks, Japan's vital coastal shipping operations were severely hampered with extensive aerial mining by the US's [[Operation Starvation]]. Regardless, these efforts did not succeed in persuading the Japanese military to surrender. In mid-August 1945, the United States dropped [[nuclear weapon]]s on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. These bombings were the first and only combat use of nuclear weaponry. These two bombs killed approximately 120,000 people in a matter of minutes, and as many as a result of [[nuclear radiation]] in the following weeks, months and years. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945.\n\nAt the [[Yalta agreement]], the US, the UK, and the USSR had agreed that the USSR would enter the war on Japan within three months of the defeat of Germany in Europe. This [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War]] led to the fall of Japan's Manchurian occupation, Soviet occupation of [[South Sakhalin]] island, and a real, imminent threat of Soviet invasion of the home islands of Japan. This was a significant factor for some internal parties in the Japanese decision to surrender to the US<ref>Racing the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan Tsuyoshi Hasegawa Belknap Press (October 30, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0674022416}}</ref> and gain some protection, rather than face simultaneous Soviet invasion as well as defeat by the US and its allies.

With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war's wake, erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice. Politically, economically, and socially Japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust. ... I sent all four of our occupation divisions to the Korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon Japan. The results fully justified my faith. I know of no nation more serene, orderly, and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race.</blockquote>\n\nFor historian [[John W. Dower]]:\n<blockquote>In retrospect, apart from the military officer corps, the purge of alleged militarists and ultranationalists that was conducted under the Occupation had relatively small impact on the long-term composition of men of influence in the public and private sectors. The purge initially brought new blood into the political parties, but this was offset by the return of huge numbers of formerly purged conservative politicians to national as well as local politics in the early 1950s. In the bureaucracy, the purge was negligible from the outset. ... In the economic sector, the purge similarly was only mildly disruptive, affecting less than sixteen hundred individuals spread among some four hundred companies. Everywhere one looks, the corridors of power in postwar Japan are crowded with men whose talents had already been recognized during the war years, and who found the same talents highly prized in the 'new' Japan.<ref>J.

The [[short title]] of the act of the British Parliament is ''Union with Ireland Act 1800'', assigned by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]. The short title of the act of the Irish Parliament is ''Act of Union (Ireland) 1800'', assigned by a 1951 act of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], and hence not effective in the Republic of Ireland, where it was referred to by its long title when repealed in 1962.\n\n==Background==\n\nBefore these Acts, Ireland had been in [[personal union]] with England since 1541, when the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] had passed the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], proclaiming King [[Henry VIII of England]] to be [[King of Ireland]]. Since the 12th century, the King of England had been technical overlord of the [[Lordship of Ireland]], a papal possession. Both the Kingdoms of Ireland and England later came into personal union with that of [[Scotland]] upon the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603.\n\nIn 1707, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were united into a single kingdom: the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Upon that union, each House of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed a congratulatory address to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], praying that, \"May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union\".<ref>Journals of the Irish Commons, vol. iii. p. 421</ref> The Irish Parliament at that time was subject to a [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|number of restrictions]] that placed it subservient to the [[Parliament of England]] (and following the union of England and Scotland, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]); however, Ireland gained effective legislative independence from Great Britain through the [[Constitution of 1782]].\n\nBy this time access to institutional power in Ireland was restricted to a small minority, the [[Anglo-Irish]] of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], and frustration at the lack of reform among the Catholic majority eventually led, along with other reasons, to a [[1798 Rebellion|rebellion in 1798]], involving [[French expedition to Ireland (1796)|a French invasion of Ireland]] and the seeking of complete independence from Great Britain. This rebellion was crushed with much bloodshed, and the subsequent drive for union between Great Britain and Ireland that passed in 1800 was motivated at least in part by the belief that the rebellion was caused as much by reactionary loyalist brutality as by the United Irishmen.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nFurthermore, Catholic emancipation was being discussed in Great Britain, and fears that a newly enfranchised Catholic majority would drastically change the character of the Irish government and parliament also contributed to a desire from London to merge the Parliaments.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Passing the Acts ==\n\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}\n\nComplementary acts had to be passed in the Parliament of Great Britain and in the Parliament of Ireland.\n\nThe Parliament of Ireland had recently gained a large measure of legislative independence under the [[Constitution of 1782]].  Many members of the Irish Parliament jealously guarded this autonomy (notably [[Henry Grattan]]) and a motion for union was legally rejected in 1799.\n\nOnly [[Church of Ireland|Anglicans]] were permitted to become members of the Parliament of Ireland, though the great majority of the Irish population were [[Roman Catholic]], with many [[Presbyterian]]s in [[Ulster]]. In 1793 Roman Catholics regained the right to vote if they owned or rented property worth \u00a32 p.a. The Catholic hierarchy was strongly in favour of union, hoping for rapid [[Catholic emancipation|emancipation]] and the right to sit as MPs \u2013 which was however delayed after the passage of the acts until [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829| 1829]].\n\nFrom the perspective of Great Britain, the union was desirable because of the uncertainty that followed the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789; if Ireland adopted Catholic Emancipation, willingly or not, a Roman Catholic Parliament could break away from Britain and ally with the French, while the same measure within a united kingdom would exclude that possibility. Also the Irish and British Parliaments, when creating a regency during [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s \"madness\", gave the Prince Regent different powers. These considerations led Great Britain to decide to attempt merger of the two kingdoms and their Parliaments.\n\nThe final passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was achieved with substantial majorities, in part according to contemporary documents through bribery, namely the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[honour]]s to critics to get their votes.<ref name=Ward1994p28>Alan J.

The [[short title]] of the act of the British Parliament is ''Union with Ireland Act 1800'', assigned by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]. The short title of the act of the Irish Parliament is ''Act of Union (Ireland) 1800'', assigned by a 1951 act of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], and hence not effective in the Republic of Ireland, where it was referred to by its long title when repealed in 1962.\n\n==Background==\n\nBefore these Acts, Ireland had been in [[personal union]] with England since 1541, when the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] had passed the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], proclaiming King [[Henry VIII of England]] to be [[King of Ireland]]. Since the 12th century, the King of England had been technical overlord of the [[Lordship of Ireland]], a papal possession. Both the Kingdoms of Ireland and England later came into personal union with that of [[Scotland]] upon the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603.\n\nIn 1707, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were united into a single kingdom: the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Upon that union, each House of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed a congratulatory address to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], praying that, \"May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union\".<ref>Journals of the Irish Commons, vol. iii. p. 421</ref> The Irish Parliament at that time was subject to a [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|number of restrictions]] that placed it subservient to the [[Parliament of England]] (and following the union of England and Scotland, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]); however, Ireland gained effective legislative independence from Great Britain through the [[Constitution of 1782]].\n\nBy this time access to institutional power in Ireland was restricted to a small minority, the [[Anglo-Irish]] of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], and frustration at the lack of reform among the Catholic majority eventually led, along with other reasons, to a [[1798 Rebellion|rebellion in 1798]], involving [[French expedition to Ireland (1796)|a French invasion of Ireland]] and the seeking of complete independence from Great Britain. This rebellion was crushed with much bloodshed, and the subsequent drive for union between Great Britain and Ireland that passed in 1800 was motivated at least in part by the belief that the rebellion was caused as much by reactionary loyalist brutality as by the United Irishmen.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nFurthermore, Catholic emancipation was being discussed in Great Britain, and fears that a newly enfranchised Catholic majority would drastically change the character of the Irish government and parliament also contributed to a desire from London to merge the Parliaments.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Passing the Acts ==\n\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}\n\nComplementary acts had to be passed in the Parliament of Great Britain and in the Parliament of Ireland.\n\nThe Parliament of Ireland had recently gained a large measure of legislative independence under the [[Constitution of 1782]].  Many members of the Irish Parliament jealously guarded this autonomy (notably [[Henry Grattan]]) and a motion for union was legally rejected in 1799.\n\nOnly [[Church of Ireland|Anglicans]] were permitted to become members of the Parliament of Ireland, though the great majority of the Irish population were [[Roman Catholic]], with many [[Presbyterian]]s in [[Ulster]]. In 1793 Roman Catholics regained the right to vote if they owned or rented property worth \u00a32 p.a. The Catholic hierarchy was strongly in favour of union, hoping for rapid [[Catholic emancipation|emancipation]] and the right to sit as MPs \u2013 which was however delayed after the passage of the acts until [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829| 1829]].\n\nFrom the perspective of Great Britain, the union was desirable because of the uncertainty that followed the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789; if Ireland adopted Catholic Emancipation, willingly or not, a Roman Catholic Parliament could break away from Britain and ally with the French, while the same measure within a united kingdom would exclude that possibility. Also the Irish and British Parliaments, when creating a regency during [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s \"madness\", gave the Prince Regent different powers. These considerations led Great Britain to decide to attempt merger of the two kingdoms and their Parliaments.\n\nThe final passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was achieved with substantial majorities, in part according to contemporary documents through bribery, namely the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[honour]]s to critics to get their votes.<ref name=Ward1994p28>Alan J.

Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n, also known as [[Guatemala City]].\n\nThe territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]]. Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.\n\nFrom the mid- to late-19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. In 1944, the authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}\n\nFrom 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3\u201315}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGuatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes many endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guatemala\" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n'' [[:nah:Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n|(nahwiki)]], or \"place of many trees\", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for \"many trees\"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or perhaps more specifically for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]].

Many outside influences are found in [[Maya art]] and architecture, which are thought to be the result of trade and cultural exchange rather than direct external conquest.\n\n==== Archaeological investigation ====\nIn 2018, 60,000 uncharted structures were revealed by archaeologists with the help of [[Lidar]] technology lasers in northern Guatemala. The project applied Lidar technology on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is overwhelming finding in over 150 years of Maya archaeology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/archaeologists-find-ancient-lost-cities-using-lasers/ar-BBNIdqB|title=Archaeologists Find Ancient Lost Cities Using Lasers|website=msn.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=1 February 2018|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/archaeologists-find-ancient-cities-using-lasers-1145042|title=ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ANCIENT MAYAN LOST CITIES IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|website=BBC News|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/ancient-maya-structures-guatemala-lasers|title=Lasers Reveal 60,000 Ancient Maya Structures in Guatemala|last=Little|first=Becky|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hidden-ancient-mayan-apos-megalopolis-110002872.html|title=Hidden Ancient Mayan 'Megalopolis' With 60,000 Structures Discovered in Guatemala Using Lasers|website=yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/60000-lost-mayan-structures-found-beneath-guatemalan-jungle-2018-2|title=Archaeologists found thousands of hidden structures in the Guatemalan jungle \u2013 and it could re-write human history|last=Berke|first=Jeremy|website=Business Insider|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hidden-ancient-mayan-megalopolis-60000-structures-discovered-guatemala-using-797865|title=HIDDEN ANCIENT MAYAN 'MEGALOPOLIS' WITH 60,000 STRUCTURES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olodonation.com/2018/09/30/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mayan-lost-city-in-northern-guatemala-using-lasers/|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Mayan Lost City in Northern Guatemala Using Lasers|last=Chukwurah|first=Precious|date=30 September 2018|website=Nigeria's Entertainment News, Music, Video, Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/09/27/this-major-discovery-upends-long-held-theories-about-maya-civilization/?_ga=2.164638527.1462411402.1566373807-1089594517.1566373807&noredirect=on|title=This major discovery upends long-held theories about the Maya civilization|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2018/02/02/mayan-megacity-discovered-guatemala-jungle/|title=Archaeologists discovered an ancient Mayan megacity hidden in a Guatemalan jungle|last=Wehner|first=Mike|date=2 February 2018|website=BGR|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Colonial era (1519\u20131821) ===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|upright|The ''Conquistador'' [[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial Spanish efforts to conquer Guatemala.<ref name=\"Lovell05p58\">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>|alt=Painting of a bearded man in early 16th-century attire including prominent ruff collar, wearing a decorative breastplate, with his right hand resting on his hip and his left hand grasping a cane, or riding crop.]]\n\nAfter they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519.

The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains.{{sfn |Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=86}} Believing Carrera totally defeated, Moraz\u00e1n and Barrundia marched to [[Guatemala City]], and were welcomed as saviors by state governor [[Pedro Valenzuela]] and members of the conservative {{ILL|Aycinena clan|es|Clan Aycinena}}, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Moraz\u00e1n all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison |2008 |p = 87}} The [[criollo people|criollos]] of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Moraz\u00e1n, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008 |p = 88}}\n\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1830 na.png|thumb|The [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (1823\u20131838) with its capital in Guatemala City.]]\nMoraz\u00e1n used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with [[Mariano Rivera Paz]], a member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol]] voted to dissolve the [[Central American Federation]] in [[San Salvador]] a little later, forcing Moraz\u00e1n to return to El Salvador to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Moraz\u00e1n increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera.{{Sfn |Gonz\u00e1lez Davison |2008 |p = 89}} Knowing that Moraz\u00e1n had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take [[Salam\u00e1]] with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to [[Sanarate]].{{sfn |Gonz\u00e1lez Davison |2008 |p = 91-92}} After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in [[Jutiapa]] and got a small amount of booty which he gave to the volunteers who accompanied him.

Moraz\u00e1n had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not, because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of [[Francisco Ferrera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Instead, Moraz\u00e1n left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons. Knowing that Moraz\u00e1n was going to attack El Salvador, [[Francisco Ferrera]] gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City.{{sfn |Gonz\u00e1lez Davison |2008 |p = 96}}\n\nMeanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitively crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the Guatemalan capital, in place since the battle of Villa Nueva.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1959|p =20 April}} Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera took Guatemala City by surprise on 13 April 1839; Salazar, [[Mariano G\u00e1lvez]] and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera's militia men.

Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts \u2013 Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitep\u00e9quez as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n went to [[Antigua, Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm\u00e1n defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzm\u00e1n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: \"Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!\"{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera.

Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named \"La Monta\u00f1a\" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].\n\nIn 1854 Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.\n\nHis rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.\n\n=== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865\u20131871) ===\n[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of Guatemala from 1865 to 1871.]]\n{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of Guatemala]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |title       = Vicente Cerna\n |author      = prensalibre.com\n |accessdate  = 5 September 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175325/http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |archivedate = 6 January 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Liberal author {{ILL|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} {{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|s.f.|p=106}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n{{quote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military.

During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him.

During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first \"[[Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana]]\" (\"Central American Fair\") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.\n\nHis administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920) ===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\n[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\n=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931\u20131944) ===\n{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}\nThe [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for \"efficiency and cruelty\" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12\u201315}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10\u201311}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29\u201332}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}\n\nUbico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s.

Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains.\n\nAll major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Pet\u00e9n is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.\n\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Sarstoon River|Sarst\u00fan,]] which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Pet\u00e9n and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\n[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]\nGuatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.\n\nGuatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1]].\n\nNatural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world.

Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.\n\nIn 1945, in order to overcome \"the Indian problem\", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201386, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanizaci\u00f3n|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Guatemala}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in Guatemala}}\n[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]\n\n[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.\n\nSince the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has grown from 40,000 members in 1984 to 164,000 in 1998, and continues to expand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |accessdate=3 February 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/quetzaltenango-guatemala-temple/ |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala LDS (Mormon) Temple |publisher=Ldschurchtemples.com |accessdate=3 February 2015  }}</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Guatemala has been especially strong, with hundreds of thousands of converts in the last five years,<ref name=EOC3>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Fr.

Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}\nSince the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many contemporary music groups in Guatemala play [[Caribbean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]]-influenced [[punta]], [[Latin pop]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican regional]], and [[mariachi]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Guatemalan cuisine}}\n[[File:091225 tamales.JPG|thumb|Black and red [[tamale]]s in Guatemala]]\nMany traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Football ====\n{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]]. However, the team has failed to qualify to a [[FIFA World Cup]] so far. Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.\n\n==== Futsal ====\n\n[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].\n\nGuatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round. It has also participated in every [[Grand Prix de Futsal]] since [[2009 Grand Prix de Futsal|2009]], reaching the semifinals in [[2014 Grand Prix de Futsal|2014]].\n\n==== Olympics ====\n{{Further|Guatemala at the Olympics}}\nThe [[Guatemalan Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1947 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year. Guatemala participated in the [[Guatemala at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]], and in every edition since the [[Guatemala at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]]. It has also appeared in a single [[Winter Olympics]] edition, in [[Guatemala at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].\n\n[[Erick Barrondo]] won the only Olympic medal for Guatemala so far, silver in [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 20 kilometres walk|race walking]] at the [[Guatemala at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==== Other sports ====\nGuatemala also keeps [[National sports teams of Guatemala|national sports teams]] in several disciplines.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Guatemala|Latin America}}\n* [[Index of Guatemala-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Guatemala]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aguirre |first=Lily |title=The land of eternal spring: Guatemala, my beautiful country |year=1949 |publisher=Patio Press |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LodnAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|title=\u00a1Ecce Pericles!|publisher= Tipograf\u00eda Nacional|location=Guatemala|year= 1945|ref=harv|language=Spanish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190285559/Arevalo-Martinez-Ecce-Pericles#scribd}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concordatoen00unseguat|last=Aycinena|first=Pedro de|author-link=Pedro de Aycinena|title=Concordato entre la Santa Sede y el presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Guatemala|publisher=Imprenta La Paz|year=1854|location=Guatemala|language=Latin, Spanish|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Banco de Guatemala |url=http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/en/currency%20and%20bills/Monedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&e=18108 |title=Ilustraciones de Cada una de las 11 Denominaciones.

Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n, also known as [[Guatemala City]].\n\nThe territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]]. Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.\n\nFrom the mid- to late-19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. In 1944, the authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}\n\nFrom 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3\u201315}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGuatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes many endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guatemala\" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n'' [[:nah:Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n|(nahwiki)]], or \"place of many trees\", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for \"many trees\"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or perhaps more specifically for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]].

The project applied Lidar technology on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is overwhelming finding in over 150 years of Maya archaeology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/archaeologists-find-ancient-lost-cities-using-lasers/ar-BBNIdqB|title=Archaeologists Find Ancient Lost Cities Using Lasers|website=msn.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=1 February 2018|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/archaeologists-find-ancient-cities-using-lasers-1145042|title=ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ANCIENT MAYAN LOST CITIES IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|website=BBC News|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/ancient-maya-structures-guatemala-lasers|title=Lasers Reveal 60,000 Ancient Maya Structures in Guatemala|last=Little|first=Becky|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hidden-ancient-mayan-apos-megalopolis-110002872.html|title=Hidden Ancient Mayan 'Megalopolis' With 60,000 Structures Discovered in Guatemala Using Lasers|website=yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/60000-lost-mayan-structures-found-beneath-guatemalan-jungle-2018-2|title=Archaeologists found thousands of hidden structures in the Guatemalan jungle \u2013 and it could re-write human history|last=Berke|first=Jeremy|website=Business Insider|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hidden-ancient-mayan-megalopolis-60000-structures-discovered-guatemala-using-797865|title=HIDDEN ANCIENT MAYAN 'MEGALOPOLIS' WITH 60,000 STRUCTURES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olodonation.com/2018/09/30/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mayan-lost-city-in-northern-guatemala-using-lasers/|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Mayan Lost City in Northern Guatemala Using Lasers|last=Chukwurah|first=Precious|date=30 September 2018|website=Nigeria's Entertainment News, Music, Video, Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/09/27/this-major-discovery-upends-long-held-theories-about-maya-civilization/?_ga=2.164638527.1462411402.1566373807-1089594517.1566373807&noredirect=on|title=This major discovery upends long-held theories about the Maya civilization|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2018/02/02/mayan-megacity-discovered-guatemala-jungle/|title=Archaeologists discovered an ancient Mayan megacity hidden in a Guatemalan jungle|last=Wehner|first=Mike|date=2 February 2018|website=BGR|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Colonial era (1519\u20131821) ===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|upright|The ''Conquistador'' [[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial Spanish efforts to conquer Guatemala.<ref name=\"Lovell05p58\">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>|alt=Painting of a bearded man in early 16th-century attire including prominent ruff collar, wearing a decorative breastplate, with his right hand resting on his hip and his left hand grasping a cane, or riding crop.]]\n\nAfter they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519.

Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named \"La Monta\u00f1a\" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].\n\nIn 1854 Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor.

While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.\n\nHis rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.\n\n=== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865\u20131871) ===\n[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of Guatemala from 1865 to 1871.]]\n{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of Guatemala]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |title       = Vicente Cerna\n |author      = prensalibre.com\n |accessdate  = 5 September 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175325/http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |archivedate = 6 January 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Liberal author {{ILL|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} {{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|s.f.|p=106}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n{{quote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military.

During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p = 82}}\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first \"[[Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana]]\" (\"Central American Fair\") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.\n\nHis administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920) ===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\n[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\n=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931\u20131944) ===\n{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}\nThe [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for \"efficiency and cruelty\" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12\u201315}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10\u201311}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29\u201332}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}\n\nUbico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67\u201371}}\n\nUbico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US declared war against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be \"another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]\".{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38\u201339}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances.

Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains.\n\nAll major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Pet\u00e9n is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.\n\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Sarstoon River|Sarst\u00fan,]] which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Pet\u00e9n and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\n[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]\nGuatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.\n\nGuatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1]].\n\nNatural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world.

Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.\n\nIn 1945, in order to overcome \"the Indian problem\", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201386, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanizaci\u00f3n|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Guatemala}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in Guatemala}}\n[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]\n\n[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.\n\nSince the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries.

Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}\nSince the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many contemporary music groups in Guatemala play [[Caribbean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]]-influenced [[punta]], [[Latin pop]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican regional]], and [[mariachi]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Guatemalan cuisine}}\n[[File:091225 tamales.JPG|thumb|Black and red [[tamale]]s in Guatemala]]\nMany traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Football ====\n{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]].

Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.\n\n==== Futsal ====\n\n[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].\n\nGuatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round. It has also participated in every [[Grand Prix de Futsal]] since [[2009 Grand Prix de Futsal|2009]], reaching the semifinals in [[2014 Grand Prix de Futsal|2014]].\n\n==== Olympics ====\n{{Further|Guatemala at the Olympics}}\nThe [[Guatemalan Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1947 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year. Guatemala participated in the [[Guatemala at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]], and in every edition since the [[Guatemala at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]]. It has also appeared in a single [[Winter Olympics]] edition, in [[Guatemala at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].\n\n[[Erick Barrondo]] won the only Olympic medal for Guatemala so far, silver in [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 20 kilometres walk|race walking]] at the [[Guatemala at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==== Other sports ====\nGuatemala also keeps [[National sports teams of Guatemala|national sports teams]] in several disciplines.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Guatemala|Latin America}}\n* [[Index of Guatemala-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Guatemala]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aguirre |first=Lily |title=The land of eternal spring: Guatemala, my beautiful country |year=1949 |publisher=Patio Press |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LodnAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|title=\u00a1Ecce Pericles!|publisher= Tipograf\u00eda Nacional|location=Guatemala|year= 1945|ref=harv|language=Spanish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190285559/Arevalo-Martinez-Ecce-Pericles#scribd}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concordatoen00unseguat|last=Aycinena|first=Pedro de|author-link=Pedro de Aycinena|title=Concordato entre la Santa Sede y el presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Guatemala|publisher=Imprenta La Paz|year=1854|location=Guatemala|language=Latin, Spanish|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Banco de Guatemala |url=http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/en/currency%20and%20bills/Monedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&e=18108 |title=Ilustraciones de Cada una de las 11 Denominaciones.

Cardiac contractility modulation therapy aims to treat heart failure through a medium- to long-term treatment, over the course of weeks and months.\n\nAccording to large implanting clinics, after the implantation wound is healed, the lifestyle of a patient is not restricted by the implanted device.<ref name=\"Pacemaker life2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Living-With-Your-Pacemaker_UCM_305290_Article.jsp Tips by the American Heart Associuation \"Living With Your Pacemaker\"]</ref> Leisure, travel (by car, train, ship or plane), hobbies and sex life will not be restricted. The patient may perceive an improved capacity for these activities and overall enhanced performance and exercise capacity in response to the actual therapy.\n\n==Contraindications ==\nIn the past, the most important contraindication in Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was permanent and long-standing persistent [[atrial fibrillation]]. The signal application in current Cardiac contractility modulation devices was timed and triggered according to the electrical activity of the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]]. In atrial fibrillation, electrical activity in the atrium is severely disturbed and is therefore not a reliable basis for the triggering of Cardiac contractility modulation signals. This also applies to other diseases involving severe disturbance in electrical atrial sensing.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ger 2014a2\">{{cite journal|last=R\u00f6ger|first=S.|display-authors=etal|date=Apr 2014|title=Cardiac contractility modulation: first experience in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and permanent atrial fibrillation|journal=Europace|volume=16|issue=8|pages=1205\u20139|doi=10.1093/europace/euu050|pmid=24706089}}<!--| accessdate = Oct 14, 2014--></ref> Requests have been raised in scientific literature for an improved Cardiac contractility modulation algorithm which would allow the therapy to be delivered independently from any atrial signal.

In some instances it may be impossible to guide the leads through the main veins in the upper half of the body to the heart due to [[venous thrombosis]], for example [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker#mode|VVI pacemakers]], in the case of 100% stimulation, are also contraindicated.<ref name=\"Abraham 20134\" />\n\n== Side effects ==\nThe most frequently encountered adverse events related to Cardiac contractility modulation therapy are lead fracture or lead dislodgement.<ref name=\"Kadish 20112\" /> Other reported complications include:\n* Infection and bleeding at the IPG implantation site\n* Accumulation of fluid in the pericardium ([[pericardial effusion]])<ref name=\"Borggrefe 20082\" />\n\nThese side effects are similar to those that occur with other electrical stimulation therapies, such as pacemakers, CRT devices or ICD devices.<ref name=\"Pakarinen 20102\" /> Furthermore, recorded complications did not differ between patients with activated or deactivated Cardiac contractility modulation devices.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\nOverall, Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was demonstrated to have no negative impact on health markers.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\n=== Precautions ===\n\n[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Metal detectors used for security screening]]\nSimilarly to patients with other electrical stimulation devices, patients with a Cardiac contractility modulation device must follow certain precautions arising from the device implantation and its function.\n* Electromagnetic fields: Strong electromagnetic fields can interfere with the function of the device.

This increases the muscle contraction strength. Additionally, within minutes, cell [[metabolism]] and [[gene expression]], which are typically abnormal in heart failure, improve towards their normal state.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> This beneficial effect occurs initially only in the area adjacent to the electrodes, but with time also spreads to remote areas of the cardiac muscle.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> Cardiac contractility modulation therefore restores the structure and function of damaged cells back towards their normal state.

Mortality rates were significantly lower than predicted at year 1, and lower than predicted but not statistically significant at year 3.\n\n==== General ====\n\nHeart failure is a chronic disease that usually progresses gradually.<ref name=\"ESC Guideline2\" /> The rate of progression and the degree of symptoms of the disease varies between different patients. Cardiac contractility modulation therapy aims to treat heart failure through a medium- to long-term treatment, over the course of weeks and months.\n\nAccording to large implanting clinics, after the implantation wound is healed, the lifestyle of a patient is not restricted by the implanted device.<ref name=\"Pacemaker life2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Living-With-Your-Pacemaker_UCM_305290_Article.jsp Tips by the American Heart Associuation \"Living With Your Pacemaker\"]</ref> Leisure, travel (by car, train, ship or plane), hobbies and sex life will not be restricted. The patient may perceive an improved capacity for these activities and overall enhanced performance and exercise capacity in response to the actual therapy.\n\n==Contraindications ==\nIn the past, the most important contraindication in Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was permanent and long-standing persistent [[atrial fibrillation]]. The signal application in current Cardiac contractility modulation devices was timed and triggered according to the electrical activity of the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]]. In atrial fibrillation, electrical activity in the atrium is severely disturbed and is therefore not a reliable basis for the triggering of Cardiac contractility modulation signals. This also applies to other diseases involving severe disturbance in electrical atrial sensing.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ger 2014a2\">{{cite journal|last=R\u00f6ger|first=S.|display-authors=etal|date=Apr 2014|title=Cardiac contractility modulation: first experience in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and permanent atrial fibrillation|journal=Europace|volume=16|issue=8|pages=1205\u20139|doi=10.1093/europace/euu050|pmid=24706089}}<!--| accessdate = Oct 14, 2014--></ref> Requests have been raised in scientific literature for an improved Cardiac contractility modulation algorithm which would allow the therapy to be delivered independently from any atrial signal. A pioneering study had shown that an improved Cardiac contractility modulation algorithm could make the therapy an effective treatment for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ger 2014a2\" /> Following these study results the new generation was developed and can now offer Cardiac contractility modulation therapy also for patients with [[atrial fibrillation]].\n\nOther irregular rhythms, including frequent [[premature ventricular contraction]]s (ventricular extra systoles) or a distinct signal transduction disorder in the heart (untreated [[AV block]] of more than 300 ms), may represent contraindications. CRT treatment should be considered in lieu of Cardiac contractility modulation in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a QRS duration of over 120 ms, or when the QRS duration is greater than 150 ms and independent of LBBB.<ref name=\"Abraham 20134\" /><ref name=\"ESC Guideline2\" />\n\nAs with conventional pacemaker therapy, the Cardiac contractility modulation device cannot be implanted if the leads cannot be positioned appropriately in the heart. In cases where there is an [[artificial heart valve]] between the right atrium and ventricle (a mechanical prosthetic tricuspid valve), the valve function could be greatly affected by the ventricular leads. In some instances it may be impossible to guide the leads through the main veins in the upper half of the body to the heart due to [[venous thrombosis]], for example [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker#mode|VVI pacemakers]], in the case of 100% stimulation, are also contraindicated.<ref name=\"Abraham 20134\" />\n\n== Side effects ==\nThe most frequently encountered adverse events related to Cardiac contractility modulation therapy are lead fracture or lead dislodgement.<ref name=\"Kadish 20112\" /> Other reported complications include:\n* Infection and bleeding at the IPG implantation site\n* Accumulation of fluid in the pericardium ([[pericardial effusion]])<ref name=\"Borggrefe 20082\" />\n\nThese side effects are similar to those that occur with other electrical stimulation therapies, such as pacemakers, CRT devices or ICD devices.<ref name=\"Pakarinen 20102\" /> Furthermore, recorded complications did not differ between patients with activated or deactivated Cardiac contractility modulation devices.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\nOverall, Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was demonstrated to have no negative impact on health markers.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\n=== Precautions ===\n\n[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Metal detectors used for security screening]]\nSimilarly to patients with other electrical stimulation devices, patients with a Cardiac contractility modulation device must follow certain precautions arising from the device implantation and its function.\n* Electromagnetic fields: Strong electromagnetic fields can interfere with the function of the device. Most interference will lead to inhibition of Cardiac contractility modulation signal delivery. Once away from the field, the device will resume its normal function in most cases. The electromagnetic fields of household appliances are usually considered harmless.<ref name=\"Pacemaker EM-fields2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Implantable-Cardioverter-Defibrillator-ICD_UCM_448478_Article.jsp Safety recommendations of the American Heart Association for patients with artificial pacemakers]</ref><ref name=\"ICD EM-fields2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Implantable-Cardioverter-Defibrillator-ICD_UCM_448478_Article.jsp Safety recommendations of the American Heart Association for patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)]</ref>\n* Mobile phones: Similarly to other electrical stimulation devices, such as pacemakers, aside from a recommended safety distance of 10\u201315&nbsp;cm (4-6 inches) between the device and mobile phones, there are no restrictions on the use of mobile phones.<ref name=\"Pacemaker EM-fields2\" />\n* Security checks: Full body or hand-held metal detectors, such as those used at airport security controls, do not usually affect the function of the device.

This increases the muscle contraction strength. Additionally, within minutes, cell [[metabolism]] and [[gene expression]], which are typically abnormal in heart failure, improve towards their normal state.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> This beneficial effect occurs initially only in the area adjacent to the electrodes, but with time also spreads to remote areas of the cardiac muscle.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> Cardiac contractility modulation therefore restores the structure and function of damaged cells back towards their normal state.

The city was also the first large American city where, in the 1920s, major clusters of regional employment, shopping, and culture were already being built outside the traditional downtown areas \u2013 in [[edge cities]] such as [[Mid-Wilshire]], [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] and [[Hollywood]]. This pattern of growth continued ever outward, more so when the freeway system was built starting in the 1950s; thus Greater Los Angeles was the earliest large American metropolitan area with a [[decentralization|decentralized]] structure. Its major commercial, financial, and cultural institutions are geographically dispersed rather than being concentrated in a single [[downtown]] or central area. Also, the population [[Population density|density]] of [[Los Angeles]] proper is low (approximately 8,100 people per square mile) when compared to some other large American cities such as [[New York City|New York]] (27,500), [[San Francisco]] (17,000), [[Boston]] (13,300), and [[Chicago]] (11,800).<ref>Haughton, Graham, and Colin Hunter, ''Sustainable Cities'', London: Routledge, 2003: 81.</ref> Densities are particularly high within a 5-mile radius of downtown, where some neighborhoods exceed 20,000 people per square mile.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population Density |url=https://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/population/density/neighborhood/list/ |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> What gives the entire Los Angeles metro region a high density is the fact that many of the city's suburbs and satellites cities have high density rates.<ref>Bruegmann, Robert.

Buildings in the area are low when compared to other large cities, mainly due to zoning regulations. Los Angeles became a major city just as the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] spread population to smaller cities much as interurbans did in East Coast cities. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the area was marked by a network of fairly dense but separate cities linked by rail.

Adjacent areas that are outside the actual city boundaries of incorporated Los Angeles but border the city itself, include the [[Santa Clarita Valley]], the [[San Gabriel Valley]], [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]], and the [[Gateway Cities]].\n\nDespite the large footprint of the city of Los Angeles, a majority of the land area within Los Angeles County is unincorporated and under the primary jurisdiction of Los Angeles County. Much of this land, however, cannot be easily developed due to planning challenges presented by geographic features such as the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], the [[San Gabriel Mountains|San Gabriel Mountains range]], and the [[Mojave Desert]]. Actual land development in these regions occurs on the fringes of incorporated cities, some of which have been fully developed, such as the suburbs of [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]] and [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]].\n\n====Orange County====\n{{main|Orange County, California}}\nOrange County, together with Los Angeles County, is part of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], the inner core of the Greater Los Angeles region. Originally an agricultural area dependent on citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction, Orange County became a [[bedroom community]] for Los Angeles when [[Interstate 5 in California|I\u20135, the Santa Ana Freeway]], linked it to the city in the 1950s. The growth of Los Angeles initially fueled population growth in Orange County, but by the 1970s it had become an important economic center in its own right, with tourism and electronics industries, among others. Today, Orange County is known for its tourist attractions, such as [[Disneyland]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], its several pristine beaches and coastline, and its wealthier areas, featured in television shows such as ''[[The O.C.]]'' No one of the original downtowns serves as the central urban core for the county, but there are important clusters of business and culture in [[Downtown Santa Ana]] and in three [[edge cities]]: the [[Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city]] from [[Disneyland]] to the [[Orange Crush interchange]] ([[Orange, California|Orange]], Santa Ana), the [[South Coast Plaza\u2013John Wayne Airport edge city]] (Santa Ana, [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]), and Irvine's [[Irvine Spectrum Center|Spectrum]] edge city.\n\nOrange County is sometimes figuratively divided into \"North County\" and \"South County\", with North Orange County including cities such as Anaheim, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], and is the older, more ethnically diverse and more densely built-up area closer to Los Angeles. South County, defined variously as beginning with either Costa Mesa<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orangecoastrealestate.com/south-orange-county-real-estate/|title=South Orange County Real Estate foreclosures - South Orange County MLS homes & Condos For sale|website=Orange Coast Real Estate}}</ref> or Irvine<ref>{{cite news |title=Vacanies Are Up in South OC Offices |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33114305/south_oc_definition_la_times/ |accessdate=22 June 2019 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 1, 2001}}</ref> and includes cities to the east and south such as [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]], is more residential, affluent, recently developed, and has a mostly white population. Irvine is an exception, as it is a center of employment and is ethnically diverse. Sometimes the [[Orange Coast]] or South Coast area is defined instead, consisting of some or all of the cities lining the coast.\n\n====Ventura County====\n{{main|Ventura County, California}}\nVentura County is mostly suburban and rural and also has developed primarily through the growth of Los Angeles. The northern part of the county, however, remains largely undeveloped and is mostly within the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. Central and southern Ventura County formerly consisted of small towns along the Pacific Coast until the expansion of [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] drew in commuters from the San Fernando Valley. Master-planned cities soon began developing, and the county became increasingly urbanized.\n\n====Inland Empire====\n{{main|Inland Empire (California)}}\nThe Inland Empire, consisting of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, contains fast-growing suburbs of the region, with a large to majority percentage of the working population commuting to either Los Angeles or Orange Counties for work. Originally an important center for [[citrus production]], the region became an important industrial area by the early 20th century.<ref name=\"citrus\">{{Cite journal | last1= Ruther | first1= Walter | last2= Calavan | first2= E.

It consists of three metropolitan areas in Southern California: the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], the [[Inland Empire]] and the Ventura/Oxnard metropolitan area ([[Ventura County]]).\n\nThroughout the 20th century, it was one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, although growth has slowed since 2000. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] had a population of nearly 13 million residents.

However, this Census definition includes large, sparsely populated and primarily desert swaths of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties that are not part of the urbanized region. The term \"Greater Los Angeles\" does not include [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]; that county's urbanized area is separated from [[San Clemente]], the southernmost contiguous urbanized area south of Los Angeles, by a {{convert|16.4|mile|km|adj=on}} stretch of the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]].\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a total area of {{convert|4850|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us}}, while the wider [[combined statistical area]] covers {{convert|33954|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us}}, making it the largest metropolitan region in the United States by land area. However, more than half of this area lies in the sparsely populated eastern areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

The city was also the first large American city where, in the 1920s, major clusters of regional employment, shopping, and culture were already being built outside the traditional downtown areas \u2013 in [[edge cities]] such as [[Mid-Wilshire]], [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] and [[Hollywood]]. This pattern of growth continued ever outward, more so when the freeway system was built starting in the 1950s; thus Greater Los Angeles was the earliest large American metropolitan area with a [[decentralization|decentralized]] structure. Its major commercial, financial, and cultural institutions are geographically dispersed rather than being concentrated in a single [[downtown]] or central area. Also, the population [[Population density|density]] of [[Los Angeles]] proper is low (approximately 8,100 people per square mile) when compared to some other large American cities such as [[New York City|New York]] (27,500), [[San Francisco]] (17,000), [[Boston]] (13,300), and [[Chicago]] (11,800).<ref>Haughton, Graham, and Colin Hunter, ''Sustainable Cities'', London: Routledge, 2003: 81.</ref> Densities are particularly high within a 5-mile radius of downtown, where some neighborhoods exceed 20,000 people per square mile.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population Density |url=https://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/population/density/neighborhood/list/ |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> What gives the entire Los Angeles metro region a high density is the fact that many of the city's suburbs and satellites cities have high density rates.<ref>Bruegmann, Robert. ''Sprawl: A Compact History''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2005: 65.</ref> Within its urbanized areas, Los Angeles is noted for having small lot sizes and low-rise buildings. Buildings in the area are low when compared to other large cities, mainly due to zoning regulations. Los Angeles became a major city just as the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] spread population to smaller cities much as interurbans did in East Coast cities. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the area was marked by a network of fairly dense but separate cities linked by rail. The ascendance of the [[automobile]] helped fill in the gaps between these commuter towns with lower-density settlements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=New York, Chicago, Los Angeles: America's Global Cities|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8166-3336-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:South-Los-Angeles-110-and-105-freeways-Aerial-view-from-north-August-2014.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Many areas are completely filled with houses, buildings, roads, and freeways as observed here]]\n\nStarting in the early twentieth century, there was a large growth in population on the western edges of the city moving to the [[San Fernando Valley]] and out into the [[Conejo Valley]] in eastern [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].

New York: Columbia University Press, 2003: 94.</ref> As a result, there was a large growth in population into the Conejo Valley and into Ventura County through the [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|US 101]] corridor. Making the US 101 a full [[freeway]] in the 1960s and expansions that followed helped make [[commuting]] to Los Angeles easier and opened the way for development westward. Development in Ventura County and along the US 101 corridor remains controversial, with open-space advocates battling those who feel business development is necessary to economic growth.<ref>Curtiss, Aaron. \"Bitter Land-Use Fights Seen For 101 Corridor Development.\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' November 20, 1993: B1.</ref> Although the area still has abundant amount of open space and land, almost all of it was put aside and mandated never to be developed as part of the master plan of each city.

For example, while Los Angeles County and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] together make up the smaller MSA region, the two have a host of sharp demographic, political, and financial distinctions.

Originally an agricultural area dependent on citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction, Orange County became a [[bedroom community]] for Los Angeles when [[Interstate 5 in California|I\u20135, the Santa Ana Freeway]], linked it to the city in the 1950s. The growth of Los Angeles initially fueled population growth in Orange County, but by the 1970s it had become an important economic center in its own right, with tourism and electronics industries, among others. Today, Orange County is known for its tourist attractions, such as [[Disneyland]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], its several pristine beaches and coastline, and its wealthier areas, featured in television shows such as ''[[The O.C.]]'' No one of the original downtowns serves as the central urban core for the county, but there are important clusters of business and culture in [[Downtown Santa Ana]] and in three [[edge cities]]: the [[Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city]] from [[Disneyland]] to the [[Orange Crush interchange]] ([[Orange, California|Orange]], Santa Ana), the [[South Coast Plaza\u2013John Wayne Airport edge city]] (Santa Ana, [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]), and Irvine's [[Irvine Spectrum Center|Spectrum]] edge city.\n\nOrange County is sometimes figuratively divided into \"North County\" and \"South County\", with North Orange County including cities such as Anaheim, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], and is the older, more ethnically diverse and more densely built-up area closer to Los Angeles. South County, defined variously as beginning with either Costa Mesa<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orangecoastrealestate.com/south-orange-county-real-estate/|title=South Orange County Real Estate foreclosures - South Orange County MLS homes & Condos For sale|website=Orange Coast Real Estate}}</ref> or Irvine<ref>{{cite news |title=Vacanies Are Up in South OC Offices |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33114305/south_oc_definition_la_times/ |accessdate=22 June 2019 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 1, 2001}}</ref> and includes cities to the east and south such as [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]], is more residential, affluent, recently developed, and has a mostly white population. Irvine is an exception, as it is a center of employment and is ethnically diverse. Sometimes the [[Orange Coast]] or South Coast area is defined instead, consisting of some or all of the cities lining the coast.\n\n====Ventura County====\n{{main|Ventura County, California}}\nVentura County is mostly suburban and rural and also has developed primarily through the growth of Los Angeles. The northern part of the county, however, remains largely undeveloped and is mostly within the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. Central and southern Ventura County formerly consisted of small towns along the Pacific Coast until the expansion of [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] drew in commuters from the San Fernando Valley. Master-planned cities soon began developing, and the county became increasingly urbanized.\n\n====Inland Empire====\n{{main|Inland Empire (California)}}\nThe Inland Empire, consisting of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, contains fast-growing suburbs of the region, with a large to majority percentage of the working population commuting to either Los Angeles or Orange Counties for work. Originally an important center for [[citrus production]], the region became an important industrial area by the early 20th century.<ref name=\"citrus\">{{Cite journal | last1= Ruther | first1= Walter | last2= Calavan | first2= E.

With the post-World War II economic boom leading to rapid development in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, land developers bulldozed acres of agricultural land to build suburbs in order to accommodate the Los Angeles area's expanding population.<ref name=\"citrus\" /> The development of a regional [[Southern California freeways|freeway system]] facilitated the expansion of suburbs and human migration linking the Inland Empire and rest of Greater Los Angeles. Despite being primarily suburban, the Inland Empire is also home to important warehousing, shipping, logistics and retail industries, centered on the subregion's major cities of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].\n\nWhile the Inland Empire is sometimes defined as the entirety of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, the eastern undeveloped, desert portions of these counties are not considered to be part of Greater Los Angeles. The state of California defines this area to include the cities of [[Adelanto, California|Adelanto]], [[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]], and [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] to the north, the Riverside\u2013San Diego county line to the south, and the towns of [[Anza, California|Anza]], [[Idyllwild, California|Idyllwild]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]], along with the [[San Bernardino National Forest]] to the east.<ref>[http://www.visitcalifornia.com/media/pages/getting_around/maps/INLAND-EMPIRE.pdf State of California map of Inland Empire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814024123/http://www.visitcalifornia.com/media/pages/getting_around/maps/INLAND-EMPIRE.pdf |date=August 14, 2012 }}</ref> However, with clear northern and southern limits to expansion, the region's urban eastern boundaries have become increasingly nebulous as [[suburban sprawl]] continues to spread out to form a unified whole with Los Angeles, with further development encroaching past the [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains]] and into the outlying desert areas. As a result, the regional definition of Greater Los Angeles can now be extended to include [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] and surrounding towns in the northeast, the [[Morongo Basin]] in the east-central including [[Yucca Valley, CA|Yucca Valley]] and [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]], and the [[Coachella Valley]] cities in the southeast.
