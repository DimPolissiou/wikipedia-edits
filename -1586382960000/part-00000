Sutton (sometimes spelled \"Elliott\" and frequently abbreviated E. M. Sutton) was born in [[Oxford, Connecticut]] on October 13, 1841.{{sfn|\"Death of E. M.

''Libro de hexaedros'' served as the foundation for the creation of ''El cubo de los cambios'', a piece of stochastic poetry which, again, was the result of a creative collaboration with Arnaldo Coen.\n\nHe ventured as well upon visual poetry and theater. He is the author of the dramatic poems: ''La rosa de Ariadna'',<ref>\u00ab[http://www.petals.org/Petal006-english.html La rosa de Ariadna]\".

His poems have been translated into English, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Flemish, Swedish and Japanese. He is the author of various anthologies of Mexican and Latin American poetry and several books for children. He has also contributed to the enrichment of the Spanish language having penned literary translations of poetry first written by the Proven\u00e7al troubadours, the ''[[Carmina Burana]]s'', the ''[[Book of Job]]'' and various other works of mainly French and English poets.

He studied [[political science]] and filmmaking at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and [[French literature]] at the [[Sorbonne University]] in Paris. He was a poetry scholarship recipient from the ''[[Centro Mexicano de Escritores]]'' and from the ''[[Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte]]''.<ref name=\"inba\">[http://www.literatura.inba.gob.mx/literaturainba/diccionarios/diccionario_more.php?id=307_0_2_0_M10 Serrano, Francisco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225310/http://www.literatura.inba.gob.mx/literaturainba/diccionarios/diccionario_more.php?id=307_0_2_0_M10 |date=July 22, 2011 }}.

A disciple of [[Octavio Paz]], Serrano experimented with the use of random processes in poetic composition. In 1980, in collaboration with painter [[Arnaldo Coen]] and composer [[Mario Lavista]], he was a co-creator of ''Mutaciones, Jaula, In/cubaciones'', a piece of work combining design, music and poetry conceived as a tribute to American composer [[John Cage]].<ref>Debroise,Olivier (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=So-i03PG1xQC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=%22Francisco+Serrano%22+%2B+poeta&source=bl&ots=uIrjwEwDWn&sig=BX7aQDczIQYKb7nqAwmPhtA-yMo&hl=en&ei=LBdrTZDKLYbGlQeaz4H_AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Francisco%20Serrano%22%20%20%20poeta&f=false La era de la discrepancia: arte y cultura visual en M\u00e9xico, 1968\u20131997] UNAM. {{ISBN|978-970-32-3829-3}}</ref> In 1982, Serrano published ''Libro de hexaedros'', a collection of sixty-four poems that together, reinterprets and synthesizes images and processes described in the hexagrams of the ''[[I Ching]]''.  ''Libro de hexaedros'' served as the foundation for the creation of ''El cubo de los cambios'', a piece of stochastic poetry which, again, was the result of a creative collaboration with Arnaldo Coen.\n\nHe ventured as well upon visual poetry and theater. He is the author of the dramatic poems: ''La rosa de Ariadna'',<ref>\u00ab[http://www.petals.org/Petal006-english.html La rosa de Ariadna]\". Petals.org.</ref> used as the libretto in the opera of the same name written by Italian composer [[Gualtiero Dazzi]], and which premiered in 1995 at the ''Musica'' Festival in [[Strasbourg]], France; and ''En susurros los muertos'', a musical, also with G. Dazzi, first presented at the ''M\u00fasica y Escena'' Festival in [[Mexico]] in 2005.\n\nSerrano is the co-author of several books with Mexican painters [[Manuel Felgu\u00e9rez]], [[Vicente Rojo Almaz\u00e1n|Vicente Rojo]], [[Gabriel Macotela]] and [[Roberto Cort\u00e1zar]]. He has published thirteen titles of poetry, including ''No es sino el azar'' (1984), ''Confianza en la materia'' (1997), ''M\u00fasica de la lengua'' (1999), ''Aqu\u00ed es ninguna parte'' (2000), ''Prosa del Popocat\u00e9petl'' (2005) and ''Cuenta de mis muertos'' (2006). His poems have been translated into English, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Flemish, Swedish and Japanese. He is the author of various anthologies of Mexican and Latin American poetry and several books for children. He has also contributed to the enrichment of the Spanish language having penned literary translations of poetry first written by the Proven\u00e7al troubadours, the ''[[Carmina Burana]]s'', the ''[[Book of Job]]'' and various other works of mainly French and English poets.
