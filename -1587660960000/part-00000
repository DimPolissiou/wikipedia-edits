In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study ''On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries'', which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:<ref>{{Cite journal|url =https://archive.org/details/onsomedeficienci00trenrich |title = On Some Deficiencies in Our English Dictionaries|last = Trench|first = Richard Chenevix|date = 1857|journal = Transactions of the Philological Society|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 9|pages = 3\u20138}}</ref>\n* Incomplete coverage of obsolete words\n* Inconsistent coverage of families of related words\n* Incorrect dates for earliest use of words\n* History of obsolete senses of words often omitted\n* Inadequate distinction among [[synonyms]]\n* Insufficient use of good illustrative quotations\n* Space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content.\n\nThe society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly ''comprehensive'' dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|107\u20138}} Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips.

His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.<ref name=Mugglestone/>{{Rp|9}} In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of [[tuberculosis]], aged 30.<ref name=Craigie/>{{Rp|x}}\n\nThereupon Furnivall became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|110}} Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.\n\nFurnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the [[Early English Text Society]] in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.<ref name=Craigie/>{{Rp|xii}} Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/page/reading/Reading$0020Programme|title = Reading Programme|date = |accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both [[Henry Sweet]] and [[Henry Nicol]] to succeed him. He then approached [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|111\u20132}} 20 years after its conception, the dictionary project finally had a publisher. It would take another 50 years to complete.\n\nLate in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named [[William Chester Minor|W. C. Minor]] was a criminal lunatic.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|xiii}}  Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the [[American Civil War]], and was confined to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane]] after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]'' (US title: ''The Professor and the Madman''<ref name=Winchester1999/>), a popular book about the creation of the ''OED''. This book was then the basis for the 2019 film ''[[The Professor and the Madman (film)|The Professor and the Madman]]'', starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Sean Penn]].\n\n===Oxford editors===\n[[File:James-Murray.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] in the Scriptorium at Banbury Road]]\n\nDuring the 1870s, the [[Philological Society]] was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.<ref name=Dickson/> They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[Oxford University Press]] were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the [[Philological Society]] president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages.

Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.<ref name=Mugglestone/>{{rp|32\u201333}} The first was that he move from [[Mill Hill]] to [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], which he did in 1885.

Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and [[Philip Lyttelton Gell|Philip Gell]] of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant [[Henry Bradley]] (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the [[British Museum]] in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.<ref name=Mugglestone/>\n\nGell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns\u2014containing costs and speeding production\u2014to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', and public opinion backed the editors.<ref name=Winchester2003/>{{rp|182\u201383}} Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.\n\nNeither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with ''A\u2013D'', ''H\u2013K'', ''O\u2013P'', and ''T'', nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed ''E\u2013G'', ''L\u2013M'', ''S\u2013Sh'', ''St'', and ''W\u2013We''. By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble.

However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.<ref name=Supplement1957-1986/>\n\nThere were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and [[typesetting|retypeset]], with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.\n\n[[Robert Burchfield]] was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement;<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Revolution in English Lexicography|last = Simpson|first = John|date = 2002|journal = Dictionaries: Journal of the Dictionary Society of North America|doi = 10.1353/dic.2002.0004|volume = 23|pages = 1\u201315}}</ref> [[Charles Talbut Onions|Onions]] turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well.

Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom]], including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean.

For the suffix more commonly spelt <!-- spelt: British spelling of participle --> ''-ise'' in British English, [[OUP]] policy dictates a preference for the spelling ''-ize'', e.g., ''realize'' vs. ''realise'' and ''globalization'' vs. ''globalisation''. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix ''-\u03b9\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd'', (''-izein''), or the Latin ''-iz\u0101re''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100447|title = -ize, suffix|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |url-access=subscription }}</ref> However, ''-ze'' is also sometimes treated as an [[American English#Morphology|Americanism]] insofar as the ''-ze'' suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with ''analyse'' (British English), which is spelt ''analyze'' in American English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=get |title=Verbs ending in -ize, -ise, -yze, and -yse : Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref><ref>See also ''-ise/-ize'' at [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|American and British English spelling differences]].</ref><!--Since 2006, the online OED version does not include the ''-ise'' variant spellings in the entry headwords, illustrating the editorial favouring of the ''-ize'' suffix.-->\n\n==Reception==\nBritish prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] described the ''OED'' as a \"national treasure\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f90b88dc-462f-11e2-b780-00144feabdc0.html|title=Well-chosen words|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-03}}</ref> Author [[Anu Garg]], founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a \"lex icon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/article-globeandmail.html |title=Globe & Mail|publisher=Wordsmith|date =11 February 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> [[Tim Bray]], co-creator of Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]), credits the ''OED'' as the developing inspiration of that [[markup language]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/09/SemanticMarkup|title = On Semantics and Markup|date = 9 April 2003|accessdate = 4 June 2014|website = ongoing by Tim Bray|publisher = |last = Bray|first = Tim}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority,<ref name=\"OED.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/public/oedhistory |format= |publisher= |title=History of the OED |accessdate=18 February 2012|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online}}</ref> the dictionary has been criticized since at least the 1960s from various angles.

The ''OED'', as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of RW Burchfield A Supplement to the OED Volume 3: O\u2013Scz|last = Harris|first = Roy|date = 1982|journal = TLS|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 3|pages = 935\u20136}}</ref> University of Oxford linguist [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]] writes that criticizing the ''OED'' is extremely difficult because \"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\", one that \"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \"literary\" authors such as [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \"respectable\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the ''OED''<nowiki/>'s \"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\", faulting the dictionary's [[prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]] rather than [[descriptive grammar|descriptive]] usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \"''erroneous''\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \"social bias[es]\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \"erroneous and catachrestic\" usages is being removed from third edition entries,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/key-to-symbols-and-other-conventions/|last = Oxford University Press|title = Key to symbols and other conventional entries|website=Oxford English Dictionary online |date=2017 |accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109061#eid195210375|title = literally, adv.

However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' obscenity trial]] in 1960.

In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study ''On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries'', which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:<ref>{{Cite journal|url =https://archive.org/details/onsomedeficienci00trenrich |title = On Some Deficiencies in Our English Dictionaries|last = Trench|first = Richard Chenevix|date = 1857|journal = Transactions of the Philological Society|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 9|pages = 3\u20138}}</ref>\n* Incomplete coverage of obsolete words\n* Inconsistent coverage of families of related words\n* Incorrect dates for earliest use of words\n* History of obsolete senses of words often omitted\n* Inadequate distinction among [[synonyms]]\n* Insufficient use of good illustrative quotations\n* Space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content.\n\nThe society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly ''comprehensive'' dictionary was needed.

His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.<ref name=Mugglestone/>{{Rp|9}} In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of [[tuberculosis]], aged 30.<ref name=Craigie/>{{Rp|x}}\n\nThereupon Furnivall became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|110}} Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.\n\nFurnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the [[Early English Text Society]] in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.<ref name=Craigie/>{{Rp|xii}} Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/page/reading/Reading$0020Programme|title = Reading Programme|date = |accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both [[Henry Sweet]] and [[Henry Nicol]] to succeed him. He then approached [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|111\u20132}} 20 years after its conception, the dictionary project finally had a publisher. It would take another 50 years to complete.\n\nLate in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named [[William Chester Minor|W. C. Minor]] was a criminal lunatic.<ref name=Winchester1999/>{{rp|xiii}}  Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the [[American Civil War]], and was confined to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane]] after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]'' (US title: ''The Professor and the Madman''<ref name=Winchester1999/>), a popular book about the creation of the ''OED''. This book was then the basis for the 2019 film ''[[The Professor and the Madman (film)|The Professor and the Madman]]'', starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Sean Penn]].\n\n===Oxford editors===\n[[File:James-Murray.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] in the Scriptorium at Banbury Road]]\n\nDuring the 1870s, the [[Philological Society]] was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.<ref name=Dickson/> They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[Oxford University Press]] were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the [[Philological Society]] president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages.

Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and [[Philip Lyttelton Gell|Philip Gell]] of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant [[Henry Bradley]] (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the [[British Museum]] in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.<ref name=Mugglestone/>\n\nGell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns\u2014containing costs and speeding production\u2014to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely.

If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.\n\nNeither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with ''A\u2013D'', ''H\u2013K'', ''O\u2013P'', and ''T'', nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed ''E\u2013G'', ''L\u2013M'', ''S\u2013Sh'', ''St'', and ''W\u2013We''.

Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom]], including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean.

The original edition, mostly based on the ''OED1'', was edited by [[Francis George Fowler]] and [[Henry Watson Fowler]] and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary: The Classic First Edition|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-19-969612-3 |postscript=, facsimile reprint.}}</ref> Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.\n\n''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise.  Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.<ref>Thompson, Della. ''[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.545900 The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English]'', 8th Edition. Oxford University Press. 1996. {{ISBN|978-0198600459}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1998 the ''[[New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' (''NODE'') was published. While also aiming to cover current English, ''NODE'' was not based on the ''OED''. Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of [[corpus linguistics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/reviews/re-oed1.htm |title = Review: Oxford Dictionary of English |date = 18 September 2010 |accessdate = 29 July 2014 |website = World Wide Words |publisher = |last = Quinion|first = Michael}}</ref> Once ''NODE'' was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' followed, this time based on an abridgement of ''NODE'' rather than the ''OED''; ''NODE'' (under the new title of the ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', or ''ODE'') continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', with the ''OED'' now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.\n\n==Spelling==\n{{Main|Oxford spelling}}\nThe ''OED'' lists British headword spellings (e.g., ''labour'', ''centre'') with variants following (''labor'', ''center'', etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt <!-- spelt: British spelling of participle --> ''-ise'' in British English, [[OUP]] policy dictates a preference for the spelling ''-ize'', e.g., ''realize'' vs. ''realise'' and ''globalization'' vs. ''globalisation''. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix ''-\u03b9\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd'', (''-izein''), or the Latin ''-iz\u0101re''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100447|title = -ize, suffix|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |url-access=subscription }}</ref> However, ''-ze'' is also sometimes treated as an [[American English#Morphology|Americanism]] insofar as the ''-ze'' suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with ''analyse'' (British English), which is spelt ''analyze'' in American English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=get |title=Verbs ending in -ize, -ise, -yze, and -yse : Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref><ref>See also ''-ise/-ize'' at [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|American and British English spelling differences]].</ref><!--Since 2006, the online OED version does not include the ''-ise'' variant spellings in the entry headwords, illustrating the editorial favouring of the ''-ize'' suffix.-->\n\n==Reception==\nBritish prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] described the ''OED'' as a \"national treasure\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f90b88dc-462f-11e2-b780-00144feabdc0.html|title=Well-chosen words|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-03}}</ref> Author [[Anu Garg]], founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a \"lex icon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/article-globeandmail.html |title=Globe & Mail|publisher=Wordsmith|date =11 February 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> [[Tim Bray]], co-creator of Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]), credits the ''OED'' as the developing inspiration of that [[markup language]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/09/SemanticMarkup|title = On Semantics and Markup|date = 9 April 2003|accessdate = 4 June 2014|website = ongoing by Tim Bray|publisher = |last = Bray|first = Tim}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority,<ref name=\"OED.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/public/oedhistory |format= |publisher= |title=History of the OED |accessdate=18 February 2012|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online}}</ref> the dictionary has been criticized since at least the 1960s from various angles.

The ''OED'', as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of RW Burchfield A Supplement to the OED Volume 3: O\u2013Scz|last = Harris|first = Roy|date = 1982|journal = TLS|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 3|pages = 935\u20136}}</ref> University of Oxford linguist [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]] writes that criticizing the ''OED'' is extremely difficult because \"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\", one that \"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \"literary\" authors such as [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \"respectable\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the ''OED''<nowiki/>'s \"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\", faulting the dictionary's [[prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]] rather than [[descriptive grammar|descriptive]] usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \"''erroneous''\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \"social bias[es]\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \"erroneous and catachrestic\" usages is being removed from third edition entries,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/key-to-symbols-and-other-conventions/|last = Oxford University Press|title = Key to symbols and other conventional entries|website=Oxford English Dictionary online |date=2017 |accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109061#eid195210375|title = literally, adv.

However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' obscenity trial]] in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word ''fuck'' was the ''[[Penguin English Dictionary]]'' of 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/75197|title = fuck, v.|date = March 2008|accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |url-access=subscription }}</ref> [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]]'s ''English Dialect Dictionary'' had included ''[[shit]]'' in 1905.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/englishdialectdi05wrig|title=The English dialect dictionary, being the complete vocabulary of all dialect words still in use, or known to have been in use during the last two hundred years;|first=Joseph|last=Wright|date=1 February 1898|publisher=London [etc.] : H.

Putnam's Sons|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe ''OED''{{'}}s claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex2012/pp834-845%20ten%20Hacken.pdf|title = In what sense is the OED the definitive record of the English language?|last = ten Hacken|first = Pius|date = 2012|journal = Proceedings of the 15th EURALEX International Congress|accessdate = 28 July 2014|doi = |pages = 834\u2013845}}</ref>\n\nFounding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word \"radium\" to the dictionary.<ref>Gross, John, ''The Oxford Book of Parodies'', Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 319</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Canadian Oxford

Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off.

The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904.

In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water.

Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built.

They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx.

On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay.

It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811,<ref name=Clements /> at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n==== Jersey ====\n[[File:Tou d'V\u00eende, J\u00e8rri 2.jpg|thumb|La Tour de Vinde, [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]], Jersey]]\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in [[Jersey]], three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Icho Tower]] (1811)\n* [[Portelet Tower]] (1808)\n* [[La Tour de Vinde]] (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)<ref name=Grimsley>Grimsley (1988), p.43.</ref>\nThe four surviving, later towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Lewis Tower, Jersey|Lewis Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\n* [[Kempt Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\n* [[La Collette Tower]] \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\n* [[Victoria Tower, Jersey|Victoria Tower]] (1837)\n\nIn addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the [[Jersey Round Tower]]s), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos.

However, [[Madliena Tower]], which was one of thirteen [[De Redin towers]] built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Madliena Tower \u2013 Malta's 'Martello' Tower|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=11 August 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019035044/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie.

The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.<ref>Brock & Brock (1976), p.162.</ref>\n\nThat said, [[Vice Admiral]] [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of [[Menorca]], Sir [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]], the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.<ref name=Grundy />\n\nThe British built five towers to protect [[Mah\u00f3n]]: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower.

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair.

Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off.

The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904.

In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water.

Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built.

They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx.

On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of [[Magilligan|Magilligan Point]] in [[County Londonderry]], built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; it is now currently used as a visitor attraction. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://discovernorthernireland.com/Magilligan-Martello-Tower-Limavady-P2926/ |title=Magilligan Martello Tower\n |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=discovernorthernireland.com |publisher= Discover Northern Ireland |access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\nA Martello-like tower was built on [[Achill Island]], according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay.

It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811,<ref name=Clements /> at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n==== Jersey ====\n[[File:Tou d'V\u00eende, J\u00e8rri 2.jpg|thumb|La Tour de Vinde, [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]], Jersey]]\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in [[Jersey]], three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Icho Tower]] (1811)\n* [[Portelet Tower]] (1808)\n* [[La Tour de Vinde]] (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)<ref name=Grimsley>Grimsley (1988), p.43.</ref>\nThe four surviving, later towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Lewis Tower, Jersey|Lewis Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\n* [[Kempt Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\n* [[La Collette Tower]] \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\n* [[Victoria Tower, Jersey|Victoria Tower]] (1837)\n\nIn addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the [[Jersey Round Tower]]s), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos.

However, [[Madliena Tower]], which was one of thirteen [[De Redin towers]] built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Madliena Tower \u2013 Malta's 'Martello' Tower|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=11 August 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019035044/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie.

The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.<ref>Brock & Brock (1976), p.162.</ref>\n\nThat said, [[Vice Admiral]] [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of [[Menorca]], Sir [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]], the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.<ref name=Grundy />\n\nThe British built five towers to protect [[Mah\u00f3n]]: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower.

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair.

It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases.

This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran.

It is located near [[Al Waleed (town)|Al Walid]] town close to the [[Baghdad\u2013Amman highway]] in the [[Al Anbar]] desert west of Iraq, near the Jordanian border and 1000&nbsp;km from the Iranian borders. It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases.

This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique.

Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows planning the route. <ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA197&dq=canting+keel|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Systems ==\n[[File:Temenos (4).JPG|thumb|Cockpit of racing yacht, ''Temenos'', in 2006]]\nOnboard systems include:<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n* Electrical power, provided by batteries recharged by a motor-driven alternator\n* Water, stored in on-board tanks, refilled on shore or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]]\n* Sanitation, provided by toilets using seawater and discharged into holding tanks.\n* Refrigeration by ice or an engine-driven mechanical system.\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n==Sailing yachts==\n[[File:Hunter 25 September Song 0878.jpg|thumb|Small sailing yacht with [[outboard motor]] in 2017]]\n{{Main|Sailing yacht}}\nCruising and racing yachts embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance.

More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].
