At the time, the idea of preserving an old warehouse was a bizarre concept. Diamond had borrowed money and renovated the building and live in one of the floors.

It is important for him to make buildings relate to their location as well as reflect the users of the building. To Diamond, buildings with a loud presence were more difficult to be compatible in their surroundings. He believes that it is important for a building to be part of the city its located in. Not every building needs to be a defining landmark.<ref name=\":3\" />  \n\n== Notable Projects ==\n\n=== Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts ===\nThe Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts opened in 2006. It is home to the [[Canadian Opera Company]] and the [[National Ballet of Canada]]. The Performing Arts Centre design keeps the city noise of Toronto out. The performance sounds are also well contained inside. The surrounding context allows for the building to engage with the streetscape. The Glass exterior on the corner of Queen st. and University st. allows for views inside and out, creating an animated experience for those inside and out. The corner lights up at night and allows for a lantern like effect. The Theater is building near the subway line so acoustics clarity is important. The Theater sits on a double layer of concrete with more than 500 high performance rubber pads. The stages, auditorium, and rehearsal hall are a separate structure from the rest of the building. This allows for stronger noise control. The Theater contrasts privacy of the closed auditorium with the transparency of glass in the public gathering spaces. The Theater is known to excel expectations and help deliver high quality performances. \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/four-seasons-centre-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts|date=2019-05-31|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Competition ===\nThe United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial was a international design competition. The Memorial opened in 2017. Located in Victoria Tower Gardens, the Memorial represents honor to the victims and survivors from the Holocaust. The entrance of the Memorial is a ramp that circles around the middle. The cast-iron walls are a darker material are a reminder of the events that took place in the Holocaust. The sunken middle opens up to the sky to bring lightness into the memorial and contrast to the darker walls. The middle of the Memorial is the 'Court of Conscience'. The names of the victims are the only sounds heard within the quiet memorial. The Holocaust Memorial is a place of reflection to honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust from the Second World War. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/united-kingdom-holocaust-memorial-competition/|title=United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Competition|date=2019-06-18|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Mariinsky II ===\nThe Marinsky II opened in 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia. This theater was one of the first major Russia opera houses to be constructed in over a century. Acoustic quality and the experience of a performance were two main goals when designing the Mariinsky II. The main auditorium of the theater is clad in Onyx. The warm glow from the Onyx can be seen at street level outside. The warm glow is considered to be the artistic spirit from art institutions in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/mariinsky-ii/|title=Mariinsky II|date=2019-02-07|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The backstage is designed to allow for 5 stages to be worked on simultaneously, making it easier for crews working on productions.

At the time, the idea of preserving an old warehouse was a bizarre concept. Diamond had borrowed money and renovated the building and live in one of the floors. The project was successful and other individuals showed interest. The old warehouse went under renovation and is later sold to [[Ed Mirvish]]. Diamond is a known pioneer in Toronto's heritage restoration. <ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2014/10/17/a_drink_with_architect_jack_diamond.html|title=A drink with architect Jack Diamond|date=2014-10-17|website=thestar.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Diamond established his practice A.J Diamond Architects.

It is important for him to make buildings relate to their location as well as reflect the users of the building. To Diamond, buildings with a loud presence were more difficult to be compatible in their surroundings. He believes that it is important for a building to be part of the city its located in. Not every building needs to be a defining landmark.  \n\n== Notable Projects ==\n\n=== Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts ===\nThe Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts opened in 2006. It is home to the [[Canadian Opera Company]] and the [[National Ballet of Canada]]. The Performing Arts Centre design keeps the city noise of Toronto out. The performance sounds are also well contained inside. The surrounding context allows for the building to engage with the streetscape. The Glass exterior on the corner of Queen st. and University st. allows for views inside and out, creating an animated experience for those inside and out. The corner lights up at night and allows for a lantern like effect. The Theater is building near the subway line so acoustics clarity is important. The Theater sits on a double layer of concrete with more than 500 high performance rubber pads. The stages, auditorium, and rehearsal hall are a separate structure from the rest of the building. This allows for stronger noise control. The Theater contrasts privacy of the closed auditorium with the transparency of glass in the public gathering spaces. The Theater is known to excel expectations and help deliver high quality performances. \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/four-seasons-centre-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts|date=2019-05-31|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Competition ===\nThe United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial was a international design competition. The Memorial opened in 2017. Located in Victoria Tower Gardens, the Memorial represents honor to the victims and survivors from the Holocaust. The entrance of the Memorial is a ramp that circles around the middle. The cast-iron walls are a darker material are a reminder of the events that took place in the Holocaust. The sunken middle opens up to the sky to bring lightness into the memorial and contrast to the darker walls. The middle of the Memorial is the 'Court of Conscience'. The names of the victims are the only sounds heard within the quiet memorial. The Holocaust Memorial is a place of reflection to honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust from the Second World War. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/united-kingdom-holocaust-memorial-competition/|title=United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Competition|date=2019-06-18|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Mariinsky II ===\nThe Marinsky II opened in 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia. This theater was one of the first major Russia opera houses to be constructed in over a century. Acoustic quality and the experience of a performance were two main goals when designing the Mariinsky II. The main auditorium of the theater is clad in Onyx. The warm glow from the Onyx can be seen at street level outside. The warm glow is considered to be the artistic spirit from art institutions in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsai.ca/projects/mariinsky-ii/|title=Mariinsky II|date=2019-02-07|website=Diamond Schmitt|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The backstage is designed to allow for 5 stages to be worked on simultaneously, making it easier for crews working on productions.
