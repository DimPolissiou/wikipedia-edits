They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.\n\n=== Running ===\nThe Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or \"the Hunt\") is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Roger|date=December 1998|title=On the Scent of History|journal=Running Times|page=28}}</ref> The sport of \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", now known as a [[Paper Chase (game)|Paper Chase]], was formalised at the school around 1800.

They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps.

It was opened in 1834.\n\nAs built, the line ran west/east between two termini, [[Leeds Marsh Lane railway station|Marsh Lane station, Leeds]] and [[Selby railway station]]. The company was leased and then acquired by the [[York and North Midland Railway]] in 1840 and 1844; the line remained in use through the subsequent [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|NER]], [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]], [[British Rail|BR]] and [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date|post-privatisation]] periods.\n\nUse of the line was expanded through junction connections to new railways, most built in the late 19th century; a junction with the [[York and North Midland Railway]] in 1839; an end on junction at Selby to Hull ([[Hull and Selby Railway]], 1840); a through route into Leeds and westward (Leeds viaduct extension, 1869); a shortened route to York (Micklefield to Church Fenton, 1869); a line to [[Wetherby]] ([[Cross Gates to Wetherby Line]], 1876, closed 1964); a line to [[Castleford]] ([[Garforth to Castleford Line]], 1878, closed 1969) and a line avoiding Selby for Goole ([[Selby to Goole Line]], 1910, closed 1964) as well as a number of minor and industrial lines and sidings. The [[Selby Diversion]] of the [[East Coast Main Line]] (1983) also made junctions with the Leeds and Selby.\n\nAs of 2014, the line is still in mainline use and use for services operated by [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] for services from Leeds to Selby, Hull, York and beyond.\n\n== The Leeds and Selby Railway Company (1830\u20131844) ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|History of Leeds}}\nBy 1830 Leeds had long been an important town, having become prosperous initially through the manufacture of woollen cloth.

He expected that the additional cost of their construction would be offset by use of the stone elsewhere on the railway and by its sale. The railway would also be of use for the transportation of coal and stone from quarries and mines near the line, such as the Huddlestone quarry. Additionally he suggested that the route of the railway could also be used for the piping of clean water to Leeds. As to the route of the railway, he suggested resiting the Leeds terminus at cheaper and less-developed land around Marsh Lane instead of at Far Bank. The resurveyed line was also deviated to the north away from the river bank, to avoid the objections of the Aire and Calder Undertakers; the more northern path would require passing Richmond Hill requiring either stationary engines or a tunnel; Walker recommended the latter. Outside Leeds, minor deviations were made in order for the line to cross the north\u2013south [[turnpike trust|turnpikes]] using bridges. At Selby, the new plan sited the station further south than the original, which had been sited next to the road bridge, with the intention of crossing the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] by widening this bridge; with the line no longer going to Hull but terminating at Selby a site with more space for wharves and jetties was required. He recommended a double track line, with sufficient land acquired for a four track line.<ref>James Walker's report: \"To the Committee of the proposed Leeds and Selby Railway Company\", 18 July 1829, reprinted in full in {{harvnb|MacTurk|1879|pp=18\u201332}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the line was to be built on land belonging to the shareholders, including [[Edward Robert Petre]] who owned land in Selby, and Richard Oliver Gascoigne (who later had built the Aberford Railway).

The [[Selby Diversion]] of the [[East Coast Main Line]] (1983) also made junctions with the Leeds and Selby.\n\nAs of 2014, the line is still in mainline use and use for services operated by [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] for services from Leeds to Selby, Hull, York and beyond.\n\n== The Leeds and Selby Railway Company (1830\u20131844) ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|History of Leeds}}\nBy 1830 Leeds had long been an important town, having become prosperous initially through the manufacture of woollen cloth.

The shareholders passed the proposal at a general meeting in Leeds on 20 March 1829, and the '''Leeds and Selby Railway Company''' was formed.<ref name=\"t202\"/>\n\n=== Formation of the Leeds and Selby Railway Company ===\n{{Leeds and Selby Railway, 1834}}\nThe Leeds and Hull railway scheme of 1824 was revived as a shortened line from Leeds to Selby and was resurveyed by [[James Walker (engineer)|James Walker]] in 1829;{{sfn|Hoole|1986|p=29}} [[Benjamin Gott]], one of the line's promoters and a wool and cloth magnate thought the inclined planes would be a disadvantage.<ref name=\"gg\"/>\n\nJames Walker reported that the stationary engines could be abandoned, and tunnels and cuttings built in their place. He expected that the additional cost of their construction would be offset by use of the stone elsewhere on the railway and by its sale. The railway would also be of use for the transportation of coal and stone from quarries and mines near the line, such as the Huddlestone quarry. Additionally he suggested that the route of the railway could also be used for the piping of clean water to Leeds. As to the route of the railway, he suggested resiting the Leeds terminus at cheaper and less-developed land around Marsh Lane instead of at Far Bank. The resurveyed line was also deviated to the north away from the river bank, to avoid the objections of the Aire and Calder Undertakers; the more northern path would require passing Richmond Hill requiring either stationary engines or a tunnel; Walker recommended the latter. Outside Leeds, minor deviations were made in order for the line to cross the north\u2013south [[turnpike trust|turnpikes]] using bridges. At Selby, the new plan sited the station further south than the original, which had been sited next to the road bridge, with the intention of crossing the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] by widening this bridge; with the line no longer going to Hull but terminating at Selby a site with more space for wharves and jetties was required. He recommended a double track line, with sufficient land acquired for a four track line.<ref>James Walker's report: \"To the Committee of the proposed Leeds and Selby Railway Company\", 18 July 1829, reprinted in full in {{harvnb|MacTurk|1879|pp=18\u201332}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the line was to be built on land belonging to the shareholders, including [[Edward Robert Petre]] who owned land in Selby, and Richard Oliver Gascoigne (who later had built the Aberford Railway).

The film was an official entry to the [[Metro Manila Film Festival|1998 Metro Manila Film Festival]]. Upon release, the film met universal acclaim for Cesar's acting, Abaya's direction, screenplay and historical events. It is considered as one of the best Filipino films of 1990s.\n\n==Plot==\nJos\u00e9 Rizal was imprisoned in [[Fort Santiago]] under the abusive [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]]. Meanwhile, in Balintawak, [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his fellow secret organization, the [[Katipunan]], commenced the uprising against the tyranny created by the [[Spaniards]] by tearing their cedulas as a sign of freedom from the Spanish slavery.\n\nSoon, a first lieutenant of the Artillery, Luis Taviel de Andrade, visits Rizal. Taviel de Andrade did not waste time to study carefully Rizal's case. In just a short period of time, Rizal and Taviel captured each other's sympathy and eventually became friends as they had usual meetings in Rizal's cell in [[Fort Santiago]]. Taviel was even able to celebrate [[Christmas]] with Rizal in the cell where they drank pan get and sang together.\n\nAfter Christmas, Rizal was sent to the [[Real Audiencia]], the colonial court of appeal, to hear the trial against him. Soon after, the magistrates decided to condemn him under firing squad on the 30th of the morning in [[Luneta]].\n\nAt the night before the execution, Rizal hallucinates, seeing his [[alter ego]]\u2014[[protagonist]], Crisostomo \"Simoun\" Ibarra, from his second book, ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', tempting him to change the climax of the novel.\n\nOn the morning of his execution, his kin receives a small alcohol stove (not a gas lamp as commonly portrayed) from his cell containing the last poem \"[[Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s]]\". Stopping at the place of execution facing the rising sun, Rizal requested the authorities for him to face the firing squad, but the request was denied. Calm and without haste, he requested to have his head spared instead and the captain agrees. At the moment the shooting squad points at his back, he readily uttered his final words: ''Consummatum est'' (\"It is done\").\n\nIn the events following Rizal's execution, members of the [[Katipunan]] begin their [[Philippine Revolution|armed uprising]], completely catching the Spanish forces off guard, seizing their mounts, munitions and rifles. After that, the organization captures a church and the members execute the friars in an act of vengeance. Later that night, Bonifacio and his top generals meet in their headquarters to plan a new offensive seeking to capture ten towns in a duration of one week from the Spaniards. As Bonifacio continues speaking, the film ends as the camera pans to Rizal's picture at the wall of his headquarters.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cesar Montano]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]\n**Dominic Guinto as young Jos\u00e9 Rizal\n\n===Rizal's loves===\n*[[Chin Chin Gutierrez]] as [[Josephine Bracken]]\n*[[Mickey Ferriols]] as [[Leonor Rivera]]\n\n===Rizal's family===\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ronnie Lazaro]] as [[Francisco Rizal Mercado|Francisco Mercado]]\n*[[Gloria Diaz|Gloria D\u00edaz]] as [[Teodora Alonso Realonda|Teodora Alonso]]\n*[[Pen Medina]] as [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano Mercado]]\n**[[Ping Medina]] as young Paciano Mercado\n*[[Gina Alajar]] as [[Saturnina Hidalgo|Saturnina Rizal]]\n*Tanya Gomez as Narcisa Rizal\n*Tess Dumpit as Mar\u00eda Rizal\n*[[Irma Adlawan]] as Luc\u00eda Rizal\n*Angie Castrence as Josefa Rizal\n*Rowena Basco as Trinidad Rizal\n*Kaye Marie June Congmon as Soledad Rizal\n{{colend}}\n\n===The Spaniards===\n{{colbegin}}\n*Bon Vibar as [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco, 1st Marquis of Pe\u00f1a Plata|Governor-General Ram\u00f3n Blanco]]\n*[[Subas Herrero]] as Lt.

The film was an official entry to the [[Metro Manila Film Festival|1998 Metro Manila Film Festival]]. Upon release, the film met universal critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nJos\u00e9 Rizal was imprisoned in [[Fort Santiago]] under the abusive [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]]. Meanwhile, in Balintawak, [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his fellow secret organization, the [[Katipunan]], commenced the uprising against the tyranny created by the [[Spaniards]] by tearing their cedulas as a sign of freedom from the Spanish slavery.\n\nSoon, a first lieutenant of the Artillery, Luis Taviel de Andrade, visits Rizal. Taviel de Andrade did not waste time to study carefully Rizal's case. In just a short period of time, Rizal and Taviel captured each other's sympathy and eventually became friends as they had usual meetings in Rizal's cell in [[Fort Santiago]]. Taviel was even able to celebrate [[Christmas]] with Rizal in the cell where they drank pan get and sang together.\n\nAfter Christmas, Rizal was sent to the [[Real Audiencia]], the colonial court of appeal, to hear the trial against him. Soon after, the magistrates decided to condemn him under firing squad on the 30th of the morning in [[Luneta]].\n\nAt the night before the execution, Rizal hallucinates, seeing his [[alter ego]]\u2014[[protagonist]], Crisostomo \"Simoun\" Ibarra, from his second book, ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', tempting him to change the climax of the novel.\n\nOn the morning of his execution, his kin receives a small alcohol stove (not a gas lamp as commonly portrayed) from his cell containing the last poem \"[[Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s]]\". Stopping at the place of execution facing the rising sun, Rizal requested the authorities for him to face the firing squad, but the request was denied. Calm and without haste, he requested to have his head spared instead and the captain agrees. At the moment the shooting squad points at his back, he readily uttered his final words: ''Consummatum est'' (\"It is done\").\n\nIn the events following Rizal's execution, members of the [[Katipunan]] begin their [[Philippine Revolution|armed uprising]], completely catching the Spanish forces off guard, seizing their mounts, munitions and rifles. After that, the organization captures a church and the members execute the friars in an act of vengeance. Later that night, Bonifacio and his top generals meet in their headquarters to plan a new offensive seeking to capture ten towns in a duration of one week from the Spaniards. As Bonifacio continues speaking, the film ends as the camera pans to Rizal's picture at the wall of his headquarters.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cesar Montano]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]\n**Dominic Guinto as young Jos\u00e9 Rizal\n\n===Rizal's loves===\n*[[Chin Chin Gutierrez]] as [[Josephine Bracken]]\n*[[Mickey Ferriols]] as [[Leonor Rivera]]\n\n===Rizal's family===\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ronnie Lazaro]] as [[Francisco Rizal Mercado|Francisco Mercado]]\n*[[Gloria Diaz|Gloria D\u00edaz]] as [[Teodora Alonso Realonda|Teodora Alonso]]\n*[[Pen Medina]] as [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano Mercado]]\n**[[Ping Medina]] as young Paciano Mercado\n*[[Gina Alajar]] as [[Saturnina Hidalgo|Saturnina Rizal]]\n*Tanya Gomez as Narcisa Rizal\n*Tess Dumpit as Mar\u00eda Rizal\n*[[Irma Adlawan]] as Luc\u00eda Rizal\n*Angie Castrence as Josefa Rizal\n*Rowena Basco as Trinidad Rizal\n*Kaye Marie June Congmon as Soledad Rizal\n{{colend}}\n\n===The Spaniards===\n{{colbegin}}\n*Bon Vibar as [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco, 1st Marquis of Pe\u00f1a Plata|Governor-General Ram\u00f3n Blanco]]\n*[[Subas Herrero]] as Lt.

Prior to going to Saviours' Day, due to then-Minister [[Malcolm&nbsp;X]]'s media presence, Walcott had never heard of Elijah Muhammad, and like many outside of the Nation of Islam, he thought that Malcolm&nbsp;X was the leader of the Nation of Islam.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn 1955, Walcott fulfilled the requirements to be a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer. He memorized and recited verbatim the 10 questions and answers of the NOI's Student Enrollment. He then wrote a Saviour's Letter that must be sent to the NOI's headquarters in Chicago. The Saviour's Letter must be copied [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]], and have the identical handwriting of the Nation of Islam's founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]]. After having the Saviour's Letter reviewed, and approved by the NOI's headquarters in Chicago in July 1955, Walcott received a letter of approval from the Nation of Islam acknowledging his official membership as a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer in the NOI. As a result, he received his \"X.\" The \"X\" was considered a placeholder, used to indicate that Nation of Islam members' original African family names had been lost. They acknowledged that European surnames were [[slave name]]s, assigned by the slaveowners to mark their ownership. Members of the NOI used the \"X\" while waiting for their Islamic names, which some NOI members received later in their conversion.<ref name=\"Lincoln\">{{cite book|last=Lincoln|first=C.

Eventually he became the official minister after Elijah Muhammad transferred Malcolm&nbsp;X to Muhammad's Temple of Islam No. 7 on West 116th St. in [[Harlem, New York City]]. Louis X continued to be mentored by Malcolm&nbsp;X, until the latter's assassination in 1965. The day that Malcolm&nbsp;X died in Harlem, Farrakhan happened to be in [[Newark, New Jersey]] on rotation, 45 minutes away from where Malcolm&nbsp;X was assassinated. After Malcolm&nbsp;X's death, Elijah Muhammad appointed Farrakhan to the two prominent positions that Malcolm held before being dismissed from the NOI. Farrakhan became the national spokesman/national representative of the NOI and was appointed minister of the influential Harlem Mosque (Temple), where he served until 1975.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nFarrakhan made numerous incendiary statements about Malcolm X, contributing to what was called a \"climate of vilification.\"<ref name=\"Stanford\"/> Three men from a Newark, NOI mosque\u2014[[Thomas Hagan]], Muhammad Abdul Aziz (aka Norman 3X Butler) and Kahlil Islam (aka Thomas 15X Johnson)\u2014were convicted of the killing and served prison sentences.

He rejected the deification of the founder [[Wallace D.

This was distilled in the New York tabloids and other media saying, 'Farrakhan calls Judaism a gutter religion.'\n\nAs a [[Muslim]], I revere Abraham, Moses, and all the Prophets whom Allah (God) sent to the children of Israel. I believe in the scriptures brought by these Prophets and the Laws of Allah (God) as expressed in the Torah. I would never refer to the Revealed Word of Allah (God)\u2014the basis of Jewish Faith\u2014as 'dirty' or 'gutter.' You know, Jude, as well as I, that the Revealed Word of Allah (God) comes as a Message from Allah (God) to purify us from our evil that has divided us and caused us to fall into the gutter.\n\nOver the centuries, the evils of Christians, Jews and Muslims have dirtied their respective religions. True Faith in the laws and Teaching of Abraham, Jesus and Muhammad is not dirty, but, practices in the name of these religions can be unclean and can cause people to look upon the misrepresented religion as being unclean.<ref name=\"noi.org\"/>}}\n\n====Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust====\nIn response to Farrakhan's speech, Nathan Pearlmutter, then Chair of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) of [[B'nai B'rith]], referred to Farrakhan as the new \"Black [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]\" and ''[[Village Voice]]'' journalist [[Nat Hentoff]] also characterized the NOI leader as a \"Black Hitler\"  while a guest on a New York radio talk-show.\n\nIn response, Farrakhan announced during a March 11, 1984, speech broadcast on a Chicago radio station:\n\n{{quote|So I said to the members of the press, 'Why won't you go and look into what we are saying about the threats on Reverend Jackson's life?' Here the Jews don't like Farrakhan and so they call me 'Hitler'. Well that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.

Yet Hitler took Germany from the ashes and rose her up and made her the greatest fighting machine of the twentieth century, brothers and sisters, and even though Europe and America had deciphered the code that Hitler was using to speak to his chiefs of staff, they still had trouble defeating Hitler even after knowing his plans in advance.

In 1953\u20131954, preceding [[Harry Belafonte]]'s success with his album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (released in 1956), he recorded and released a dozen cheeky, funny tunes as \"The Charmer\" in a mixed [[mento]]/[[calypso music|calypso]] style, including \"Ugly Woman\", \"Stone Cold Me\" and calypso standards like \"Zombie Jamboree\", \"Hol 'Em Joe\", \"Mary Ann\" and \"Brown Skin Girl\".

There he first came in contact with the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI) through Rodney Smith, a friend and saxophonist from Boston. Walcott and his wife Betsy were invited to the Nation of Islam's annual [[Saviours' Day]] address by [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Prior to going to Saviours' Day, due to then-Minister [[Malcolm&nbsp;X]]'s media presence, Walcott had never heard of Elijah Muhammad, and like many outside of the Nation of Islam, he thought that Malcolm&nbsp;X was the leader of the Nation of Islam.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn 1955, Walcott fulfilled the requirements to be a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer. He memorized and recited verbatim the 10 questions and answers of the NOI's Student Enrollment. He then wrote a Saviour's Letter that must be sent to the NOI's headquarters in Chicago. The Saviour's Letter must be copied [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]], and have the identical handwriting of the Nation of Islam's founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]]. After having the Saviour's Letter reviewed, and approved by the NOI's headquarters in Chicago in July 1955, Walcott received a letter of approval from the Nation of Islam acknowledging his official membership as a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer in the NOI. As a result, he received his \"X.\" The \"X\" was considered a placeholder, used to indicate that Nation of Islam members' original African family names had been lost. They acknowledged that European surnames were [[slave name]]s, assigned by the slaveowners to mark their ownership. Members of the NOI used the \"X\" while waiting for their Islamic names, which some NOI members received later in their conversion.<ref name=\"Lincoln\">{{cite book|last=Lincoln|first=C.

[[Elijah Muhammad]] then replaced his \"X\" with the \"holy name\" Farrakhan, an [[Arabic]] name meaning \"The Criterion\". On a very different tone from his calypso songs, he nevertheless recorded two tunes as Louis X, criticizing racism in ''A White Man's Heaven Is a Black Man's Hell'' issued on Boston's ''A Moslem Sings'' label in 1960.<ref>Farrakhan's ''A White Man's Heaven Is a Black Man's Hell'' activist song as Louis X was reissued here:https://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=1787&Itemid=13</ref>.\n\nThe summer after Farrakhan's conversion, Elijah Muhammad stated that all musicians in the NOI had to choose between music and the Nation of Islam.<ref name=\"Holland\"/> Louis&nbsp;X did so only after performing one final event at the [[Nevele Grand Hotel|Nevele]], {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} a Jewish resort in the [[Catskills]].\n\nAfter nine months of being a registered Muslim in the NOI and a member of Muhammad's Temple of Islam in Boston, where Malcolm&nbsp;X was the minister, the former calypso-singer turned [[Muslim]] became his assistant minister. Eventually he became the official minister after Elijah Muhammad transferred Malcolm&nbsp;X to Muhammad's Temple of Islam No. 7 on West 116th St. in [[Harlem, New York City]]. Louis X continued to be mentored by Malcolm&nbsp;X, until the latter's assassination in 1965. The day that Malcolm&nbsp;X died in Harlem, Farrakhan happened to be in [[Newark, New Jersey]] on rotation, 45 minutes away from where Malcolm&nbsp;X was assassinated. After Malcolm&nbsp;X's death, Elijah Muhammad appointed Farrakhan to the two prominent positions that Malcolm held before being dismissed from the NOI.

He rejected the deification of the founder [[Wallace D.

This was distilled in the New York tabloids and other media saying, 'Farrakhan calls Judaism a gutter religion.'\n\nAs a [[Muslim]], I revere Abraham, Moses, and all the Prophets whom Allah (God) sent to the children of Israel. I believe in the scriptures brought by these Prophets and the Laws of Allah (God) as expressed in the Torah. I would never refer to the Revealed Word of Allah (God)\u2014the basis of Jewish Faith\u2014as 'dirty' or 'gutter.' You know, Jude, as well as I, that the Revealed Word of Allah (God) comes as a Message from Allah (God) to purify us from our evil that has divided us and caused us to fall into the gutter.\n\nOver the centuries, the evils of Christians, Jews and Muslims have dirtied their respective religions.

The male's plumage is dark and blackish at a distance. A closer view reveals an iridescent mantle of gleaming scales reminiscent in colour and pattern to those seen in the [[ocellated turkey]] and [[green peafowl]]. Each scale is vivid blue at its base and moves through various shades of gold and bronzed green. Specialized plumes framing the throat of the male green junglefowl are highly light-reflective and appear violet at the proximal and sky blue at the distal edges. The lesser coverts of the wing are a striking burnt orange with bronzed black centers. The distal edges of the greater secondary coverts are vivid ocher.\n\nLike the related [[red junglefowl]], the breast and ventral regions are a dense, light-absorbing black. Like its closer relative the [[Sri Lankan junglefowl]], the male green junglefowl exhibits vivid 'windows' of bare facial skin that contrast against the dark scarlet red of the face. The green junglefowl exhibits an ice blue center in its comb. A region of electric yellow facial skin extends below each ear, delineating the plumed hackles from gular lappet. Its head is topped by a light blue comb, which turns purple or red towards the top. Its wattle is also of the same colour but is bordered with blue on the edges and yellow closer to the throat. The female is mostly brown with occasional green feathers and has no comb.\n\n[[File:Stavenn Gallus varius 00.jpg|240px|left|thumb|female]]\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe green junglefowl is endemic to [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]], [[Flores]], [[Rinca]] and small islands linking Java with Flores, [[Indonesia]]. It has been introduced to the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] where there is a small wild population. It is found from a natural altitude of 0 \u2013 2000 m in subtropical/tropical lowland moist forest, shrubland and arable land, and has been seen flying from island to island in its native range, where it lives and breeds along coastal areas.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe green junglefowl usually lives in groups of two to five in the wild led by a dominant male, who takes the [[Flock (birds)|flock]] to feed and drink and then back into the cover of the forest. In the night the flock roosts in bamboo stands at 15\u201320 feet above the forest floor. In the [[breeding season]] the dominant males in each flock are challenged by other males without flocks. The two males clap their wings and crow loudly while fighting each other with their [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]s.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThe green junglefowl is being maintained and increasingly bred in captivity as its [[genetic diversity]] is disappearing. This is because these birds are bred with domestic chickens by many people, producing a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] known as the [[bekisar]]. The bekisar has become very popular in the [[East Java]] province and has become a mascot of the area. A recent genetic study revealed evidence of genetic introgressive hybridization from green junglefowl to domestic chicken.<ref name = Lawal />\n\nThe captive green junglefowl requires warm [[Aviary|aviaries]] with lots of [[foliage]] and cover due to their shy nature and are fed with grains and seeds, as well as fruit and insects as these are the same type of food they would feed on in the wild. This bird has also been known for a long time as a pet animal because of its beauty and unique call.\n\n==Status and conservation==\nThe green junglefowl is evaluated as least concern on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22679213 \"Green Junglefowl Gallus varius\" at BirdLife International]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060204233239/http://www.gbwf.org/pheasants/junglefowl_green.html Green junglefowl information and picture]\n* [http://www.feathersite.com/Poultry/NDG/BRKGreenJF.html Information about the green junglefowl]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090912034932/http://www.seaza.org/scientific_papers/captive_breeding_of_green_jungle_fowl.htm Captive breeding of Green Jungle Fowl (''Gallus varius'') in the TMII Bird Park]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q596325}}\n\n[[Category:Junglefowls]]\n[[Category:Birds of Southeast Asia]]\n[[Category:Birds of Java]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1798]]\n[[Category:Birds of Lombok]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by George Shaw]]\n", "text_old": "{{morefootnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{short description|Species of bird}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{speciesbox\n| name = Green junglefowl\n| image = Green Junglefowl (Gallus varius) (7936877492).jpg\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22679213/0 |title=''Gallus varius'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Gallus\n| species = varius\n| authority = [[George Shaw|Shaw]], 1798\n| range_map = Gallus distribution.jpg\n| range_map_caption =\n:{{leftlegend|#876236|''Gallus varius''}}\n:{{leftlegend|#B28318|''[[Gallus gallus|G. gallus]]'' <small>([[Sympatry|sympatric]])</small>}}\n:{{leftlegend|#9ACD32|''[[Gallus lafayettii|G. lafayettii]]''}}\n:{{leftlegend|#6B8E23|''[[Gallus sonneratii|G. sonneratii]]''}}\n}}\n\nThe '''green junglefowl''' (''Gallus varius''), also known as '''Javan junglefowl''', '''forktail''' or '''green Javanese junglefowl''', is the most distantly related and the first to diverge at least 4 million years ago among the four species of the [[Junglefowl]].<ref name=Lawal>{{ cite journal | last1=Lawal | first1=RA. | display-authors=etal  | year=2020 | title=The wild species genome ancestry of domestic chickens | journal=BMC Biology | volume=18 | issue=13 | pages=13 | doi=10.1186/s12915-020-0738-1 | doi-access=free | pmid=32050971 }}</ref>.
