Hammersley won a scholarship to [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] to train as a deck officer but his eyesight was too poor so he chose to become an engineer instead, studying at the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]].  He trained onboard [[HMS Frobisher (D81)|HMS ''Frobisher'']] and [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and served on  [[HMS Ocean (R68)|HMS ''Ocean'']] during the [[Korean War]].  Hammersley later specialised in submarines and in 1959 served on secondment to the [[US Navy]] on the nuclear submarine [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']].  Afterwards he served as nuclear engineering officer aboard the Royal Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].  Hammersley helped design the [[Swiftsure-class submarine|''Swiftsure''-class of submarines]]  and commanded a number of shore installations including the Royal Naval Engineering College.  He served as [[aide-de-camp]] to Queen Elizabeth II and was Chief Staff Officer Engineering for the fleet in the 1982 [[Falklands War]].

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply. For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity.<ref name=\"refMM\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz Melnick & Adelbergs Medical Microbiology 28E |author=Stephen A.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\":0\" /> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\":0\" />, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease.

Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions. This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA. Namely, viral proteins of herpes simplex virus can degrade host DNA and inhibit host cell DNA replication and mRNA transcription. Poliovirus can inactivate proteins involved in host mRNA translation without affecting poliovirus mRNA translation.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\">{{Cite book|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology|last=MacLachlan|first=James|last2=Dubovi|first2=Edward|date=2011|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780123751584|edition=4th}}</ref> In some cases, expression of viral fusion proteins on the surface of the host cells can cause host cell fusion to form multinucleated cells.

In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply. For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity. \n\n===Important steps of a virus life cycle that shape pathogenesis:===\n{{see also|Viral life cycle}}\n[[File:Typical sites of virus entry into the body.png|thumb|300px|right|Typical sites of virus entry into the body: The first steps of viral infection is determined by the site at which the virus implants into the body.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\":0\" /> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\":0\" />, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host.

Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions. This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

The ranking at the end of the calendar year will be utilised to award an annual winner. Unlike previous ranking systems the UCI World Classification will include <u>all</u> male riders from the World Tour down to U23 riders. Points will be awarded on all races from World Tour level down to 1.2 and 2.2 races.\n|-\n| UCI World Ranking by nations || This is based on the world ranking with the best eight riders from each country contributing towards their nation's overall score.\n|-\n|UCI WorldTour Rankings || This is the UCI WorldTour ranking of riders, teams and nations taking part in the events of the UCI WorldTour. Only riders being part of a UCI WorldTeam obtain points in UCI WorldTour races.\n|-\n| Continental Ranking || There will be subsets of rankings which are made up from points scored in non-World Tour races (i.e, UCI Europe Tour, UCI Asia Tour etc) for individuals, teams and nations. This will therefore allow one rider to appear in more than one ranking, for example a rider who won Strade Bianchi and a stage in the Tour of California would be part of the Europe Tour and America Tour rankings.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Previous and current ranking systems===\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:1200 height:300\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:4 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\n\nAlignBars  = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1945 till:31/12/2030\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:year increment:5 start:01/01/1945\n\nColors =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.95)\n  id:1     value:rgb(1,0,0) legend:Challenge_Desgrange-Colombo_(1948\u20131958)\n  id:2     value:rgb(1,0.3,0) legend:Super_Prestige_Pernod_International_(1958\u20131988)\n  id:3     value:rgb(1,0.5,0) legend:UCI_Road_World_Rankings_(1984\u20132004)\n  id:4     value:rgb(1,0.8,0) legend:UCI_Road_World_Cup_(1989\u20132004)\n  id:5     value:rgb(1,0.9,0) legend:UCI_ProTour_(2005\u20132010)\n  id:6     value:rgb(0.5,1,0.2) legend:UCI_Africa_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:7     value:rgb(0.45,1,0) legend:UCI_America_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:8     value:rgb(0,1,0) legend:UCI_Asia_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:9     value:rgb(0.2,0.8,0.2) legend:UCI_Europe_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:10     value:rgb(0,0.5,0) legend:UCI_Oceania_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:11     value:rgb(0,0.8,1) legend:UCI_World_Tour_(2009\u2013_2018)\n  id:12    value:rgb(0,0,1) legend:UCI_World_Rankings_(2016\u2013_Present)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:M shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:01/01/1948 till:01/01/1958 color:1 text:[[Challenge Desgrange-Colombo]]\n  from:01/01/1958 till:31/12/1988 color:2 text:[[Super_Prestige_Pernod_International]]\n  from:01/01/1984 till:31/12/2004 color:3 text:[[UCI Road World Rankings]]\n  from:01/01/1989 till:31/12/2004 color:4 text:[[UCI Road World Cup]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2010 color:5 text:[[UCI ProTour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:6 text:[[UCI Africa Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:7 text:[[UCI America Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:8 text:[[UCI Asia Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:9 text:[[UCI Europe Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:10 text:[[UCI Oceania Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2009 till:31/12/2018 color:11 text:[[UCI World Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2016 till:31/12/2019 color:12 text:[[UCI World Ranking]]\n  barset:break\n\n  bar:month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/1945 till:31/12/1945 text:1945\n  from:01/01/1950 till:31/12/1950 text:1950\n  from:01/01/1955 till:31/12/1955 text:1955\n  from:01/01/1960 till:31/12/1960 text:1960\n  from:01/01/1965 till:31/12/1965 text:1965\n  from:01/01/1970 till:31/12/1970 text:1970\n  from:01/01/1975 till:31/12/1975 text:1975\n  from:01/01/1980 till:31/12/1980 text:1980\n  from:01/01/1985 till:31/12/1985 text:1985\n  from:01/01/1990 till:31/12/1990 text:1990\n  from:01/01/1995 till:31/12/1995 text:1995\n  from:01/01/2000 till:31/12/2000 text:2000\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 text:2005\n  from:01/01/2010 till:31/12/2010 text:2010\n  from:01/01/2015 till:31/12/2015 text:2015\n  from:01/01/2020 till:31/12/2020 text:2020\n  from:01/01/2025 till:31/12/2025 text:2025\n  from:01/01/2030 till:31/12/2030 text:2030\n\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\n   pos:(617,30)\n   text:\n</timeline></center>\n\n==Explanation of the men's ranking points system==\n\n===UCI events===\n\n====Points hierarchy for overall placings====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||colspan=5 align=center|<small>'''UCI WorldTour'''</small> ||colspan=6 align=center|<small>'''UCI Continental Tours'''</small>\n|-\n!

This will therefore allow one rider to appear in more than one ranking, for example a rider who won Strade Bianchi and a stage in the Tour of California would be part of the Europe Tour and America Tour rankings.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Previous and current ranking systems===\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:1200 height:300\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:4 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\n\nAlignBars  = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1945 till:31/12/2030\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:year increment:5 start:01/01/1945\n\nColors =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.95)\n  id:1     value:rgb(1,0,0) legend:Challenge_Desgrange-Colombo_(1948\u20131958)\n  id:2     value:rgb(1,0.3,0) legend:Super_Prestige_Pernod_International_(1958\u20131988)\n  id:3     value:rgb(1,0.5,0) legend:UCI_Road_World_Rankings_(1984\u20132004)\n  id:4     value:rgb(1,0.8,0) legend:UCI_Road_World_Cup_(1989\u20132004)\n  id:5     value:rgb(1,0.9,0) legend:UCI_ProTour_(2005\u20132010)\n  id:6     value:rgb(0.5,1,0.2) legend:UCI_Africa_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:7     value:rgb(0.45,1,0) legend:UCI_America_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:8     value:rgb(0,1,0) legend:UCI_Asia_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:9     value:rgb(0.2,0.8,0.2) legend:UCI_Europe_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:10     value:rgb(0,0.5,0) legend:UCI_Oceania_Tour_(2005\u2013_Present)\n  id:11     value:rgb(0,0.8,1) legend:UCI_World_Tour_(2009\u2013_2018)\n  id:12    value:rgb(0,0,1) legend:UCI_World_Rankings_(2016\u2013_Present)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:M shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:01/01/1948 till:01/01/1958 color:1 text:[[Challenge Desgrange-Colombo]]\n  from:01/01/1958 till:31/12/1988 color:2 text:[[Super_Prestige_Pernod_International]]\n  from:01/01/1984 till:31/12/2004 color:3 text:[[UCI Road World Rankings]]\n  from:01/01/1989 till:31/12/2004 color:4 text:[[UCI Road World Cup]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2010 color:5 text:[[UCI ProTour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:6 text:[[UCI Africa Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:7 text:[[UCI America Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:8 text:[[UCI Asia Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:9 text:[[UCI Europe Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2019 color:10 text:[[UCI Oceania Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2009 till:31/12/2018 color:11 text:[[UCI World Tour]]\n  from:01/01/2016 till:31/12/2019 color:12 text:[[UCI World Ranking]]\n  barset:break\n\n  bar:month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/1945 till:31/12/1945 text:1945\n  from:01/01/1950 till:31/12/1950 text:1950\n  from:01/01/1955 till:31/12/1955 text:1955\n  from:01/01/1960 till:31/12/1960 text:1960\n  from:01/01/1965 till:31/12/1965 text:1965\n  from:01/01/1970 till:31/12/1970 text:1970\n  from:01/01/1975 till:31/12/1975 text:1975\n  from:01/01/1980 till:31/12/1980 text:1980\n  from:01/01/1985 till:31/12/1985 text:1985\n  from:01/01/1990 till:31/12/1990 text:1990\n  from:01/01/1995 till:31/12/1995 text:1995\n  from:01/01/2000 till:31/12/2000 text:2000\n  from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 text:2005\n  from:01/01/2010 till:31/12/2010 text:2010\n  from:01/01/2015 till:31/12/2015 text:2015\n  from:01/01/2020 till:31/12/2020 text:2020\n  from:01/01/2025 till:31/12/2025 text:2025\n  from:01/01/2030 till:31/12/2030 text:2030\n\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\n   pos:(617,30)\n   text:\n</timeline></center>\n\n==Explanation of the men's ranking points system==\n\n===UCI events===\n\n====Points hierarchy for overall placings====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||colspan=5 align=center|<small>'''UCI WorldTour'''</small> ||colspan=6 align=center|<small>'''UCI Continental Tours'''</small>\n|-\n!

He was actively involved in the management and engineering support of the D&KR{{Sfnp|Murray|1982|p=22}} and the later [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] throughout their construction and for their operational life until 1856.  A life member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] he is also known for invention of a patented spring-loaded [[Buffer (rail transport)|rail buffer]].\n\n==Biography==\nThere appears to be little or no immediately available information on Bergin's formative years.

For the D&KR it permitted the testing of their locomotives and even a trial of the track construction technique the D&KR was to use.  The L&MR had a problem with the connections to its rail carriages experiencing severe jolting on starting and stopping, and also a tendency to snake when moving along.  The L&MR's carriages originally did not have buffers in the first two years of operation.  An initial early form of connecting buffers was introduced on the L&MR, which was on the two buffer arrangement.  Bergin's central buffer appear to improve this greatly with great strength being achieved with its longitudinal central arrangement even being tested on the L&MR to withstand a locomotive to carriage collision at 15mph without damage.  The device also allowed to L&MR's carriages to be constructed with less weight, however at least some called the device over-complicated.{{cn|date=March 2020}}  The L&MR investigated the Bergin Buffer in 1835,{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=174}}  but the L&MR seem to have then improved their buffers with at least source indicating one improvement was derived from the Bergin device, and the L&MR twin buffer arrangement was the one that spread.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n{{harv|Snell|1921|pp=40\u201341}} Claims the utility of the spring buffer was first recognised on the D&KR, though Snell also claims Bergin's device was unreliable in practice due to its complexity.\nWith the take over of the D&KR and conversion to {{Track gauge|irish gauge}} {{Circa}}1856 rolling stock had the Bergin buffer removed and replaced by a then standard twin buffer arrangement.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=193}}\n\n==={{Anchor|A-velocipede}}Rope driven row-boat patent===\nBergin together with [[James Pim]] put forward a patent for a rope driven \"Row-boat\" in 1837; a man-powered rail [[handcar]].{{Sfnp|Velocipedes|2016|pp=1\u20132}}{{efn|It is pragmattically probable at least one was built and tried on the D&KR however functionally similar and possibly better crank and polling based cars may have existed by this point.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Cooper |first= Daniel | date = 1842 | title=The Microscopic Miscellany; being selections from the Microscopic Journal\n     | url=https://archive.org/details/microscopicmisce00cooprich | location=London |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Donaghy|first=Thomas J|date=1972|title=Liverpool & Manchester Railway operations, 1831-1845\n     |oclc=637059|isbn=9780715357057|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, Devon|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Grierson|first=Thomas B|date=1887|title=The enlargement of Westland Row Terminus Part I\n     |journal=Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|volume=18|url=https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-018_001|access-date=23 July 2019\n     |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723153025/https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-022_001|archive-date=23 July 2019|df=dmy-all|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Digges La Touche|first=J.

The Sharp's engine ''Hibernia'' achieved 60 mph light engine.{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=185}}{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n* With days of the locomotive [[Dodds Horsley Star (locomotive)|''Star'']] arriving at the D&KR in September 1835, Bergin was furious the at the dangerous state of repair of the small wheels and demanded replacements from Forrester \"or some other Lancashire house\".{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=184}}{{efn|{{harv|Murray|1981|p=184}} Notes this as possibly a tactless insult invoking traditional Yorkshire versus Lancashire rivalry, however Horsley Ironworks was at [[Tipton]] and design Dodds  was from County Durham.}}\n* Bergin withheld payments on the three Sharps locomotives for a year for excessive maintenance demands.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=182}}\n* The locomotives built by the D&KR's own [[Grand Canal Street railway works|Grand Canal Street works]] were a development of the Forrester design.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=187}}\n\n===Other interests===\nBergin seems to have had other interests outside the railways, perhaps particularly as indicated by his membership of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA) to which he was elected on 30 November 1836.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}  Bergin is noted having authored or contributed to the RIA's proceedings with papers: \"On an Aurora\", \"On Talbotized Photogenic Paper\", \"On Preservation of Rusted Antiquities\" and \"On illuminatation of Objects in a microscope.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}\n\nHe was President of the [[Microscopical Society of Ireland#Earlier Societies|Microscopical Society of Dublin]].{{Sfnp|Cooper|1842|p=158}}.  \n\nBergin also seemed interested in objects he came across in his travels, presenting some stones to the RIA that appear to have come from altars{{Sfnp|RIA|1850|p=273}} and on 14 September 1846 whilst near Craigha Moira in Connemara alighted from his outside car and noted and picked some unusual heather known as [[Erica ciliaris]] normally only found in the British Isles in South West England.{{Sfnp|Society|1981|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n====Nicholas Chain Bridge====\nBergin had a minor interest in the [[Nicholas Chain Bridge]], the {{Convert|776|m|ft}} bridge over the [[Dnieper]] in [[Kiev]] being the largest in Europe at the time of its completion in 1855.  Vignoles visited Bergin in November 1846 to check his calculations for the bridge were correct.  Bergin checked the calculations and suggested Vignolas sent them to E. Whiteford, \"a mathematician of hig repute\" at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], for verification.  Vignolas, wishing to make absolutely sure there were no errors, spent a three day visit with Bergin meeting [[Thomas Romney Robinson]] at the [[Armagh Observatory]].{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=331}}\n\n===Retirement===\nBergin retired when the operation of the D&KR was taken over by the [[Dublin and Wicklow Railway]] in 1856, having remained loyal to the D&KR despite offers from other railways.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He died in December 1862.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He had built up a significant library of work that was auctioned in 1863.\n\n====Surviving artifacts====\nTwo significant personal possessions of Bergin's have survived into perhaps slightly unexpected collections.  A [[microscope]] was purchased by the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] for \u00a3140 in 1863 and remains in their heritage collection, and a French [[aneroid barometer]] has found its way to the [[Western Australian Museum]].{{Sfnp|Mollan|1995|loc=4252 RCS002 & Ex0563}}{{efn|As of 2020 the current reference for the Dublin microscope is RCSI/M/6}}\n\n==Inventions==\n\n===Buffer invention===\n[[File:Dublin Penny Journal 1835-12-26 Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway Second Class Carriage by E. Heyden.png|thumb|Illustration of the \"Bergin Buffer\" on D&KR carriage with a cutaway version showing the spring buffer at either end of the vehicle.]]\nThe [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), which had successfully operated since 1830, facilitated the testing of locomotives and viewing of operations by other railways, sometimes taking on improvements from such demonstrations. themselves.  For the D&KR it permitted the testing of their locomotives and even a trial of the track construction technique the D&KR was to use.  The L&MR had a problem with the connections to its rail carriages experiencing severe jolting on starting and stopping, and also a tendency to snake when moving along.  The L&MR's carriages originally did not have buffers in the first two years of operation.  An initial early form of connecting buffers was introduced on the L&MR, which was on the two buffer arrangement.  Bergin's central buffer appear to improve this greatly with great strength being achieved with its longitudinal central arrangement even being tested on the L&MR to withstand a locomotive to carriage collision at 15mph without damage.  The device also allowed to L&MR's carriages to be constructed with less weight, however at least some called the device over-complicated.{{cn|date=March 2020}}  The L&MR investigated the Bergin Buffer in 1835,{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=174}}  but the L&MR seem to have then improved their buffers with at least source indicating one improvement was derived from the Bergin device, and the L&MR twin buffer arrangement was the one that spread.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n{{harv|Snell|1921|pp=40\u201341}} Claims the utility of the spring buffer was first recognised on the D&KR, though Snell also claims Bergin's device was unreliable in practice due to its complexity.\nWith the take over of the D&KR and conversion to {{Track gauge|irish gauge}} {{Circa}}1856 rolling stock had the Bergin buffer removed and replaced by a then standard twin buffer arrangement.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=193}}\n\n==={{Anchor|A-velocipede}}Rope driven row-boat patent===\nBergin together with [[James Pim]] put forward a patent for a rope driven \"Row-boat\" in 1837; a man-powered rail [[handcar]].{{Sfnp|Velocipedes|2016|pp=1\u20132}}{{efn|It is pragmattically probable at least one was built and tried on the D&KR however functionally similar and possibly better crank and polling based cars may have existed by this point.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Cooper |first= Daniel | date = 1842 | title=The Microscopic Miscellany; being selections from the Microscopic Journal\n     | url=https://archive.org/details/microscopicmisce00cooprich | location=London |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Donaghy|first=Thomas J|date=1972|title=Liverpool & Manchester Railway operations, 1831-1845\n     |oclc=637059|isbn=9780715357057|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, Devon|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Grierson|first=Thomas B|date=1887|title=The enlargement of Westland Row Terminus Part I\n     |journal=Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|volume=18|url=https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-018_001|access-date=23 July 2019\n     |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723153025/https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-022_001|archive-date=23 July 2019|df=dmy-all|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Digges La Touche|first=J.

In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892\u2013907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the [[feudal]] system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.\n\nThe Samanid Empire is part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], which saw the creation of a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year. Muhammad ibn Harun thereafter fled to [[Daylam]], while Ismail reconquered Tabaristan and Gorgan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}} In 901, [[Amr ibn al-Layth|Amr Saffari]] was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, which reduced the Saffarid dynasty to a minor tributary in Sistan.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=35}} It was during this period that the Samanids were at their height of power, ruling as far as [[Qazvin]] in the west<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-b-ahmad-b-asad-samani |title=ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL, b.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off.

Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory.

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was in the start given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), while it was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could in the Samanid state rise to high offices, which would sometimes result the Turkic slaves usurp power, almost making the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it was by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and its surroundings by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl.

However, it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans, nor at arboreality as non-human great apes. Its discovery, along with [[Miocene]] apes, has reworked academic understanding of the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor]] from appearing much like modern day [[chimp]]s, [[orangutan]]s, and [[gorilla]]s to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate.\n\nThe facial anatomy suggests that ''A. ramidus'' males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps, which is correlated to increased parental care and [[monogamy]] in primates. It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language, possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant. ''A. ramidus'' appears to have inhabited [[woodland]] and [[bushland]] corridors between savannas, and was a generalized [[omnivore]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Image:Map of the fossil sites of the earliest hominids (35.8-3.3M BP).svg|thumb|left|Map showing discovery locations of various [[australopithecine]]s]]\nThe first remains were described in 1994 by American anthropologist [[Tim D.

Their discovery led to the postulation that modern great apes, much like humans, evolved several specialized adaptations to their environment (have highly [[synapomorphy and apomorphy|derived]] morphologies), and their ancestors were comparatively poorly adapted to [[suspensory behavior]] or knuckle walking, and did not have such a specialized diet. Also, the origins of bipedality were thought to have occurred due to a switch from a forest to a savanna environment, but the presence of bipedal pre-''Australopithecus'' hominins in [[woodland]]s has called this into question,<ref name=Lovejoy2009c/> though they inhabited wooded corridors near or between savannas.

''A. ramidus'', unlike modern [[hominid]]s, has adaptations for both walking on two legs ([[biped]]ality) and life in the trees ([[arboreal]]ity). However, it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans, nor at arboreality as non-human great apes. Its discovery, along with [[Miocene]] apes, has reworked academic understanding of the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor]] from appearing much like modern day [[chimp]]s, [[orangutan]]s, and [[gorilla]]s to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate.\n\nThe facial anatomy suggests that ''A. ramidus'' males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps, which is correlated to increased parental care and [[monogamy]] in primates. It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language, possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant. ''A. ramidus'' appears to have inhabited [[woodland]] and [[bushland]] corridors between savannas, and was a generalized [[omnivore]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Image:Map of the fossil sites of the earliest hominids (35.8-3.3M BP).svg|thumb|left|Map showing discovery locations of various [[australopithecine]]s]]\nThe first remains were described in 1994 by American anthropologist [[Tim D.

They argued that self domestication was aided by the development of vocalization, living in a pro-social society, as a means of non-violently dealing with conflict. They conceded that chimps and ''A. ramidus'' likely had the same vocal capabilities, but said that ''A. ramidus'' made use of more complex vocalizations, and vocalized at the same level as a human infant due to [[selective pressure]] to become more social. This would have allowed their society to become more complex. They also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility, whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood; and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability.
